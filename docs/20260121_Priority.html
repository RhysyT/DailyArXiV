We use the ultra-deep data to identify new counterimages for previously confirmed (spectroscopically) lensed systems. We use the full set of spectroscopically confirmed systems to derive a new lens model, which is later used to confirm many of the previous lensed system candidates and discover new lensed system candidates in the images. We compute the geometric redshifts, time delays, and magnification for all counterimages (confirmed and not confirmed). Among the new systems we find a peculiar multiply lensed galaxy with a strong emission line at $\approx 4\, \mu$m that likely corresponds to H$-\beta$ and/or OIII at $z\approx 7.5$. This galaxy could be a little-red-dot or an extreme emission line galaxy. We also identify a yellow supergiant lensed star candidate at $z\approx 3.1$. This star shows some similarities with previous Kaiju stars and we nickname it &quot;Hedorah&quot;, in honor of the famous yellow-eyed Kaiju. Previous lensed stars at $z&gt;0.1$ are either blue supergiants or red supergiants, making Hedorah the first yellow supergiant discovered beyond $z=0.1$ and confirming that, despite their rarity, they can also be found at these redshifts. Since many Cepheid stars are yellow supergiants, we consider the possibility that Hedorah could also be the first Cepheid discovered at cosmological distances, but we conclude that Hedorah is more likely a hypergiant yellow star approaching the end of its life. Alternatively, Hedorah could be a small group of stars, although this is less likely based on Hedorah's peculiar colors and additionally may require the more exotic fuzzy dark matter to help explain the lack of counterimage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant Scattering of the He I 1.0833$μ$m Triplet in H II Regions: Emission Spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.11710]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Resonant scattering of He I 1.0833$\mu$m triplet photons by metastable He 2 $^3$S$_1$ is studied for optical depths characteristic of H II regions. Regions with large He 2 $^3$S$_1$ column densities are predicted to have unusually broad, multi-peaked 1.0833$\mu$m emission profiles, with the centroid blue-shifted by up to $\sim$14 km/s relative to other lines. The feature FWHM can exceed 100 km/s for some regions. Resonant trapping enhances dust absorption and reduces the He I 1.0833$\mu$m emission. Care must be taken when using the He I 1.0833$\mu$m/H I 1.0941$\mu$m (Pa$\gamma$) ratio to estimate the He$^+$/H$^+$ ratio. Predicted spectra are computed for examples, including M-17B and NGC3603 in the Galaxy, and a star-forming region in M51. Observations of the 1.0833$\mu$m triplet with spectrometers such as NIRSPEC, CARMENES, or X-Shooter can confirm the predicted effects of resonant scattering in H II regions, and constrain the nebular conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) IV: CO gas imaging and overview</a><span class="id">[2601.11712]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CO gas is detected in a significant number of debris discs, but its origin and evolution remains unclear. Key constraints are its mass and spectro-spatial distribution, which are coupled through optical depth and have only been analysed at low to moderate resolution so far. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is the first ALMA large program to target debris discs at high spectro-spatial resolution. We used $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO J=3-2 line data of 18 ARKS debris belts, 5 of which were already known to host gas, to analyse the spectro-spatial distribution of CO, constrain the gas masses, and to search for gas in the remaining systems. We developed a line-imaging pipeline and produced line cubes for each disc, with a spatial resolution down to $\sim$70 mas and spectral resolution of 26 m s$^{-1}$. Using spectro-spatial shifting and stacking, we produced high signal-to-noise maps, and radial and spectral profiles that reveal the distribution and kinematics of gas in 5 gas-bearing discs. For these discs, we constrained the inner radius of the $^{12}$CO, and found the radial brightness profile of CO peaked interior to the dust ring, but that CO was more radially extended than the dust. We present the first radially resolved $^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO isotopologue flux ratios in gas-bearing debris discs, which are constant with radius for the majority of systems, indicating $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO are both optically thick or thin throughout the discs. We report CO line fluxes/upper limits for all systems and optical depth dependant masses for the 5 gas-bearing systems. Finally, we analysed the $^{12}$CO J=3-2 line luminosities for the ARKS debris discs and discs from the literature. We confirm that gas is mostly detected in young systems. However, the high scatter seen in young/high fractional luminosity systems indicates no trend within the systems with detected gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blobs and Blurs: A Citizen Science-Identified Catalog of Diffuse Galaxies in the Fornax Cluster</a><span class="id">[2601.11715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a catalog of 643 diffuse galaxies identified through a citizen science search of the Fornax cluster, of which we estimate 21.8% are nucleated (139/637; 6 inconclusive). This marks the first crowd-sourced effort to construct a cluster-scale census of diffuse galaxies. These objects were visually identified using a combination of the Fornax Deep Survey and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey imaging across 26 deg$^2$. Over 1,400 volunteers cataloged the candidates within this sky area at a rate of 1.15 days/deg$^2$. Our catalog is highly complete relative to existing dwarf catalogs of Fornax ($&gt; 80\%$ of objects recovered) down to an effective radius $r_{\mathrm{eff}} = 5^{\prime \prime}$, the minimum size we suggested volunteers classify, and to an effective r-band surface brightness as faint as $\langle \mu_r \rangle \simeq26$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We detect 97 candidates that existing automated searches of Fornax did not find and three candidates not found by any prior search, automated or visual. The stellar mass distribution of our sample is consistent with similar dwarf studies of Fornax, with the nucleated fraction peaking at 80% for a host galaxy mass of $\sim$10$^{8.5}M_{\odot}$. The efficiency and completeness of our catalog thus establishes citizen science as a valuable tool for mapping diffuse galaxy populations in future sky surveys, such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of attenuation on cosmic-ray chemistry: I. Abundances and chemical calibrators in molecular clouds</a><span class="id">[2601.11761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The chemistry of shielded molecular gas is primarily driven by energetic, charged particles dubbed cosmic rays (CRs), in particular those with energies under 1 GeV. CRs ionize molecular hydrogen and helium, the latter of which contributes greatly to the destruction of molecules. CR ionization initiates a wide range of gas-phase chemistry, including pathways important for the so-called &quot;carbon cycle&quot;, C$^+$/C/CO. Therefore, the CR ionization rate, $\zeta$, is fundamental in theoretical and observational astrochemistry. Although observational methods show a wide range of ionization rates – varying with the environment, especially decreasing into dense clouds – astrochemical models often assume a constant rate. To address this limitation, we employ a post-processed gas-phase chemical model of a simulated dense molecular cloud that incorporates CR energy losses within the cloud. This approach allows us to investigate changes in abundance profiles of important chemical tracers and gas temperature. Furthermore, we analyze analytical calibrators for estimating $\zeta$ in dense molecular gas that are robust when tested against a full chemical network. Additionally, we provide improved estimations of the electron fraction in dense gas for better consistency with observational data and theoretical calibrations for UV-shielded regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the role of gravity, turbulence, and the magnetic field in angular momentum transfer within molecular clouds</a><span class="id">[2601.11830]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of molecular structures on scales of $\sim 0.1-50$ pc show that the specific angular momentum ($j$) scales with radius ($R$) as $j\sim R^{3/2}$. We study the effects of turbulence, gravity, and the magnetic field in shaping this scaling, by measuring clump size and specific angular momentum in three SPH simulations of the formation of giant molecular clouds, progressively adding these three ingredients. In each simulation, we define “full” and “reduced” clump samples, the latter restricted to aspect ratios $A&lt;3$. We find that, in the non-magnetic runs, elongated clumps deviate the most from the \jR\ relation, which is best reproduced by the reduced sample in the gravity+turbulence run. In the purely hydrodynamic case, no dense elongated structures form, suggesting that turbulence alone is insufficient to generate dense filaments, although clumps have $j$ magnitudes consistent with observations. In the gravity+turbulence+magnetic field run, most of the clumps are filamentary, yet the full sample appears to follow the observed \jR\ relation. This result, rather than being a real trend, could be the combination of the increase in $j$ by the filamentary geometry, and its reduction by turbulence inhibition by the magnetic field. Finally, we measure the gravitational, magnetic, pressure-gradient, and hydrodynamic torques (which involve turbulent viscosity) in our clump samples. We find that, in magnitude, the hydrodynamic torques tend to be larger than the rest. This result is consistent with our previous work, where we proposed that gravity drives cloud formation and contraction, while turbulence redistributes angular momentum through fluid-parcel exchanges.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: Early Release Observations – The extended stellar component of the IC10 dwarf galaxy</a><span class="id">[2601.11997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed analysis of the old, extended stellar component of the Local Group dwarf galaxy IC 10 using deep resolved-star photometry in the VIS and NISP bands of the Euclid Early Release Observations. Leveraging Euclid's unique combination of wide field of view and high spatial resolution, we trace red giant branch (RGB) stars out to $\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy centre, reaching azimuthally-averaged surface brightness levels as faint as $\mu_{HE}\sim$29 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Our analysis reveals that IC 10's stellar distribution is significantly more extended than previously thought. After correcting for foreground extinction and subtracting contamination from Milky Way stars and background galaxies, we derive a radial stellar density profile from RGB star counts. The profile shows a marked flattening beyond $\sim$5 kpc, and is best fit by a two-component (Sersic + exponential) model, yielding a total stellar mass in old (age $&gt;$1 Gyr) stars of $M_{\star}=(6.7-8.1)\times10^8 M_{\odot}$. The origin of the outer stellar component is unclear. It may be accreted, even possibly associated with the counter-rotating HI gas in the outer regions of IC 10, or it may represent an ancient in-situ stellar halo. We tentatively detect two symmetric stellar overdensities at the edge of our imagery. These roughly align with the direction of IC 10's orbit around M31, suggesting that they may be signatures of tidal stripping. As part of our analysis, we derive a new distance to IC 10 based on the RGB tip, finding $D=762\pm 20$ kpc and the distance modulus is $(m-M)_0=24.41\pm 0.05$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The identification of new Herbig Ae/Be stars from LAMOST DR7</a><span class="id">[2601.12007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) are critical tracers of intermediate- and high-mass star formation, yet their census remains incomplete compared to low-mass young stellar objects like T-Tauri stars. To expand the known population, we systematically searched for HAeBes in LAMOST DR7 low-resolution spectra. Following Sun et al., we applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification, identifying $\sim$240,000 spectra with potential H$\alpha$ emission. After removing contaminants (non-stellar objects, extragalactic sources, CVs, and Algol systems) and restricting to B/A-type stars, we obtained 1,835 candidates through 2MASS/WISE visual inspection. Spectral energy distribution analysis confirmed 143 sources with infrared excess ($J$-band or longer wavelengths), including 92 known HAeBes. From the remaining 51 candidates, we classified 26 with strong infrared excess as new HAeBes. Color-index analysis of confirmed HAeBes and classical Ae/Be stars (CAeBes) revealed that the $(K-W1)_0$ vs. $(W2-W3)_0$ diagram effectively separates these populations: CAeBes predominantly occupy $(K-W1)_0 \leq 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 \leq 1.1$, while other regions trace transition disks ($(K-W1)_0 &lt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &gt; 1.1$), globally depleted disks ($(K-W1)_0 &gt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &lt; 1.1$), and Class I/Flat/II HAeBes ($(K-W1)_0 &gt; 0.5$ and $(W2-W3)_0 &gt; 1.1$). More importantly, the HAeBes exhibit a clear evolutionary gradient on this diagram, with those in the Class III, Class II, Flat-SED, and Class I evolutionary stages being effectively distinguished by concentric ellipses that are roughly centered at (0,0) with semi-major axes of $a$=1.5, $a$=3.0, and $a$=4.0, and a semi-major to semi-minor axis ratio of 1.6:1.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconciling the Systemic Kicks of Observed Millisecond Pulsars, Spider Pulsars, and Low-mass X-ray Binaries</a><span class="id">[2601.12275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) have been proposed as evolutionary products of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) through a stage in which they are spider pulsars (i.e., redbacks and black widows). However, recent work has found that the systemic kicks of observed MSPs are significantly lower than the kicks of LMXBs and spiders, which appears to be in tension with this evolutionary model. We argue that this tension can be relieved, at least to some degree, by considering the fact that the observed MSPs are located at relatively short distances, whereas spider pulsars are located at greater distances and LMXBs are situated even further away. We model the distance-dependent kinematic bias for dynamically old objects, which favors observing objects that have received low kicks at short distances and correct the observed systemic kicks for this bias. We find that this kinematic bias can be big enough to close the gap between the MSP and LMXB kicks, although the spider pulsars appear to come from a slightly different systemic kick distribution, but this difference is not necessarily physical. All corrected systemic kick distributions are consistent with predictions from binary population synthesis for progenitor systems with a post-supernova orbital period of $P_{\text{orb}}\leq10\,$d and a companion mass of $M_{c}\leq1\,M_{\odot}$, where the natal kicks are calibrated to the velocities of young isolated pulsars. We conclude that the difference in observed systemic kicks is not necessarily in tension with a common origin for MSPs, spider pulsars, and LMXBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The MAGPI Survey: co-evolution of baryons and dark matter in star-forming disk-like galaxies at $0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$</a><span class="id">[2601.12315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of the dark matter (DM) content and its structural dependence in star-forming disk-like galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($0.1 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.85$), utilizing spatially resolved kinematic data from the MAGPI survey. We report the following: (1) Low stellar mass galaxies ($M_{\rm star} &lt; 10^{9.5}\, M_\odot$) are strongly DM dominated across all radii, with average $\langle f_{_{\rm DM}} \rangle \sim 0.85$, while high-mass ($M_{\rm star} &gt; 10^{10.5}\, M_\odot$) systems exhibit relatively low DM fractions in their inner regions ($\langle f_{_{\rm DM}} \rangle \sim 0.47$) which is equivalent to local massive disk galaxies (e.g., Milky Way and Andromeda). This suggests a mass-dependent structural dichotomy, most-likely governed by a combination of internal galactic processes and environmental influences. (2) A tight inverse correlation between $f_{_{\rm DM}}$ and baryon mass surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm bar}$), with intrinsic scatter of $\sim 0.11$ dex. This is consistent with an inside-out baryon assembly scenario and suggests that the fundamental structural correlations of galaxies were already established by $z\sim 0.85$. (3) No significant evolution in $f_{_{\rm DM}}$ with redshift across the MAGPI window, and when combined with higher-redshift ($0.6 \leq z \leq 1.5$) data from Sharma et al. 2025, we quantitatively show that the reported decline in $f_{_{\rm DM}}(z)$ is most-likely due to observational biases against low-mass systems at $z &gt; 1$. These results offer empirical evidence for a scenario in which disk-like galaxies evolve through a co-regulated build-up of baryonic and DM components, preserving internal structural regularities (such as the total mass distribution and rotation-curve shape) throughout cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the First O-Type Bloated Star Candidate through ALMA and EVLA Observations</a><span class="id">[2601.12336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the circumstellar environment of the O-type bloated star candidate IRAS 19520+2759 (I19520) using high-resolution observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Expanded Very Large Array (EVLA). Radio continuum emission traced by the EVLA (C, K, and Q bands) exhibits a spectral index of 0.5, consistent with a thermal jet. ALMA 1.3 mm continuum map reveals a compact source coincident with the optical counterpart of I19520, likely tracing the dense core hosting the central massive young stellar object. A prominent molecular outflow in the east-west direction, along with a possible secondary outflow oriented northeast-southwest, is identified in the $^{13}\mathrm{CO}$ emission. A hot molecular core and a Keplerian disk are detected in several $\mathrm{SO}_2$ transitions.

We show that this loss of precision primarily arises because, at fixed \Oabund, galaxies span a wide dynamic range in ionization parameter and nitrogen enrichment. Here we develop updated indicators that explicitly incorporate both effects via the proxies O32 and N2O2. We define ${\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm R23+\alpha_1 O32+\alpha_2 N2O2$, $\widehat{\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm \widehat{R}+\beta_1 O32+\beta_2 N2O2$, and ${\rm O}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm O3N2+\gamma_1 O32+\gamma_2 N2O2$, and calibrate \Oabund as low-order polynomials in each composite indicator. Applied to a JWST sample with $T_{\rm e}$-method abundances, the updated indicators substantially tighten the correlations with \Oabund, boosting adjusted coefficients of determination from $\mathbb{R}^2\lesssim 0$ (classical indicators) to $\mathbb{R}^2\gtrsim 0.5$ for the full sample and to $\sim 0.7$ at $z&gt;2$. The residuals reveal a redshift evolution in the mapping between \Oabund, strong lines, ionization, and nitrogen enrichment, with a pivotal turning point near the cosmic noon ($z\sim 2$). Our calibrations provide a practical, physically grounded path to precise metallicity measurements in the JWST era and a firmer basis for quantifying early chemical enrichment and feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Not so-dark: High resolution HI imaging of J0139+4328 and identification of an optical counterpart</a><span class="id">[2601.12513]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark galaxies - systems rich in neutral hydrogen (HI) gas but with no stars - are a common prediction of numerous theoretical models and cosmological simulations. However, the unequivocal identification of such sources in current HI surveys has proven challenging. In this work, we present interferometric follow-up observations with the VLA of a former dark galaxy candidate J0139+4328, originally detected with the single-dish FAST telescope. The improved spatial resolution of the VLA data allow us to identify a faint optical counterpart and characterize the galaxy. Located at a distance of about 31 Mpc, J0139+4328 has a stellar mass of 3 x 10^6 M_Sun and a relatively high gas richness of M_HI/M_star = 18. Despite its high ratio, the galaxy is consistent, within the scatter, with the stellar-to-HI mass relation of HI-selected samples in the literature and with the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), although its kinematic measurement is subject to large uncertainties. This case highlights the potential of modern high-sensitivity HI surveys for detecting low surface brightness, gas-rich galaxies, but underscores the need for careful interpretation of low-resolution HI data, with potentially large centroid errors, and for sufficiently deep optical imaging to ensure robust identification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rate of Repeating Tidal Disruption Events with 5–19 years interval constrained by CRTS and ZTF</a><span class="id">[2601.12691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Statistics on tidal disruption events (TDEs) may be contaminated by repeating TDEs (rTDEs), which have been extensively discovered recently. However, the origin of rTDEs remains unclear. In addition, no statistical research on rTDEs with time intervals $&gt;5$ years has been made yet. In this work, we searched for rTDEs with time intervals of 5–19 years using CRTS data in a sample of 16 ZTF BTS TDEs at $z&lt;0.05$. We found 2 rTDE candidates, AT 2019azh and AT 2024pvu, with time intervals of 13.2 and 17.1 years, respectively. The peak luminosities of CRTS flares are close to those of ZTF flares. For the CRTS flare of AT 2024pvu, using GALEX UV observations near the peak, we measured a blackbody temperature of $\sim19500$ K, consistent with TDEs and higher than SNe. Moreover, we estimated the expected number of SNe in the sample to be $\lesssim0.08$, and hence the probability that both CRTS flares are SNe is only 0.3\%. Therefore, the possibility that both CRTS flares are SNe can be ruled out, and it is likely that both are TDEs. Using the two rTDEs, we inferred that the TDE rate is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than the average over 5–19 years prior to TDE detection. Considering another two rTDEs with intervals of $\sim$2 years in the sample and possible rTDEs missed by CRTS, rTDEs with intervals of $&lt;20$ years may account for 25\%–60\% of the TDE sample. We prefer to explain rTDEs as repeating partial TDEs, but the possibility of independent TDEs cannot be ruled out and requires future observational tests.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of Multiple Ultra-Broad-Velocity Molecular Features Associated with the W44 Molecular Cloud</a><span class="id">[2601.12728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of multiple compact molecular features exhibiting extremely broad velocity widths toward the W44 molecular cloud.

These features are interpreted as the result of high-velocity plunges of compact gravitational objects into dense molecular gas. The spatial and kinematic properties of the Petit–Bullets suggest that the plunging material was not a single object but rather a small cluster of compact bodies. A virial mass of $1.0\!\times\! 10^{5}\, M_\odot$ inferred from their velocity dispersion is comparable to that of typical globular clusters. Momentum analysis further implies that the main Bullet likely formed by an isolated black hole.

Accurate determination of BHB merger timescales is essential for interpreting GWBs and constraining key astrophysical quantities such as black hole (BH) occupation fractions and galaxy coalescence rates. High-accuracy $N$-body codes such as \texttt{Griffin} can resolve sub-pc BHB dynamics but are too costly to explore a wide range of initial conditions, motivating the need for surrogate models that emulate their long-term evolution at much lower computational cost. We investigate neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) as surrogates for the secular orbital evolution of BHBs. Our primary contribution is a parameterised NODE (PNODE) trained on an ensemble of $N$-body simulations of galaxy mergers spanning a two-dimensional parameter space defined by the initial orbital eccentricity and particle resolution $(e_i, N)$, with the learned vector field explicitly conditioned on these parameters. A single PNODE thereby learns a simulation-parameter-conditioned dynamical model for the coupled evolution of the BH pair's orbital state across the ensemble, yielding smooth trajectories from which stable hardening and eccentricity growth rates can be extracted. The PNODE accurately reproduces the secular evolution of the specific orbital energy and angular momentum, and the corresponding Keplerian orbital elements, for held-out trajectories, with modest generalisation to a partially unseen high-resolution case. Combining PNODE predictions with semi-analytical prescriptions for stellar hardening and gravitational-wave emission yields BHB merger timescales consistent with those obtained from direct $N$-body inputs within current theoretical uncertainties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The long-term evolution of Ultra Faint Dwarf Galaxies and observational implications</a><span class="id">[2601.13049]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. In the Local Group, dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) exhibit large velocity dispersions. These values are generally attributed to the presence of substantial amounts of dark matter (DM), in line with the predictions of the standard model of galaxy formation. However, alternative, more conservative explanations exist, such as non-virialized dynamical states induced by tidal interactions, the presence of stellar streams, and artificial inflation of the velocity dispersion caused by binary-star orbital motion. Aims. We study the dynamical evolution of UFDs using purely stellar (&quot;dry&quot;) dynamics, without invoking DM. We dynamically evolve our systems up to a Hubble time and compare our results with observational studies and previous theoretical work. Methods. We employ direct high precision NBODY simulations performed with the NBODY6++GPU code. We explore the role of binaries in inflating the velocity dispersion of low-mass host galaxies. We also present both the stellar and dynamical evolution of the stellar population, which is necessary to properly interpret our results. Results. We find that, in all our models, the UFD remains globally quasi-stationary for approximately 3000 Myr. Subsequently, the system undergoes mass segregation and experiences a phase resembling core collapse. Red giants and white dwarfs (WD) are found to play significant, but distinct, roles. Red giants provide the dominant contribution to the luminosity, whereas WDs constitute the largest fraction of the non-luminous component, accounting for approximately 13% of the total stellar population. Finally, if not taken into account properly, velocity dispersion measurements can be strongly biased by the presence of a significant binary population, which can lead to substantial overestimates of velocity dispersion in UFDs</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope: Early Data Release of observations in the 1.4 μm water-vapor-absorption band</a><span class="id">[2601.13068]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ground-based observations around 1.4 $\mu$m are normally limited by strong absorption of telluric water-vapor. However, Dome A, Antarctica has exceptionally dry conditions that offer a unique opportunity for observations in this band. We designed a new filter covering 1.34–1.48 $\mu$m, namely $W'$, and installed it on the Antarctic Infrared Binocular Telescope (AIRBT) at Dome A in 2025. AIRBT comprises two identical 15 cm optical tube assemblies and two InGaAs cameras equipped with $J$ and $W'$ filters, respectively. With this Early Data Release (EDR), we aim to evaluate the performance of the $W'$ band at Dome A to observe objects with water-vapor features. This EDR covers $\thicksim 20 \ \mathrm{deg^2}$ in the Galactic plane using $\thicksim 20,000$ images in three nights. For 2 s exposures, the 5 $\sigma$ limiting magnitude histogram peaks at $J \thicksim 11.5$ mag (Vega) and $W' \thicksim 9.9$ mag, respectively. The $J-W'$ vs $J-H$ color-color diagram distinguishes ultracool candidates with water-vapor-absorption features from reddened early type stars. Furthermore, later-type stars tend to exhibit stronger water-vapor absorption. Some sources show larger $\Delta W'$ than $\Delta J$ across the three nights, which we attribute to variations of their water-vapor-absorption depth. We conclude that it will be efficient to search for ultracool stars and estimate their spectral subtypes using $W'$ band imaging at Dome A, where the atmospheric transmission is high and stable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating radio emission from flickering AGN jets: travelling shocks and hotspot brightening</a><span class="id">[2601.13138]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of flickering variability in jet power on the luminosity and morphology of radio galaxies. We use a Lagrangian particle method together with relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the PLUTO code to track the evolution of electron spectra through particle acceleration at shocks and cooling processes. We introduce an adapted version of this method which improves tracking of adiabatic cooling in regimes where low density jet material mixes with high density from the ambient medium in the lobes. We find that rapid increases in jet power can lead to large increases in hotspot luminosity due to the interaction of a travelling shock structure with the pre-existing shock structure at the jet head. We show that in some cases it may be possible to identify a bright region of emission corresponding to a shock travelling along the jet axis. We find that the time-averaged radiative efficiency of variable jets is similar to their steady counterparts, but find significant departures from this on an instantaneous basis. We suggest that, together with environmental effects and differences in the average powers of jets, variable jet powers may have a significant impact on how we understand the diversity of radio jets seen in observations and have significant implications for interpretations of jet powers, energy budgets and luminosity-linear size diagrams.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MARVEL Analysis of the Measured High-resolution Spectra of CO Isotopologues</a><span class="id">[2601.13141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Carbon monoxide is thought to be the second most abundant molecule in the Universe.

A previous study suggested that high-resolution imaging could break this degeneracy through differences in the lens-source relative proper motion. In this work, we identify a new planetary model for this event that arises from a newly identified degeneracy, simultaneously reproducing the observed light curve and remaining consistent with the relative proper motion measured from high-resolution imaging. By combining constraints from the light-curve modeling and high-resolution observations, we infer a lens system consisting of a $\sim 1~M_{\odot}$ host star orbited by a $\sim 1.5~M_{\rm Jup}$ planet, with a projected separation of about 2 or 8 au, subject to the “Close/Wide” degeneracy. Our reanalysis of the color-magnitude diagram further indicates that the source star has unresolved companions that contribute non-negligible blended light, highlighting the importance of carefully accounting for source and lens companions in future Roman microlensing analyses. Finally, we show that adopting a single mass–luminosity relation significantly underestimates the uncertainties in the inferred lens properties for host masses $\gtrsim 1~M_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Physical Parameter Constraining Power of HCN and HNC with Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2601.13305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We quantify the utility of HCN and HNC to characterize gas conditions in the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253.

Using different subsets of the eight total HCN and HNC transitions measured by ALCHEMI, we test the number and combinations of transitions necessary for constraining the temperature, H$_2$ volume and column densities, cosmic-ray ionization rate, and beam-filling factor in three representative regions within NGC 253. We use these combinations of HCN and HNC transitions to constrain chemical and radiative transfer models and infer the gas conditions using a Bayesian nested sampling algorithm combined with neural network models for increased efficiency. By comparing the shapes of the resulting posterior distributions, as well as the medians and uncertainties for each gas parameter, from each test case to what we obtain with the full set of eight transitions (the control), we quantify how well each test reproduces the control. We find that multiple transitions each of both molecules are required to obtain a median parameter value within a factor of 2 of the control with an uncertainty less than 2-3 times that of the control. We also find that transition combinations that feature a range of upper-state energies are most effective. We show that single transitions, such as HCN J = 1-0 or 3-2, are among the worst-performing combinations and result in parameter values up to an order of magnitude different than the control.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy transformation across the cosmic web: The influence zone of filaments</a><span class="id">[2601.13309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The matter distribution in the Universe exhibits a rich variety of structures forming the cosmic web. These structures arise from the anisotropic gravitational collapse of primordial density fluctuations and define the pathways along which galaxies flow from voids to high-density clusters. Local density variations within these structures play a fundamental role in driving the environmental evolution of galaxies. To characterise filament boundaries, we analysed galaxy overdensity profiles around filaments in two redshift ranges: $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$ and $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$. Perpendicular and parallel profiles were derived by averaging galaxy overdensity as a function of distance. Characteristic scales and central overdensities were then analysed by fitting analytical models, specifically exponential and power-law families. We also introduced normalised density profiles to account for survey incompleteness. The perpendicular overdensity profiles show a nearly constant value in the central regions $D_{fila} &lt; 1$ Mpc, decreasing at distances up to $\approx 10$ Mpc. The mean physical widths (scale radii) at $0.05 &lt; z &lt; 0.1$ and $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3$ are $2.39 \pm 0.69$ and $5.56 \pm 2.29$ Mpc, respectively. This scale difference between redshift ranges is also evident in the normalised profiles. Conversely, profiles along filaments remain constant at distances larger than $\approx 20$ Mpc from the nearest intersection. Our results show that the influence zone of cosmic filaments extends up to $\sim 10$ Mpc from their spines. Furthermore, a mild evolution in structural parameters is observed over the past $\sim 4$ Gyr, suggesting that filaments undergo measurable changes even at relatively low redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DESIRED temperature-metallicity relations in star-forming regions: probing the Galactic radial and azimuthal metallicity distributions</a><span class="id">[2601.13337]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse a sample of 225 star-forming regions from the DESIRED-E project, each with simultaneous determinations of the electron temperature from ionized nitrogen and oxygen, $T_{\rm e}$([NII]) and $T_{\rm e}$([OIII]), respectively. We derive new empirical relations connecting the gas-phase metallicity to the global electron temperature, $T_{\rm e}$(H$^+$), as determined via radio observations. We establish two calibrations: one assuming a homogeneous temperature distribution ($t^2 = 0$, the “direct method”), and another accounting for internal temperature fluctuations ($t^2 &gt; 0$). Applying these calibrations to 460 radio observations of Galactic HII regions spanning Galactocentric distances from $\sim0.1$ to 16 kpc, we determine the radial O/H gradient in the Milky Way under both assumptions. We further compare these nebular gradients to independent metallicity estimates from young O- and B-type stars and Cepheid variables. We find that the $t^2 &gt; 0$ calibration yields a gradient in excellent agreement with stellar-based determinations, whereas the $t^2 = 0$ method underestimates metallicities by up to $\sim$0.3 dex. This discrepancy cannot be reconciled by invoking oxygen depletion onto dust grains or nucleosynthetic processing via the CNO cycle in massive stars. We also find that one widely used relation in the literature, assuming $t^2 = 0$, produces an excessively steep gradient – likely due to the use of outdated atomic data and pre-CCD observations. Finally, we explore potential azimuthal variations in the Galactic metallicity distribution driven by the presence of the spiral arms, finding no evidence for variations larger than $\sim$0.1 dex with respect to the general radial gradient.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13375" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environment and Gas Fraction in Type-2 AGN versus Non-AGN Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.13375]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the environmental parameters and gas fraction (f$_{gas}$) properties of type 2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies, utilizing a large sample of galaxies from SDSS DR7 with z $\le$ 0.3. We find that the environment affects type 2 AGN and non-AGN galaxies in similar ways and does not impact the strength of AGN-driven outflows. The f$_{gas}$ of type 2 AGN and non-AGN host galaxies show no variation between group and isolated environments, suggesting that host galaxy gas content is largely independent of large-scale environment. We find that type 2 AGN host galaxies possess systematically lower f$_{gas}$ than their non-AGN counterparts when matched in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). This suggests that AGN activity plays a significant role in regulating the molecular gas reservoir and, consequently, the star formation processes within galaxies. We find that Type 2 AGNs exhibiting strong outflows are associated with higher gas fractions, higher star-formation rates, and younger stellar populations than those with weak or no outflows. This may indicate either concurrent star formation in gas-rich systems hosting powerful outflows, or a time delay between AGN activity and its effect on star formation consistent with a delayed AGN feedback scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the kinematics of the Local Group with chemically enriched gas in the Hestia simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.13382]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of the gas kinematics within the Hestia project, a state-of-the-art set of simulations of the Local Group, with a particular focus on the velocity patterns of different ions and the large-scale motion of gas and galaxies towards the Local Group barycentre. Using two high-resolution Hestia runs, we examine the distribution and velocities of H I, C IV, Si III, O VI, O VII, and O VIII and their imprints on sightlines observed from the Sun's location in different reference frames. To mimic observational strategies, we assess the contribution of rotating disc gas, assuming simple kinematic and geometrical considerations. Our results indicate that local absorption features in observed sightlines most likely trace material in the circumgalactic medium of the Milky Way. Some sightlines, however, show that intragroup material could be more easily observed towards the barycentre, which defines a preferred direction in the sky. In particular, H I, Si III, and C IV roughly trace cold gas inside the Milky Way and Andromeda haloes, as most of their mass flux occurs within the virial region of each galaxy, while oxygen high ions mostly trace hot halo and intragroup gas, with comparable mass fluxes in the Local Group outskirts and the circumgalactic medium of the two main galaxies. Additionally, we find that pressures traced by different ionic species outside the Milky Way halo show systematically higher values towards the barycentre direction in contrast to its antipode in the sky. Kinematic imprints of the global motion towards the barycentre can be seen at larger distances for all ionic species as the Milky Way rams into material in the direction of Andromeda, with gas towards the anti-barycentre lagging behind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13403" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey: A new three-ringed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</a><span class="id">[2601.13403]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the detection of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene (c-C11H8) in TMC-1 with the QUI- JOTE line survey.

The identification of this new PAH was based on the agreement between the rotational parameters derived from the analysis of the lines and those obtained by quantum chemical calculations. The column density derived for 1H-cyclopent[cd]indene is (6.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2, with a rotational temperature of 9 K. Its abundance is high, as is that of the rest of the PAHs, but it is the lowest of all those detected to date in TMC-1, being 2.66 times less abundant than indene and 4.66 times less than phenalene. This result will help us to better understand the growth of five- and six-membered rings in dark clouds. Chemical models explaining their formation through the bottom-up model are still very incomplete and require further experimental and theoretical effort. Even so, the most likely formation reactions would occur between the smallest rings with small hydrocarbons; the most probable reaction for the formation of cyclopentindene is that between indene and C2H, C2H3, and/or their cation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass density structuring around galaxy formation sites: impact on galaxy basic properties</a><span class="id">[2601.13431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the local evolution of the Universe around galaxy formation sites in the EAGLE50 large-volume reference simulation. Using the reduced inertia tensor (r-TOI), we followed the anisotropic evolution of initially spherical Lagrangian volumes (LVs) centred at galaxy formation sites, both in dark matter (DM) and in cold baryons (CB), from very high redshift $z=15$ onward. We describe LV deformation in terms of the r-TOI eigen-directions, principal axes, their derived shape parameters, and the timescales for the freezing-out of these principal directions and axes. Of particular interest are the age of the Universe, $t_{\rm U}$, when the local Cosmic Web (CW) spine emerges, and that when anisotropic DM mass arrangements (i.e., migrant mass flows) cease. We find that the shapes LVs acquire along their evolution affect the halo and stellar mass of their central galaxy: prolate-shaped LVs show a tendency to host low-mass galaxies at $z=0$, while massive galaxies tend to form within triaxial or oblate LVs. Also, the local CW spine tends to set in earlier on in LVs that are to host massive galaxies than in those harbouring less massive galaxies. In addition, anisotropic DM-mass rearrangements stop late on average, at $t_{\rm U}\sim 10.5\,$Gyr, and even slightly later for CB. Interestingly, $z=0$ LVs with either flattened configurations in CB or those that are highly prolate in DM, are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies. This effect increases from $z=1$ to $z=0$. Finally, the CB spine of LVs that are more likely to host rotation-dominated galaxies emerges at later times.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Four Cold Super-Jupiters Revealed by Extended and Complex Microlensing Signals</a><span class="id">[2601.13450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the analysis of four microlensing events, KMT-2020-BLG-0202, KMT-2022-BLG-1551, KMT-2023-BLG-0466, and KMT-2025-BLG-0121, which exhibit extended and complex anomalies in their light curves. These events were identified through a systematic reanalysis of KMTNet data aimed at detecting planetary signals that deviate from the typical short-term anomaly morphology. Detailed modeling indicates that all four anomalies were produced by planetary companions to low-mass stellar hosts. The events have mass ratios of $q \sim (5$–$14)\times10^{-3}$ and Einstein timescales of $t_{\rm E} \sim 20$–$43$ days. Bayesian analyses based on Galactic models show that the companions are super-Jupiters with masses of a few to approximately 10 $M_{\rm J}$, orbiting sub-solar-mass hosts located at distances of $D_{\rm L} \sim 4$–$7$ kpc. All planets lie well beyond the snow line of their hosts, placing them in the regime of cold giant planets. These detections demonstrate that extended and complex microlensing anomalies, which are often challenging to recognize as planetary in origin, can nonetheless contain planetary signals.

The VGT analysis is performed using four molecular tracers: DCN (3-2), C18O (2-1), HN13C (3-2), and H13CO+ (3-2) - which probe gas across different density regimes, observed with the ALMA 12 m array. Owing to its sensitivity to gas dynamics, a comparison between VGT and dust polarization provides a powerful probe of the evolutionary processes in massive star-forming regions. From our analysis we reveal a complex magnetic-field structure, shaped by the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. In addition, it also appears that there is a large-scale (beyond the core scale) gravitational infall from the surrounding medium on to the filament and the central densest region. Furthermore, we observe that cores are dominated by a mix of turbulence and gravity.

The median D/H ratio in Perseus appears lower than values reported for Taurus and Chamaeleon, while the D2/D ratio agrees with Taurus within uncertainties. A positive correlation between D/H and n(H2) supports the use of D/H as an evolutionary tracer. D2/D does not correlate with n(H2), but shows a positive correlation with T_{kin}, suggesting that its formation is influenced by a mildly endothermic pathway.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Structure of an 80 pc Long Massive Filament</a><span class="id">[2601.13616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using new Institut de Radioastronomie Millimétrique (IRAM) 30m telescope $\rm N_2H^+$, $\rm C^{18}O$ $J$=1-0 and Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope $\rm ^{13}CO$ and $\rm C^{18}O$ $J$=2-1 maps together with archival far-infrared continuum data, and $\rm ^{12}CO$, and $\rm ^{13}CO$ $J$=1-0 data, we present a comprehensive analysis of the massive filament CFG024.00$+$0.48 (G24) across clump-to-cloud scales. Our results show that G24 is an $\sim$80 pc giant filament with a total mass of $\sim$$10^5$ M$_{\odot}$. In the different tracers the filament width is measured to be about $\sim$2 times the beam size of the observations, as expected for power-law density distributions, giving beam-deconvolved widths in the range from 0.8 to 2.8 pc. We determine a line-of-sight thickness of $\sim$2.2 pc demonstrating that G24 is not an edge-on, flatten structure. The virial parameter obtained from line mass ($\alpha_{\rm line,vir}=M_{\rm line,vir}/M_{\rm line}$) from the $\rm C^{18}O$ (1-0) data is 0.85, and that obtained from $Herschel$-based H$_2$ column density is 0.52, suggesting G24 is globally close to virial equilibrium. The distribution of the 40 dust clumps appears to have a ”two-tier” fragmentation pattern. For the clump groups, the separation, with a mean/median of 3.68/3.46 pc, is very close to expected length associated with the maximum fragmentation growth rate of $\lambda_{\rm max}=3.55 \pm0.32$ pc estimated for the dust. However, the longitudinal centroid velocity profiles of $\rm C^{18}O$ and $\rm N_2H^+$ show oscillation patterns with wavelengths of 9.8$\pm$0.1 pc and 9.9$\pm$0.1 pc, respectively. This is $\sim$2 times larger than the corresponding values of $\lambda_{\rm max}$ of 4.96$\pm$0.63 pc and 4.65$\pm$1.34 pc, respectively. This suggests that the velocity structure is not dominated by flows directly associated with the fragmentation seen in the dust emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible time-variable iron-K$α$ emission in the circum-nuclear region of the Circinus galaxy</a><span class="id">[2601.13660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present imaging and spatially resolved spectral analyses of eight Chandra data taken for the Circinus galaxy in $\approx$ 22 years to reveal neutral iron-K$\alpha$ emission on a circumnuclear scale ($\sim$ 10–100 pc) and search for time variability in the emission. By simulating and taking account of point-source emission from the active galactic nucleus (AGN), we detect iron-line emission $\sim$ 20–60 pc away from the nucleus, particularly in the eastern and western regions. In the two regions, possible time variability in the line flux was also detected. Our spectral analysis then finds that the observed equivalent widths can reach $\sim$ 2 keV and the slopes of underlying continua are rather inverted with $\Gamma &lt; 0$. These are consistent with a scenario in which the iron emission originates from clouds illuminated by AGN X-rays; our result could provide the first extragalactic example of AGN X-ray echoes. In this scenario, we estimated the physical sizes of the illuminated clouds based on the timescale of variability to be less than 6 pc. Furthermore, we compared the iron emission distribution with the cold molecular distribution inferred by Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observation of CO($J$=3–2), revealing that in the region of bright iron-line emission, the molecular emission seems to be weak. This might suggest that the AGN X-ray emission affects the chemical composition in the form of AGN feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XPE and VLT /FORS2 polarimetry challenge the Seyfert-1.9 classification of MCG-05-23-16</a><span class="id">[2601.13701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the third observation of the Seyfert-1.9 active galactic nucleus (AGN) MCG-05-23-16 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (\textit{IXPE}), together with optical spectro-polarimetry obtained at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), and combined with archival near-ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared polarimetric data. No X-ray polarization was detected in the 2-8 keV band, with a 99\% confidence upper limit of $\leq$2.9\%, further reduced to $\leq$2.5\% when combined with the two past IXPE observations of the same target. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that equatorial coronal models are disfavored if the AGN is indeed a type-1.9/2 AGN, but coronae coplanar to the accretion disk remain consistent if the source is less inclined than previously assumed. \textit{VLT}/FORS2 data reveal a typical type-2 spectrum in total flux, a broad H$\alpha$ line in polarized flux, and strongly wavelength dependent polarization degree and angle, rotating by nearly 70$^\circ$ across the optical band. Comparison with historical measurements confirms long-term stability of the polarization spectrum and a $\sim$90$^\circ$ rotation in the near-ultraviolet. Interpreting the multi-wavelength polarization relative to the AGN ionization axis indicates that the main obscurer is not a compact circumnuclear torus, but a distant kpc-scale dust lane crossing the galaxy. This result implies that MCG-05-23-16 is in fact a type-1 AGN seen through foreground dust. The low X-ray column density becomes consistent with the absence of polarization, provided that the nuclear inclination is low.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A jet-gas interaction beyond the host galaxy: detection of a neutral hydrogen outflow at cosmic noon</a><span class="id">[2601.13728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) observations of 0731+438, an \mbox{FR II} radio galaxy at a redshift of 2.429 with two lobes separated by 82 kpc.

The outflow has a mass outflow rate of $\sim\,0.4T_{\rm s}\Omega\rm\, M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, which could increase to $\sim\,4.0T_{\rm s}\Omega\rm\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, corresponding to an energy outflow rate of $2.4T_{\rm s}\Omega\times10^{40}$ – $1.5T_{\rm s}\Omega\times10^{41}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$, where $T_{\rm s}$ is the spin temperature and $\Omega$ is the solid angle of the outflow. Previous optical observations identified an extended emission line region aligned with the radio axis, ionized by the central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). Within this region, a warm and ionized outflow with a mass outflow rate of $\sim\,50\rm\, M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and an energy outflow rate of $\sim1.7\times10^{43}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$ was detected. We propose that both the extended emission line region and the optical outflow are results of synergistic effect between jet and AGN radiation. The AGN likely exerts negative feedback on the host galaxy, as evidenced by the gas expulsion by the jet and the high velocity dispersion of ionized gas observed optically. So far, detections of jet-driven neutral hydrogen outflows remain rare. The high redshift, large outflow radii, substantial mass outflow rate and energy outflow rate of the neutral hydrogen outflow in 0731+438 expand the known parameter space of such outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIRIUS: Dark matter cusp evolution in dense dwarf galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.13765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dwarf galaxies have a wide variety of structures, such as dark matter (DM) distribution, stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and stellar density.

In this study, we performed cosmological $N$-body/smoothed-particle hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of dwarf galaxies with the highest gas and DM particle mass resolutions of 2.37 $M_{\odot}$ and 12.8 $M_{\odot}$, respectively. The stellar-to-DM halo mass ratio of one of our simulated dwarf galaxies was $\sim 10^{-4}$, typical for satellites of the Milky Way. The stellar mass ($10^5 M_{\odot}$) and half-mass radius (68 pc) were also similar to those of the satellites of the Milky Way. The power-law slope of the DM halo was $\alpha = -1.1$. On the other hand, the other simulated galaxy exhibited a stellar-to-halo mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-3}$ and a steeper power-law slope ($\alpha=-1.9$) than the other; the presence of baryonic matter deepened the cusp.

We update an analytical cusp-core transition model by incorporating the effect of supernova-driven mass loss. Adapting this model to SPARC galaxies, we measure the energy conversion efficiency epsilon, defined as the fraction of supernova feedback energy that is used to change the central dark-matter potential. We find epsilon   0.01 for nearby SPARC galaxies. Building on these measurements, we compare the dynamical energy required for a cusp-core transformation with the feedback energy available over burst cycles and identify a cusp-core transition forbidden region on the halo-stellar mass plane where transformation cannot occur. Galaxies with halo masses from 10^8 to 10^11 M_sun lie outside the forbidden region, whereas ultra-faint dwarf galaxies &lt; 10^8 M_sun, galaxy groups and clusters &gt; 10^11 M_sun fall within it, consistent with their high central densities and the inefficiency of core formation at very low and very high masses. This approach also explains the observed diversity of inner density profiles in low-mass systems, showing that both the star formation rate and the energy conversion efficiency govern them, with the latter emerging as a key parameter setting the strength of the cusp-core transition. Beyond the cusp-core problem, our observationally inferred energy conversion efficiency provides a model independent benchmark that strongly constrains galaxy formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boxy/Peanut Bulges: Comparative Analysis of EGIPS Galaxies and TNG50 Models</a><span class="id">[2601.13893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated the properties of boxy/peanut-shaped (B/PS) bulges in a sample of 71 galaxies from the Edge-on Galaxies in the Pan-STARRS Survey (EGIPS) and 20 simulated galaxies from Illustris TNG50 using multicomponent photometric decomposition. For each real and simulated galaxy, we obtained a suitable photometric model in which the B/PS bulge was represented by a dedicated 2D photometric function. For real galaxies, we found that more flattened X-structures are generally residing in larger B/PS bulges. When tested against the galaxy masses, we verified that both larger bulges and more flattened X-structures are typically found in more massive galaxies. Since large bars are also known to reside in more massive galaxies, we conclude that the flatness of X-structures in larger B/PS bulges has a physical origin, rather than being solely a result of projection effects due to differences in observed bar viewing angles. When comparing the properties of B/PS bulges between EGIPS galaxies and TNG50 galaxies, with bars rotated for different viewing angles, we found that B/PS bulges in TNG50 are considerably smaller and less luminous in terms of total intensity. This is consistent with previous studies of bar properties in TNG50, indicating the B/PS bulges in TNG50 differ from those in real galaxies, as do their parent bars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Frequency shift and viewing direction variations in gravitational lensing</a><span class="id">[2601.13912]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a gravitational lensing system, the relative transverse velocities of the lens, source, and observer induce a frequency shift in the observed radiation.

This paper provides a rigorous theoretical treatment of the effect, deriving general expressions for the frequency shift within a lensing system embedded in a cosmological spacetime. Our formulation remains valid for arbitrary distances and velocities - including highly relativistic regimes - under any Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker metric. Expanding upon previous papers on moving lenses, we provide a detailed analysis of frequency effects induced by lenses moving at relativistic speeds. Furthermore, we extend standard lensing theory by deriving an exact formula for the variation in the source's viewing direction. This result is of interest for strongly anisotropic emitters, such as compact binary systems emitting gravitational waves. Finally, we quantify the apparent misalignment between the lens and the source's two images produced by time-delay effects in lens systems moving with high velocity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing AGN duty cycle and cluster-driven morphology in a giant episodic radio galaxy</a><span class="id">[2601.14219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution of radio jet morphology and its energetics is significantly influenced by the environment in which the host galaxy resides. As giant radio galaxies (GRGs) often extend to the scale of entire galaxy clusters ($\sim$Mpc) and beyond, they are a suitable class of objects for studying jet–intracluster medium interactions. This paper presents a multiwavelength study of a GRG, J1007+3540, using the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey second data release (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) at 400 MHz. The source has a projected linear extension of 1.45 Mpc and is hosted by MaxBCG J151.77665+35.67813, within the WHL 100706.4+354041 cluster. At both frequencies, the source exhibits clear signatures of recurrent jet activity, a one-sided, extended, tail-like diffuse structure with a morphological break in the tail. The estimated radiative ages of the inner lobes and outer north lobe are $\sim$140 Myr and $\sim$240 Myr, respectively. In addition to the radio analysis, we performed optical–to–infrared spectral energy distribution modelling. The host galaxy is an evolved elliptical system with a stellar mass of $\log_{10}(M_\star/M_\odot) = 11.0$ and an old stellar population age of $\sim$12 Gyr. The high infrared-derived star formation rate ($\sim106~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) of the source implies significant dust-obscured star formation, potentially linked to merger-driven gas inflows. J1007+3540 presents a rare combination of a restarted jet, a detached tail-like structure, and unusual spectral flattening beyond the tail break, which is very rare to report together in a GRG. This rare and remarkable system offers a unique laboratory for probing the interplay between active galactic nucleus activity, star formation, and environmental effects in cluster-surrounded GRGs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Quenched and Relatively Isolated Dwarf Galaxy in the Local Volume</a><span class="id">[2601.14248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An increasing number of discoveries of isolated and quenched dwarf galaxies are challenging the idea that the present-day local environment of low-mass systems is the main determinant of their quenching.

CVn C is a low-mass (3.4(+4.2-2.6)*10^6 M_sun) galaxy with a Tip of the Red Giant Branch distance of 8.43(+0.47-0.32) Mpc determined from the resolved stars in the HST imaging, which we also use to derive CVn C's structural parameters. CVn C's distance places CVn C in the Local Volume and in an isolated environment with the most tidally influential L* galaxy &gt; 5Rvir away. Additional constraints from the HST color-magnitude diagram, archival Far-Ultraviolet (FUV), and neutral hydrogen (HI) data show that CVn C is quenched, with no evidence of star formation in the last 100 Myr and no detectable gas (MHI &lt; 1.5*10^6 M_sun). Circumstantial evidence suggests that CVn C may have quenched via past interactions with the L* galaxy NGC 4631 (L_K = 10^10.4 L_sun), and was possibly sent on an extreme backsplash orbit by the tidal dissolution of a subhalo group. However, other quenching mechanisms-such as stripping via the cosmic web-cannot be ruled out. CVn C adds to the growing number of quenched dwarf galaxies in under-dense environments, a population that will be critical to defining the mass and environment regimes in which different quenching mechanisms operate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anisotropic Collective Excitations of Bose Gases in Modified Newtonian Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2601.12848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Collective excitations are fundamental in quantum many-body physics, yet their spectra have traditionally been studied within Newtonian dynamics.

With deep multi-band NIRCam images in GOODS-South from JADES, we measure the effective radii ($R_e$) of the galaxies at rest-frame 0.3, 0.5 and 1$\mu m$. On average, QGs are 45% (15%) more compact at rest-frame 1$\mu m$ than they are at 0.3$\mu m$ (0.5$\mu m$). Regardless of wavelengths, the $R_e$ of QGs strongly evolves with redshift, and this evolution depends on stellar mass. For lower-mass QGs with $M_*=10^{10}-10^{10.6}M_\odot$, the evolution follows $R_e\sim(1+z)^{-1.1}$, whereas it becomes steeper, following $R_e\sim(1+z)^{-1.7}$, for higher-mass QGs with $M_*&gt;10^{10.6}M_\odot$. To constrain the physical mechanisms driving the apparent size evolution, we study the relationship between $R_e$ and the formation redshift ($z_{form}$) of QGs. For lower-mass QGs, this relationship is broadly consistent with $R_e\sim(1+z_{form})^{-1}$, in line with the expectation of the progenitor effect. For higher-mass QGs, the relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ depends on stellar age. Older QGs have a steeper relationship between $R_e$ and $z_{form}$ than that expected from the progenitor effect alone, suggesting that mergers and/or post-quenching continuous gas accretion drive additional size growth in very massive systems. We find that the $z&gt;3$ QGs in our sample are very compact, with mass surface densities $\Sigma_e\gtrsim10^{10} M_\odot/\rm{kpc}^2$, and their $R_e$ are possibly even smaller than anticipated from the size evolution measured for lower-redshift QGs. Finally, we take a close look at the structure of GS-9209, one of the earliest confirmed massive QGs at $z_{spec}\sim4.7$. From UV to NIR, GS-9209 becomes increasingly compact, and its light profile becomes more spheroidal, showing that the color gradient is already present in this earliest massive QG.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo Spin Depends on The Distance to Large-scale Filament</a><span class="id">[2411.11443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We employ a semi-analytical methodology to estimate the dark matter halo spin of HI gas-rich galaxies in the Arecibo Legacy Fast Alfa Survey and investigate the relationship between halo spin and the proximity of galaxies to large-scale filaments.

Employing a sink-particle module, we self-consistently resolve star formation and feedback, avoiding reliance on simplified models. We investigate the effects of stellar feedback mechanisms, gas return from star-forming clouds, and disk mass on the starburst and outflow. Our simulations generate a starburst lasting $\sim25$ Myr, peaking at 20-50 $\rm{M_{\odot},yr^{-1}}$, although the total stellar mass often exceeds M82's estimated value. The outflow develops in two stages: initially, continuous SNe form small bubbles that merge into a superbubble containing warm/hot gas and intermediate- to high-density cool filaments. After $\sim10$ Myr, the superbubble breaks out of the disk, and within $\sim15$ Myr a kpc-scale outflow forms. Cool filaments survive stellar feedback, become entrained in the wind, and stretch to hundreds of parsecs. Transport from the cool ISM is the dominant net contributor to the total mass of the cool phase in the outflow, whereas transfers from hotter phases, such as through condensation or precipitation, provide only a minor net contribution, likely offset by simultaneous transfer from the cool phase back to hotter phases. While the mass loading factor is comparable to M82, the cool gas outflow rate and velocity are lower, with velocities $\sim60\%$ below observed values; warm and hot gas are $\sim25\%$ slower. SN feedback is the primary driver, and gas return significantly influences the starburst and outflow, while other factors are secondary. Stronger clustered SN feedback is likely required to better match observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08870" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization Are All Bark and No Bite – Plenty of Ionizing Photons, Low Escape Fractions</a><span class="id">[2505.08870]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early results from JWST suggest that epoch-of-reionization (EoR) galaxies produce copious ionizing photons, which, if they escape efficiently, could cause reionization to occur too early. We study this problem using \jwst\ imaging and prism spectroscopy for 412 galaxies at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 9.0. We fit these data simultaneously with stellar-population and nebular-emission models that include a parameter for the fraction of ionizing photons that escape the galaxy, $f_\mathrm{esc}$. We find that the ionization production efficiency, $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ = Q(H) / L(UV), increases with redshift and decreasing UV luminosity, but shows significant scatter, $\sigma( \log \xi_\mathrm{ion})$ = 0.3 dex. The inferred escape fractions averaged over the population are low, ranging from $\langle f_\mathrm{esc} \rangle$ = $2.6\pm 1.4$\% at 6 &lt; z &lt; 9 to $6.5\pm 2.2$\% at 4.5 &lt; z &lt; 6 with weak or no indication of evolution with redshift. This implies that in our models most of the ionizing photons need to be absorbed to account for the nebular emission. We compute the impact of our results on reionization, including the distributions for $\xi_\mathrm{ion}$ and $f_\mathrm{esc}$, and the evolution and uncertainty of the UV luminosity function. Considering galaxies brighter than M(UV) &lt; -16 mag, we would produce an IGM hydrogen-ionized fraction of $x_e = 0.5$ at 5.3 &lt; z &lt; 5.8, possibly too late compared to constraints from from QSO sightlines. Including fainter galaxies, M(UV) &lt; -14 mag, we obtain $x_e = 0.5$ at 6.0 &lt; z &lt; 8.1, fully consistent with QSO and CMB data. This implies that EoR galaxies produce plenty of ionizing photons, but these do not efficiently escape. This may be a result of high gas column densities combined with burstier star-formation histories, which limit the time massive stars are able to clear channels through the gas for ionizing photons to escape.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A black hole in a near-pristine galaxy 700 million years after the Big Bang</a><span class="id">[2505.22567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent discovery of a large number of massive black holes within the first two billion years after the Big Bang, as well as their peculiar properties, have been largely unexpected based on the extrapolation of the properties of luminous quasars. These findings have prompted the development of several theoretical models for the early formation and growth of black holes, which are, however, difficult to differentiate. We report the metallicity measurement around a gravitationally lensed massive black hole at redshift 7.04 (classified as a Little Red Dot), hosted in a galaxy with very low dynamical mass. The weakness of the [OIII]5007 emission line relative to the narrow H$\beta$ emission indicates extremely low metallicity, about $4\times 10^{-3}$ solar, and even more metal poor in the surrounding few 100 pc. We argue that such properties cannot be uncommon among accreting black holes around this early cosmic epoch. Explaining such a low chemical enrichment in a system that has developed a massive black hole is challenging for most theories. Models assuming heavy black hole seeds (such as Direct Collapse Black Holes) or super-Eddington accretion scenarios struggle to explain the observations, although they can potentially reproduce the observed properties in some cases. Models invoking &quot;primordial black holes&quot; (i.e. putative black holes formed shortly after the Big Bang) may potentially explain the low chemical enrichment associated with this black hole, although this class of models also requires further developments for proper testing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shape Shifting Light Dark Matter Solitons</a><span class="id">[2506.01282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter consisting of a Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultra-light particles is predicted to have a soliton shape that shifts with the dark matter mass fraction in galaxies containing a centrally localized point mass (or black hole), consistent with previous numerical results and analytical approximations in both the cored self-gravitating and cusped hydrogenic limits. Solutions of the Schrödinger-Poisson equation with baryonic coupling are here accurately represented as a sum of five Gaussians with numerically optimized amplitudes and widths, thereby facilitating galactic predictions and observational comparisons as a function of dark matter mass fraction. The results are used to derive mass, energy and velocity scaling relations as functions of soliton mass fraction, as well as to predict dark matter halo size, mass and core density in terms of observed half-light radii and velocity dispersions by invoking observationally validated approximations relating rotational velocity and velocity dispersion. Applications of the predictions, as well as challenges associated with critically testing dark matter models, are illustrated using comparisons with dwarf spheroidal (dSph) and ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy observations, which, under the present soliton-based modeling assumptions, are found to be compatible with soliton particle masses of the order of $10^{-22}$ (eV/c$^2$), with an upper bound of approximately $3\times 10^{-22}$ (eV/c$^2$). Implications of the results are discussed, including speculations regarding the role of dark matter evaporation in galactic evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REBELS-MOSFIRE: Weak CIII] Emission is Typical Among Extremely UV-bright, Massive Galaxies at $z\sim7$</a><span class="id">[2506.21674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Keck/MOSFIRE H-band spectroscopic measurements covering the [CIII]1907, CIII]1909 doublet for a sample of 8 z 7 spectroscopically-confirmed star-forming galaxies drawn from the Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS). This REBELS-MOSFIRE sample is notable for its bright median UV luminosity (Muv=-22.5 AB) and large median stellar mass (log(Mstar/Msun)=9.2). Although three sources show tentative evidence of a CIII] detection, we obtain no confident detections for any of the 8 REBELS-MOSFIRE sources. The median [CIII]1907+CIII]1909 3-sigma upper limit in equivalent width (EW) for the REBELS-MOSFIRE sample is 6.5 AA, and a stack of their H-band MOSFIRE spectra yields a non-detection with an associated 3-sigma upper limit of 2.6 AA. These upper limits fall significantly below the CIII] EW measured in a composite spectrum of representative z 7 star-forming galaxies, as well as those measured for notable early star-forming galaxies such as GN-z11, GHZ2, GS-z12, and RXCJ2248-ID. The lack of strong CIII] emission can be understood within the context of the stellar populations of the REBELS galaxies, as well as the ionization conditions and gas-phase metallicity implied by rest-frame optical spectroscopic properties ([OIII]+Hb EWs, and [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 and [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 line ratios). The REBELS-MOSFIRE sample represents the higher-mass, higher-metallicity, lower-excitation tail of the z 7 galaxy population, whose ionizing properties must be fully characterized to constrain the role of star-forming galaxies during cosmic reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIRACLE II: Unveiling the multi-phase gas interplay in the circumnuclear region of NGC 1365 via multi-cloud modeling</a><span class="id">[2507.08077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-phase study of the gas in the circumnuclear region ( 1.1x1.0 kpc^2) of the nearby Seyfert 1.8 galaxy NGC 1365, observed in the context of the Mid-IR Activity of Circumnuclear Line Emission (MIRACLE) program. We combined spatially resolved spectroscopic observations from JWST/MIRI, VLT/MUSE, and ALMA to investigate the ionized atomic gas and the warm and cold molecular phases. MIRI data revealed over 40 mid-IR emission lines from ionized and warm molecular gas. Moment maps show that both cold and warm molecular gas follow the rotation of the stellar disk along the circumnuclear ring. The ionized gas displays flux and kinematic patterns that depend on ionization potential (IP): low-IP species (&lt;25 eV) trace the disk, while higher-IP lines (up to  120 eV) trace outflowing material. The [O III]5700 and [Ne V]14 lines both trace the southeast nuclear outflow cone. Additionally, [Ne V]14 detects the northwest counter-cone, obscured in the optical and thus invisible in [O III]5700. Mid-IR diagnostics, unlike optical ones, clearly reveal the AGN as the primary ionization source in the nucleus. Emission from high-IP species is spatially coincident with the ionization cones and not with star-forming regions. Using the [Ne V]24/[Ne V]14 ratio, we derive an electron density of (750+-440) cm^(-3), in agreement with values from the [S II] optical doublet. For the first time, we apply a fully self-consistent approach combining advanced photoionization and kinematic models (HOMERUN+MOKA3D) to constrain intrinsic outflow properties, overcoming the limitations of simplified classical methods. Exploiting the synergy of JWST/MIRI and VLT/MUSE, HOMERUN reproduces fluxes of over 60 emission lines from optical to mid-IR, disentangling AGN and star formation contributions and yielding robust estimates of outflow mass, geometry, and energetics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SISSI: Supernovae in a stratified, shearing interstellar medium.

Previous estimates placed the age of the LB at \sim 14 Myr, and attributed its expansion to \sim 15-20 supernovae (SNe), yet a companion paper suggests this age may be overestimated. We place new constraints on the age of the LB and re-evaluate the question whether its expansion triggered or suppressed local star formation. We reconstruct the LB's geometry and momentum using publicly available 3D dust maps and compare them to the high-quality sample of simulated supernova remnants in the SISSI project. Independent constraints on the star-formation history and supernova rate are obtained from a Gaia DR3-based census of nearby star clusters. We find that \sim 7-59 SNe over \sim 5.8 Myr to \sim 2.8 Myr, respectively, are required to explain both the LB's momentum and size and confirm that such a high supernova rate can be sustained by local star clusters. Our analysis yields a substantially smaller LB age than previous estimates, requiring a correspondingly larger number of SNe, driving its expansion. We show that this result is in tension with the conclusion that the LB is powered solely by SNe from the Scorpius-Centaurus OB association, which ceased star formation around the time the LB formed. If our estimates are correct, it follows that the majority of star formation in the solar neighborhood happened before the formation of the LB and was not triggered by its expansion. Instead, the SNe that powered the LB appear to overall have quenched the ongoing star formation process. This does not rule out that star formation in the clouds, located near its current edge, could have been affected by the LB expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of cosmic filaments on the abundance of satellite galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.22179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$–$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved Radiative Transfer Corrections in Helium Emission Lines</a><span class="id">[2510.02045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new detailed model of the He I collisional-recombination spectrum based on the most up-to-date atomic data.

The model reveals substantial deviations in the emissivities of the lambda3889 and lambda7065 lines in the case of a non-zero optical depth, with previous models systematically underestimating and overestimating them by 5 to 20 percent, respectively. In the optically thin case, however, our results show good agreement with previous studies. Using the new model, we compute optically thin emissivities for a wide set of UV, optical, and IR He I recombination lines over a fine grid of electron densities and temperatures typical for H II regions and planetary nebulae (1 &lt;= ne &lt;= 10^4 cm^-3, 8000 &lt;= Te &lt;= 22000 K).

Moreover, thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) measurements probing the thermal pressure of similar galaxies indicate it is orders-of-magnitude lower than predictions from simple halo hydrodynamics and many hydrodynamical simulations. We demonstrate that these constraints can be met congruously with a large non-thermal pressure contribution in the form of cosmic rays (CRs) from SNe and/or AGN, which lowers the tSZ signal while CR leptons produce plentiful soft X-rays via inverse Compton scattering of the CMB. The combination of these two observations is far more constraining on the pressure budget of galactic halos than either alone – if these novel tSZ and X-ray observations are borne out by future studies, then taken together they reveal \textit{the strongest evidence for CR support in halos to date}. Conversely, it is very difficult to produce the extended X-rays via traditional thermal emission without increasing the overall thermal pressure and thus tSZ signal in tandem, making these tensions even worse. Finally, tSZ &amp; X-rays together unlock a novel observational method to constrain halo CR pressure relative to thermal pressure, with implications for CR transport parameters and AGN feedback energetics across various galaxy mass scales. Taking the currently observed constraints at M$_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{\rm 12} \rm M_\odot$ imply the halo CR pressure must at least be equal to the gas thermal pressure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The selection function of the Gaia DR3 open cluster census</a><span class="id">[2510.18343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Open clusters are among the most useful and widespread tracers of Galactic structure.

For the first time ever, we establish the selection function of an entire open cluster census, publishing our results as an open-source Python package for use by the community. Our work is valid for the Hunt &amp; Reffert catalogue of clusters in Gaia DR3. We developed and open-sourced our cluster simulator from our first work. Then, we performed 80,590 injection and retrievals of simulated open clusters to test the Hunt &amp; Reffert catalogue's sensitivity. We fit a logistic model of cluster detectability that depends only on a cluster's number of stars, median parallax error, Gaia data density, and a user-specified significance threshold. We find that our simple model accurately predicts cluster detectability, with a 94.53\% accuracy on our training data that is comparable to a machine-learning based model with orders of magnitude more parameters. Our model itself offers numerous insights on why certain clusters are detected. We briefly use our model to show that cluster detectability depends on non-intuitive parameters, such as a cluster's proper motion, and we show that even a modest 25 km/s boost to a cluster's orbital speed can result in an almost 3$\times$ higher detection probability, depending on its position. In addition, we publish our raw cluster injection and retrievals and cluster memberships, which could be used for a number of other science cases – such as estimating cluster membership incompleteness. Using our results, selection effect-corrected studies are now possible with the open cluster census.

We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE, quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity ($f_{\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\rm disc}$). We assess the impact of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that barred disc galaxies host a higher fraction of AGN compared to their unbarred counterparts, though the significance depends on the AGN selection method, with a more modest excess for SED AGN, and control sample size. This suggests a contributing role for bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host galaxy's emission ($f_{\rm AGN} &lt; 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.75$, independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\rm disc}$. Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars may contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1).

In this paper, we aim to understand the link between these processes and their relation with the stellar mass of galaxies and their local environment. Taking advantage of the first data released by the Euclid Collaboration, covering more than 60 deg2 with space-based imaging and photometry, we analyse a mass-complete sample of nearly one million galaxies in the range 0.25&lt;z&lt;1 with $M_\ast&gt;10^{9.5} M_\odot$. We divide the sample into four sub-populations of galaxies, based on their star-formation activity and morphology. We then analyse the physical properties of these populations and their relative abundances in the stellar mass vs. local density plane. Together with confirming the passivity-density relation and the morphology-density relation, we find that quiescent discy galaxies are more abundant in the low-mass regime of high-density environment. At the same time, star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies are more common in field regions, preferentially at high masses. Building on these results and interpreting them through comparison with simulations, we propose a scenario where the evolution of galaxies in the field significantly differs from that in higher-density environments. The morphological transformation in the majority of field galaxies takes place before the onset of quenching and is mainly driven by secular processes taking place within the main sequence, leading to the formation of star-forming bulge-dominated galaxies as intermediate-stage galaxies. Conversely, quenching of star formation precedes morphological transformation for most galaxies in higher-density environments. This causes the formation of quiescent disc-dominated galaxies before their transition into bulge-dominated ones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explosions in the Empty: A Survey of Transients in Local Void Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.15401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic analysis of transient astrophysical events – including supernovae (SNe), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), and fast radio bursts (FRBs) – in void and non-void galaxies within the local universe ($0.005 &lt; z &lt; 0.05$). Cosmic voids, defined by low galaxy densities and characterized by minimal environmental interactions, offer a natural laboratory for isolating the impact of large-scale underdensities on stellar evolution and transient production. Using multi-wavelength data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Sternberg Astronomical Institute Supernova Catalogue, and high-energy space observatories, we compare transient occurrence rates and host galaxy properties across environments. We find that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are significantly more common in void galaxies, indicating that massive star formation remains active in underdense regions. In contrast, Type Ia supernovae are less frequent in voids, consistent with a scarcity of older stellar populations. Notably, we identify a short-duration GRB hosted by a void galaxy, demonstrating that compact object mergers can occur in isolated environments. Additionally, we find no FRBs associated with void galaxies. Taken together, these results show that cosmic voids exert a measurable influence on the star formation history of galaxies and hence on the production of transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies -II.

GN-z11 at z=10.6 is one of these galaxies. One possible scenario for such a high N/O ratio is pollution from supermassive stars (SMSs), from which stellar winds are expected to be nitrogen-rich. The abundance pattern is determined by both galaxy evolution and SMS pollution, but so far, simple one-zone models have been used. Using a galaxy formation simulation, we tested the SMS scenario. We used a cosmological zoom-in simulation that includes chemical evolution driven by rotating massive stars (Wolf-Rayet stars), supernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. As a post-process, we assumed the formation of an SMS with a mass between $10^3$ and $10^5$ $M_\odot$ and investigated the contribution of its ejecta to the abundance pattern. The N/O ratio was enhanced by the SMS ejecta, and the abundance pattern of GN-z11, including carbon-to-oxygen and oxygen-to-hydrogen ratios, was reproduced by our SMS pollution model if the pollution mass fraction ranges within 10-30 per cent. Such a pollution fraction can be realized when the gas ionized by the SMS is polluted, and the gas density is $10^4$-$10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ assuming a Strömgren sphere. We also compared the abundance pattern with those of other N/O-enhanced high-$z$ galaxies. Some of these galaxies can also be explained by SMS pollution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The drastic impact of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on massive star populations</a><span class="id">[2601.08822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars are the key engines of the Universe. However, their evolution and thus their ionizing feedback are still not fully understood. One of the largest gaps in current stellar evolution calculations is the lack of a model for the mass ejections that occur when the stars reach the Eddington limit, such as during an Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) phase. We aim to remedy this situation by providing a physically motivated and empirically calibrated method applicable in any 1D stellar evolution code to approximate the effect of such mass loss on stellar evolution. We employ the 1D stellar evolution code MESA, in which we implement a new mass-loss prescription that is acting when stellar models inflate too much when reaching the Eddington limit. Synthetic massive-star stellar populations using calculated grids of single-star models with this mass loss prescription are compared with the observed populations in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. In combination with already computed grids of binary evolution models, we investigate the impact of binarity on our predictions. Our single-star models reproduce key features of the observed stellar populations, namely (i) the absence of stars located beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit, (ii) an upper limit of RSG luminosities, (iii) the faintest observed single WR stars, (iv) the absolute number of O-stars, WRs, and RSGs, (v) WO stars in low metallicity environments, and (vi) the positions of LBV stars in the HRD. Our binary population explains at the same time the 70% binary fraction of O-stars and the 40% binary fraction of WR stars. However, our synthetic population also has caveats, such as an overproduction of bright H-free WN stars. Our results show that the effect of Eddington-limit induced mass ejections on the structure and evolution of massive stars can remove tension between predicted and observed massive star populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indirect searches for realistic sub-GeV Dark Matter models</a><span class="id">[2508.03819]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Indirect searches for Dark Matter (DM) particles with mass in the MeV – GeV scale have received significant attention lately.

We focus on two representative realistic sub-GeV DM models, namely, the vector-portal kinetic-mixing model and the higgs-portal model, and perform a detailed study of the indirect detection constraints from existing $X$-rays, $\gamma$-rays and cosmic-ray observations, based on all of the above-mentioned signals. We also estimate the future prospects from the upcoming MeV photon telescope COSI, including all possible types of prompt and secondary emission signals.

This paper extends a previous theoretical framework for stellar surface mapping, along three primary directions: (1) we derive analytical selection rules showing that astrometry is sensitive to spherical harmonic modes not detectable via photometry, particularly odd-$\ell$ modes that encode north-south asymmetries; (2) we quantify the information content of combined photometric and astrometric observations, showing that the rank of observable modes grows faster for combined observations than for either technique alone, though the fraction of recoverable modes still decreases asymptotically with increasing spatial resolution; and (3) we reframe astrometric jitter-traditionally treated as noise in exoplanet studies-as a signal encoding stellar surface structure. Given the limited proposed target lists of high-precision astrometric missions, this capability is particularly valuable: understanding host star surfaces is crucial for both removing stellar signals from exoplanet detections and characterising star-planet interactions.

This noise may limit our ability to detect and weigh small, sub-Neptune-sized planets around active stars. By deriving a linear forward model for the astrometric jitter signal of a rotating star in a spherical-harmonic coordinate system, we show that jitter noise can be used to reconstruct surface-brightness maps and, in principle, disentangle jitter from stellar reflex motion due to an orbiting planet. Furthermore, we show that astrometry and photometry probe complementary surface information: photometry measures even-degree spherical harmonic surfaces that are symmetric about the equator, while astrometry measures odd-degree modes. Their joint use, therefore, breaks degeneracies in surface mapping. Our model further quantifies the variation in the astrometric signal with inclination angle, which is foundational for studies of worst-case configurations of astrometric star-spot noise. For example, we show that pole-on stellar inclinations lead to poorly constrained inversions, as any stellar surface produces a purely circular astrometric jitter signal. We characterize the degeneracy in jointly identifying the stellar surface and stellar inclination, and develop a surface estimation approach.

However, template-based search cannot detect astrophysical sources that lack accurate waveform models, including core-collapse supernovae, neutron star glitches, and cosmic strings. Here, we present a novel approach for template-free search using coincident anomaly detection (CoAD). CoAD requires neither labeled training examples nor background-only training sets, instead exploiting the coincidence of events across spatially separated detectors as the training loss itself: two neural networks independently analyze data from each detector and are trained to maximize coincident predictions. Additionally, we show that integrated gradient analysis can localize GW signals from the neural-network weights, providing a path toward data-driven template construction of unmodeled sources, and further improving precision by frequency matching. Using the CodaBench dataset of real LIGO backgrounds with injected simulated CBCs and sine-Gaussian low-frequency bursts, CoAD achieves recall up to 0.91 and 0.85 respectively at a false-alarm rate of one event per year, and achieves recall above 0.5 at signal-to-noise ratios below 10. The fully-unsupervised nature of CoAD makes it especially well-suited for next-generation detectors with greater sensitivity and associated increases in GW event rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12094" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncovering the Next Galactic Supernova with the Vera C.

Based on historical records, however, the last core-collapse galactic supernova observed by humans occurred almost 1,000 years ago. Luckily, we are well positioned to catch the next one with the advent of new neutrino detectors and astronomical observatories. Neutrino observatories can provide unprecedented triggers for a galactic supernova event as they are likely to see a supernova neutrino signal anywhere from minutes to days before the shock breakout causes the supernova to brighten in optical wavelengths. Given its large etendue, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is ideally positioned to rapidly localize the optical counterpart based on the neutrino trigger. In this paper we simulate events to study the efficiency with which supernovae are optimally localized by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We find that the observatory is ideal for initial localization of nearly all observable supernova triggers and has a 57-97% chance of catching any supernova based on theoretical stellar mass density predictions and observations. We provide an analysis of optimal filter selection and exposure times and discuss observational caveats.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PyIRD: A Python-Based Data Reduction Pipeline for Subaru/IRD and REACH</a><span class="id">[2601.12669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PyIRD is a Python-based pipeline for reducing spectroscopic data obtained with IRD (InfraRed Doppler; Kotani et al.

The study focuses on potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs) as primary exploration targets. This paper proposes a method for calculating SC trajectories that enable asteroid flybys after a Venus gravity assist. The method involves formulating and solving an optimization problem to design trajectories incorporating flybys of selected asteroids and Venus. Trajectories are calculated using two-body dynamics by solving the Lambert problem. A preliminary search for candidate asteroids uses an algorithm to narrow the search space of the optimization problem. This algorithm uses the V-infinity globe technique to connect planetary gravity assists with resonant orbits. The resonant orbit in this case serves as an initial approximation for the SC's trajectory between two successive planetary flybys. Four flight schemes were analyzed, including multiple flybys of Venus and asteroids, with the possibility of an SC returning to Earth. The proposed solutions reduce flight time between asteroid approaches, increase gravity assist frequency, and enhance mission design flexibility. The use of Venus gravity assists and resonant orbits ensures a close encounter with at least one asteroid during the SC's trajectory between two consecutive flybys of Venus, and demonstrates the feasibility of periodic Venus gravity assists and encounters with PHAs. The developed method was applied to construct trajectories that allow an SC to approach both Venus-resonant asteroids and PHAs via multiple Venus gravity assists. An additional study was carried out to identify asteroids accessible during the Earth-Venus segment in launch windows between 2029 and 2050.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of false positive double-lined spectroscopic binaries in LAMOST-MRS data due to moonlight contamination</a><span class="id">[2601.12824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a method for identifying false positive double-lined spectroscopic binary (SB2) candidates by analysing medium-resolution survey spectra from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) DR10. Specifically, we focus on spectra contaminated by moonlight, which exhibit near-zero radial velocity (RV) and solar-like spectral lines from the secondary component. By applying strict constraints on the contamination parameters and fitting the contaminated spectra, we ultimately confirmed that 126 false positive binaries are single stars contaminated by moonlight. Additionally, we identify several key factors contributing to moonlight contamination: the lunar phase during observation, the G-band magnitude of the star, and the angular distance between the star and the moon. Notably, artificial satellites in low-orbital can also introduce contamination from solar-like spectral components, but they typically display significantly higher transverse velocities. In a follow-up study, we will expand our analysis to identify additional false positive SB2 systems and systematically classify them according to their contamination sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optomechanical design of the DragonCam microscopic camera</a><span class="id">[2601.13221]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The DragonCam Microscopic Camera is an instrument being developed for NASA's Dragonfly mission [1] to Saturn's moon Titan. The Microscopic Camera will be body-fixed to the Dragonfly vehicle and will image the surface at a distance of about one meter (98.6 cm nominal) with a pixel scale of better than 60 microns/pixel and a nominal 52 degree angle to the Titan surface. With the 4.8 um pixel pitch of the sensor, this is a focal length of about 77.5 mm. To accommodate range variations due to vehicle pose and surface topography, the Microscopic Camera has a focus mechanism to give it a depth of field (DOF) of about 130mm. Since the Microscopic Camera's boresight is tilted by 52° off the vertical, the optical configuration has a compensating tilted focal plane, taking advantage of the Scheimpflug imaging principle. The optics are all-refractive with nine elements, a six-element stationary group and a three-element moving group. A plano-plano window seals the optics from the environment and also serves as the substrate for a bandpass filter. The optomechanical system is derived from the Mars Hand Lens Imager [11]; the moving group is mounted to a linear slide which is translated via a cam follower by the rotation of a cam driven by a stepper motor. The Microscopic Camera is designed to survive at temperatures as low as -130C without power. The camera is enclosed in a cavity in the foam insulation covering the spacecraft and looking through a single-pane window. Prior to imaging, the camera will be heated to operating temperature (nominal -30C) for proper actuation of the mechanism. STOP analysis has been performed to demonstrate that optical performance is maintained after heating. Software focus merging will be performed in the onboard camera control electronics to minimize image data downlink requirements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variability as a new discovery channel for Intermediate-Mass Black Holes in the Time Domain Era</a><span class="id">[2601.13311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Between the groundbreaking detections of stellar-mass black holes by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA and JWST's revelation of a surprisingly abundant population of supermassive black holes, one crucial missing link remains: the elusive intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). IMBHs represent a key phase in the hierarchical growth of black holes, yet they have persistently evaded detection. Traditional methods, effective for both actively accreting and quiescent black holes, have largely failed to uncover this hidden population. Here, we argue that novel observational strategies–particularly time-domain variability studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and tidal disruption events–provide a promising path forward. Finding IMBHs will resolve critical gaps in our understanding of black hole formation and the various mechanisms driving their subsequent growth. The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory, with its unprecedented capacity to monitor the dynamic sky, stands to revolutionize our ability to detect these long-sought IMBHs, shedding new light on the assembly history of black holes across cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ESA Meerkat Asteroid Guard: a monitoring service for imminent impactors</a><span class="id">[2601.13323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the Meerkat Asteroid Guard, an imminent impactor warning service developed and maintained by the European Space Agency's Near-Earth Object Coordination Centre (NEOCC).

In the absence of large-scale structure, closure phases constructed with these stations are zero and, since they are independent of station-based errors, they can be used to probe data issues. Here, we show with an expansion about co-located stations, how these trivial closure phases become non-zero with brightness distribution on smaller scales than their short baseline would suggest. When applied to sources that are made up of a bright compact and large-scale diffuse component, the trivial closure phases directly measure the centroid relative to the compact source and higher-order image moments. We present a technique to measure these image moments with minimal model assumptions and validate it on synthetic Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) data. We then apply this technique to 2017 and 2018 EHT observations of M87* and find a weak preference for extended emission in the direction of the large-scale jet. We also apply it to 2021 EHT data and measure the source centroid about 1 mas northwest of the compact ring, consistent with the jet observed at lower frequencies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dual tunnel structure for the Einstein Telescope</a><span class="id">[2601.13438]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel tunnel architecture for the Einstein Telescope that departs from the traditional large-cavern approach and reduces the excavated volume by an order of magnitude.

Two different kinds of observations are presented. We first analyze observations of Vega taken in a three-telescope mode. (Previously, the instrument had only two operational stations.) We show that, while the efficiency remains nearly identical to that reported in our last paper, the addition of the third station allows more photon data to be recorded simultaneously, and therefore we can build up the photon-bunching peak in the data stream in fewer hours on sky for an unresolved source. In the second part of the paper, we report our observations to date of the nearby red giant star, Arcturus, most of which occurred in the first half of 2025. These show that, as a partially resolved source at the baselines we used, we detect fewercorrelations in the photon-bunching peak than for an unresolved source of comparable brightness. Combining the data with speckle imaging observations taken at Apache Point Observatory, we derive a new measurement of Arcturus' diameter that extends the time baseline of interferometric observations of the star and is consistent with previous analyses made by other investigators.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The R2Pub Telescopes for Surveying: An Overview and Performance Evaluation of the System</a><span class="id">[2601.13587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The R2Pub telescope, built by the Beijing Planetarium, is a 60 cm equatorial binocular telescope located at the Daocheng site of Yunnan Observatories in China, at an altitude of about 4700 m. This paper presents an overview of the R2Pub telescope system, including its design, instrumentation, and survey capabilities, and reports an initial evaluation of its system performance. R2Pub is a prime-focus binocular system, with each optical tube covering a field of view of approximately 18 square degrees. It is designed to detect a wide range of transient and variable sources in the local universe, such as variable stars, eclipsing binaries, supernovae, gamma-ray burst afterglows, tidal disruption events, active galactic nuclei, and other unknown transients. The observatory infrastructure, including the dome, equatorial mount, optical tubes, and associated subsystems, has been fully constructed and installed, and the system has entered the commissioning phase. Benefiting from the high-altitude location, good seeing conditions, and dark sky background at the Daocheng site, performance tests during commissioning show that the R2Pub system can reach a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of about 18.7 mag in the Pan-STARRS r' band with a 60 s exposure. Ongoing observations with R2Pub are expected to contribute to studies of variable and transient phenomena and to enhance public outreach in astronomy. The binocular design enables simultaneous dual-band observations, providing instantaneous color information for transient sources and improving the classification and physical characterization of their properties and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) II. The radial structure of debris discs</a><span class="id">[2601.13670]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) was recently completed to cover the lack of high-resolution observations of debris discs and to investigate the prevalence of substructures such as radial gaps and rings in a sample of 24 discs. This study characterises the radial structure of debris discs in the ARKS programme. To identify and quantify the disc substructures, we modelled all discs with a range of non-parametric and parametric approaches. We find that of the 24 discs in the sample, 5 host multiple rings, 7 are single rings that display halos or additional low-amplitude rings, and 12 are single rings with at most tentative evidence of additional substructures. The fractional ring widths that we measured are significantly narrower than previously derived values, and they follow a distribution similar to the fractional widths of individual rings resolved in protoplanetary discs. However, there exists a population of rings in debris discs that are significantly wider than those in protoplanetary discs. We also find that discs with steep inner edges consistent with planet sculpting tend to be found at smaller (&lt;100 au) radii, while more radially extended discs tend to have shallower edges more consistent with collisional evolution. An overwhelming majority of discs have radial profiles well-described by either a double power law or double-Gaussian parametrisation. While our findings suggest that it may be possible for some debris discs to inherit their structures directly from protoplanetary discs, there exists a sizeable population of broad debris discs that cannot be explained in this way. Assuming that the distribution of millimetre dust reflects the distribution of planetesimals, mechanisms that cause rings in protoplanetary discs to migrate or debris discs to broaden soon after formation may be at play, possibly mediated by planetary migration or scattering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospecting MeerKAT Continuum Data for Enigmatic Radio Sources with Unsupervised Vector-Quantised Variational Autoencoders</a><span class="id">[2601.13901]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel application of Vector quantised variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) to deep 1.28 GHz radio continuum images taken from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS).VQ-VAEs are deep learning models widely used in modern computer vision applications and pipelines.

VQ-VAEs effectively learn the distribution of training data, where samples that do not fit the distribution well yield the highest reconstruction errors. This property makes VQ-VAEs a good candidate for the task of anomaly detection. In this work, we examine the effectiveness of VQ-VAEs in identifying radio continuum sources with anomalous structures in the image-plane domain. We find VQ-VAEs to be useful as part of a solution for searching such large datasets.

We derive a point-spread function describing the angular resolution of a PTA. We investigate how the point spread function changes for different PTA constellations and determine the best possible angular resolution achievable within our framework. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that previous methods do not capture the actual resolution - especially in regions of the sky with a high density of pulsars. We propose an improved scheme that accounts for a variable local resolution and test it using realistic simulations of the latest MeerKAT dataset.

We applied GP regression to simultaneous TESS photometric and RV data of HD 5562, a G-type subgiant ($M_\star=1.09M_{\odot}$, $R_\star=1.88R_{\odot}$) with a V magnitude of 7.17, using photometry to inform the priors for RV fitting. The RV data is obtained by the Magellan Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS). The photometry-informed GP regression reduced the RV scatter of HD 5562 from 2.03 to 0.51 m/s. We performed injection and recovery tests to evaluate the potential of GPs for discovering small exoplanets around evolved stars, which demonstrate that the GP provides comparable noise reduction to the binning method. We also found that the necessity of photometric data depends on the quality of the RV dataset.

Atmospheric retrievals are uniquely suited to analyse these datasets and characterize the aerosols present in exoplanet atmospheres. However, including the optical properties of condensed particles within retrieval frameworks remains computationally expensive, limiting our ability to fully exploit JWST observations. In this work, we improve the computational efficiency and scaling behavior of aerosol models in atmospheric retrievals, enabling in-depth studies including multiple condensate species within practical time scales. Rather than computing the aerosol Mie coefficients for each sampled model, we pre-compute extinction efficiency (Qext), scattering efficiency (Qscat) and asymmetry parameter (g) grids for seven condensate species relevant in exoplanet atmospheres (Mg2SiO4 amorph sol - gel, MgSiO3 amorph glass, MgSiO3 amorph sol - gel, SiO2 alpha, SiO2 amorph, SiO and Titan tholins). The pre-computed Qext grids significantly reduce computation time between 1.4 and 17 times with negligible differences on the retrieved parameters. They also scale effortlessly with the number of aerosol species while maintaining the accuracy of cloud models. Thereby enabling more complex retrievals as well as broader population studies without increasing the overall error budget.

The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful, scalable, and operationally reliable. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are already embedded across DESC science workflows, from photometric redshifts and transient classification to weak lensing inference and cosmological simulations. Yet their utility for precision cosmology hinges on trustworthy uncertainty quantification, robustness to covariate shift and model misspecification, and reproducible integration within scientific pipelines. This white paper surveys the current landscape of AI/ML across DESC's primary cosmological probes and cross-cutting analyses, revealing that the same core methodologies and fundamental challenges recur across disparate science cases. Since progress on these cross-cutting challenges would benefit multiple probes simultaneously, we identify key methodological research priorities, including Bayesian inference at scale, physics-informed methods, validation frameworks, and active learning for discovery. With an eye on emerging techniques, we also explore the potential of the latest foundation model methodologies and LLM-driven agentic AI systems to reshape DESC workflows, provided their deployment is coupled with rigorous evaluation and governance. Finally, we discuss critical software, computing, data infrastructure, and human capital requirements for the successful deployment of these new methodologies, and consider associated risks and opportunities for broader coordination with external actors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lessons Learned from Structural Design and Vibration Testing of 50-kg Microsatellites Deployed from the International Space Station</a><span class="id">[2601.12840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hokkaido University and Tohoku University have been developing and operating a constellation of 50-cm-class microsatellites for Earth observation. DIWATA-1, launched in 2016, was deployed into a circular orbit at an altitude of approximately 400 km from the International Space Station (ISS). For the subsequent satellite developed in 2021, the structural design and vibration test campaign were optimized to meet a strict one-year development schedule. This paper summarizes how the structural design of the previous satellite was reviewed and updated, and how the vibration test was successfully completed in a single trial to minimize schedule and technical risks. These lessons learned provide valuable insights, as there are only a limited number of reported cases of 50-kg-class microsatellites deployed from the ISS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">System Analysis and Pre-Flight Evaluation of Deployable Solar Panels for 3U CubeSat HOKUSHIN-1</a><span class="id">[2601.12851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper describes the system design methodology derived from the development and evaluation tests of deployable solar panels to be mounted on a 3U CubeSat.

Despite promising innovations, existing resources are often poorly documented, designed for one-time events, expensive, and lack interdisciplinary collaboration, user testing, and broad dissemination. AMACA addresses these challenges by creating multi-sensory activities for education and outreach, with a particular focus on accessibility for people with sensory disabilities. A circular approach informs its educational structure: (1) a PhD course on multi-sensory astronomy outreach develops hands-on activities with the support of astronomers, psychologists, and organizations for the visually impaired and the deaf; (2) PhD candidates teach High School (HS) students how to deliver the activities; (3) HS students lead the activities at the Astronomy Festival &quot;The Universe in All Senses&quot;; (4) HS students train teachers to implement the activities in their classrooms. AMACA also develops tools to guide project development and track participants' learning. Key findings show improved communication and accessibility awareness among PhD candidates, increased emotional engagement with astronomy among HS students, enhanced public engagement with research and accessibility awareness, and high teacher satisfaction with the flipped-roles, hands-on approach. Overall, AMACA enhances accessibility and engagement in astronomy education across audiences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13583" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AAFIYA: Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment</a><span class="id">[2601.13583]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents AAFIYA (Antenna Analysis in Frequency-domain for Impedance and Yield Assessment), a modular Python toolkit for automated characterization of radio-frequency antennas using measurement and simulation data.

AAFIYA is validated using measurements from an electromagnetic anechoic chamber involving Log Periodic Dipole Array (LPDA) reference antennas and Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) Bottom Vertically Polarized antennas over 100-850 MHz. Extracted metrics, including impedance matching, realized gain patterns, vector effective lengths, and cross-polarization ratio, are compared against full-wave simulations from HFSS and WIPL-D, showing good agreement across frequency and angle.

By leveraging machine-learning techniques and neural density estimators, it enables flexible likelihood or posterior modeling directly from simulations. We introduce Residual Neural Likelihood Estimation (RNLE), a modification of Neural Likelihood Estimation (NLE) that learns the likelihood of non-Gaussian noise in gravitational-wave detector data. Exploiting the additive structure of the signal and noise generation processes, RNLE directly models the noise distribution, substantially reducing the number of simulations required for accurate parameter estimation and improving robustness to realistic noise artifacts. The performance of RNLE is demonstrated using a toy model, simulated gravitational-wave signals, and real detector noise from ground based interferometers. Even in the presence of loud non-Gaussian transients, glitches, we show that RNLE can achieve reliable parameter recovery when trained on appropriately constructed datasets. We further assess the stability of the method by quantifying the variability introduced by retraining the conditional density estimator on statistically identical datasets with different optimization seeds, referred to as training noise. This variability can be mitigated through an ensemble approach that combines multiple RNLE models using evidence-based weighting. An implementation of RNLE is publicly available in the sbilby package, enabling its deployment within gravitational-wave astronomy and a broad range of scientific applications requiring flexible, simulation-based likelihood estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JEM-EUSO Collaboration contributions to the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference</a><span class="id">[2312.08204]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is a collection of papers presented by the JEM-EUSO Collaboration at the 38th International Cosmic Ray Conference (Nagoya, Japan, July 26-August 3, 2023)</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmoglobe DR2. III. Improved modelling of zodiacal light with COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</a><span class="id">[2408.11004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an improved zodiacal light (ZL) model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is inspired by the original DIRBE model by Kelsall et al. (K98), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\lesssim 3\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 ZL Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\sim 30$ kJy/sr at 1.25–3.5 $\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. At high Galactic latitudes, the total RMS of each DR2 map is lower than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA map of $\sim$ 80 \% at wavelengths 4.9–25 $\mu\mathrm{m}$. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.

Multi-messenger lepto-hadronic models based on proton-photon (p-gamma) interactions result in predictions for the neutrino spectra (”p-gamma spectra”) which are typically strongly peaked at PeV energies. In contrast, statistical analyses looking to associate blazars and high-energy neutrinos often assume a power-law spectral shape, putting the emphasis at lower energies. We aim to examine the impact of such spectral modelling assumptions on the associations of neutrinos with blazars. We use hierarchical_nu, a Bayesian framework for point source searches, and incorporate the theoretical predictions for neutrino spectra through a dedicated spectral model and priors on the relevant parameters. Our spectral model is based on recent predictions for a selection of intermediate and high synchrotron peaked blazars that have been found to be spatially close to high-energy events detected by IceCube. We apply our model to the 10 years of publicly available muon track IceCube data aimed at point source searches, focusing on the Northern hemisphere. Out of 29 source candidates, we find five sources, including TXS 0506+056, that have an association probability $P_\mathrm{assoc} &gt; 0.5$ to at least one event. The p-gamma spectra typically lead to a lower overall number of associated events compared to the power-law case, but retain or even enhance strong associations to high-energy events. Our results demonstrate that including more information from theoretical predictions can allow for more interpretable source-neutrino connections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation-based inference with deep ensembles: Evaluating calibration uncertainty and detecting model misspecification</a><span class="id">[2507.13495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) offers a principled and flexible framework for conducting Bayesian inference in any situation where forward simulations are feasible. However, validating the accuracy and reliability of the inferred posteriors remains a persistent challenge. In this work, we point out a simple diagnostic approach rooted in ensemble learning methods to assess the internal consistency of SBI outputs that does not require access to the true posterior. By training multiple neural estimators under identical conditions and evaluating their pairwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences, we define a consistency criterion that quantifies agreement across the ensemble. We highlight two core use cases for this framework: a) for generating a robust estimate of the systematic uncertainty in parameter reconstruction associated with the training procedure, and b) for detecting possible model misspecification when using trained estimators on real data. We also demonstrate the relationship between significant KL divergences and issues such as insufficient convergence due to, e.g., too low a simulation budget, or intrinsic variance in the training process. Overall, this ensemble-based diagnostic framework provides a lightweight, scalable, and model-agnostic tool for enhancing the trustworthiness of SBI in scientific applications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Precision Polarization Array: Sensitivity for the axion-like dark matter with clock satellites</a><span class="id">[2511.04400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. To constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods and investigate the sensitivity of APPA using two complementary approaches: Likelihood analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for the axion mass range of $10^{-22}-10^{-18}$ eV, APPA yields a tighter upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations, while also achieving superior detection sensitivity. Moreover, a larger spatial distribution scale of the satellite network corresponds to a greater advantage in detecting axions with lighter masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Historical Surveys to Rubin First Look: Absolute Colors of trans-Neptunian objects</a><span class="id">[2511.10782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive photometric study of transNeptunian objects (TNOs) by combining data from SDSS, Col-OSSOS, DES, and the recent Rubin First Look (RFL) data. Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects. From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits. Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey. We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST COMPASS: Insights into the Systematic Noise Properties of NIRSpec/G395H From a Uniform Reanalysis of Seven Transmission Spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.18196]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST has already observed near-infrared transmission spectra of over a dozen super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. While some observations have allowed astronomers to characterize sub-Neptunes in unprecedented detail, small feature amplitudes and poorly-understood systematics have led to ambiguous results for others. Using the first seven targets from the COMPASS program, which is currently surveying 12 small planet atmospheres using NIRSpec/G395H, we investigate these timeseries systematics. We implement a model that uses the principle components of the normalized pixel fluxes to account for variations in the shape and position of the spectral trace. We find that observations with a smaller number of groups-per-integration benefit most profoundly from the use of this model, and that systematics are particularly strong between 2.8 and 3.5 $\mu$m. Despite these systematics, \texttt{pandexo} is a relatively accurate predictor of the precision of the spectra, with real error bars on average 5\% larger in NRS1 and 12\% larger in NRS2 than predicted. We compute new limits on metallicity and opaque pressure level for each target and compare these to previous results from the COMPASS program. Next, we co-add spectra from multiple targets to reduce the effective noise in the combined spectra in hopes of detecting transmission features in common between the targets, but this exercise does not yield compelling evidence any signals. We find that a handful of additional transits are sufficient to break the degeneracy between metallicity and aerosols for the majority of our targets, pointing towards the possibility of unraveling the mysteries of these worlds with future allocations of JWST time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Improved Machine Learning Approach for Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation in FAST-SETI Survey Archival Data</a><span class="id">[2512.15809]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) commensal surveys aim to scan the sky to detect technosignatures from extraterrestrial life. A major challenge in SETI is the effective mitigation of radio frequency interference (RFI), a critical step that is particularly vital for the highly sensitive Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). While initial RFI mitigation (e.g., removal of persistent and drifting narrowband RFI) are essential, residual RFI often persists, posing significant challenges due to its complex and various nature. In this paper, we propose and apply an improved machine learning approach, the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm, to identify and mitigate residual RFI in FAST-SETI commensal survey archival data from July 2019. After initial RFI mitigation, we successfully identify and remove 36977 residual RFIs (accounting for $\sim$ 77.87\%) within approximately 1.678 seconds using the DBSCAN algorithm. This result shows that we have achieved a 7.44\% higher removal rate than previous machine learning methods, along with a 24.85\% reduction in execution time. We finally find interesting candidate signals consistent with previous studies, and retain one candidate signal following further analysis. Therefore, DBSCAN algorithm can mitigate more residual RFI with higher computational efficiency while preserving the candidate signals that we are interested in.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using 23 Years of ACS/SBC Data to Understand Backgrounds: Explaining &amp; Predicting Background Variations</a><span class="id">[2601.09682]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent analysis of 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data has shown that background levels can vary considerably between observations, with most filters showing over an order of magnitude variation. For the shorter-wavelength filters, the background is understood to be dominated by airglow; however, what precisely drives background variations is not well constrained for any filter. Here, we explore the causes of the background variation. Using over 8,000 archival SBC observations, we developed a machine learning model that can accurately predict the background for an observation, based upon a set of 23 observational parameters. This model indicates that, depending on filter, the SBC background is generally dominated by Solar elevation, Solar separation angle, Earth limb angle of observation, SBC temperature, and target Galactic latitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discrete Chi-Square Method can model and forecast complex time series</a><span class="id">[2509.01540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show how intensive, large and accurate time series can allow us to see through time. Many phenomena have aperiodic and periodic components. An ideal time series analysis method would detect such trend and signal(-s) combinations. The widely-used Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and other frequency-domain parametric time series analysis methods have many application limitations constraining the trend and signal(-s) detection. We show that none of those limitations constrains our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM) which can detect signal(-s) superimposed on an unknown trend. Our simulated time series analyses ascertain the revolutionary Window Dimension Effect (WDE): “For any sample window $\Delta T$, DCM inevitably detects the correct $p(t)$ trend and $h(t)$ signal(-s) when the sample size $n$ and/or data accuracy $\sigma$ increase.” The simulations also expose the DFT's weaknesses and the DCM's efficiency. The DCM's backbone is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the Least Squares (LS) is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM can not fail because this simple method is based on the computation of a massive number of linear model LS fits. The Fisher-test gives the signal significance estimates and identifies the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The analytical solution for the non-linear DCM model is an ill-posed problem. We present a computational well-posed solution. The DCM can forecast complex time series. The best DCM model must be correct if it passes our Forecast-test. Our DCM is ideal for forecasting because its WDE spearhead is robust against short sample windows and complex time series.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">105.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automating Sensor Characterization with Bayesian Optimization</a><span class="id">[2509.21661]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The development of novel instrumentation requires an iterative cycle with three stages: design, prototyping, and testing. Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor characterization that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states.
