These systems have orbital periods of 50-62 minutes and cool donors that are undetectable in the optical. The data cover a wavelength range of 1.6-5.2 $\mu$m at resolution $R=1000-2000$. We obtained 150-200 spectra of each system over two orbits, split between the G235M and G395M gratings. All three systems show strong, double-peaked He I emission lines dominated by an accretion disk. These lines are nearly stationary but contain radial velocity (RV) variable sub-components that trace stream-disk interactions. In Gaia14aae and SRGeJ0453, we detect two Na I doublets in emission whose RVs track the irradiated face of the donor, marking the first direct detection of the donors of long-period AM CVns. No absorption lines from the donors are detected, implying that the IR excesses observed in many long-period AM CVns primarily trace disks, not donors. The He I emission profiles in all systems lack high-velocity wings and show no emission beyond $\approx 1500,\rm km,s^{-1}$. The morphology of the disk eclipses and Doppler tomograms are best reproduced by models in which the disk is truncated well outside the white dwarf and only material at $r \gtrsim 0.07,R_{\odot}$ contributes to the disk emission. We interpret this as possible evidence of magnetized white dwarf accretors. For plausible mass transfer rates, the truncation radii imply surface magnetic fields of $B = 30-100$ kG, consistent with recent constraints based on X-ray periodicity. The absence of cyclotron humps out to 5 $\mu$m rules out stronger MG-level fields. We make the data from the program publicly available to the community.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Emission and Suppression of Line Features in Luminous Transients</a><span class="id">[2601.00947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Featureless optical and ultraviolet (UV) spectra are a puzzling signature to emerge from recent observations of luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) and some tidal disruption events (TDEs). We describe the landscape of source and gas properties that are expected to form H, He I and He II emission lines, and map spectral types to the parameter space of luminosity and system radius. Using one-dimensional radiative transfer calculations, we show that high source luminosities ($L &gt; 10^{44}\,\rm erg~s^{-1}$) and compact ejecta radii ($r &lt; 10^{14}\,\rm cm$) produce featureless spectra due to the high temperature and ionization state of the emitting medium. Intermediate luminosities and moderately compact systems can generate He II-dominated spectra, while lower luminosities and more extended atmospheres result in conspicuous H and He I emission. Large expansion velocities ($v \geq 0.1c$) can further broaden lines such that they blend into the continuum. Featureless UV spectra may require even more extreme ionization conditions or velocities to suppress the many intrinsically strong metal lines at those wavelengths. Applying this framework to understand the absence of features observed in LFBOTs and featureless TDEs, we find that non-homologous, compact outflows are likely necessary for featurelessness to persist in optical and UV spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable Metal Pollution in Main-Sequence Stars: Simulations of Rocky Planets Engulfed by Stars in the $0.5$ to $1.4$ M$_\odot$ Range</a><span class="id">[2601.00949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The engulfment of planets by their host stars is an expected outcome of various dynamical processes and has been invoked to explain a variety of observed stellar properties, such as rapid rotation, chemical abundance abnormalities, and other transient phenomena. Recent observations support engulfment as the cause of such signatures; however, many engulfment process details remain uncertain. Here, we present a model for determining the chemical signatures produced due to the pollution of main sequence stars by rocky planets, a common engulfment scenario due to the high frequency of observed short-period rocky exoplanets. A key novel element of our model is that we calculate the gradual evaporation of the planet due to drag interactions with the stellar envelope, which can lead to observable pollution on the stellar surface even if the bulk of the planet is only destroyed below the star's outer convective zone. Our results indicate that rocky planet pollution is most easily measurable for stars in the $1.0$ to $1.4$ M$_\odot$ range and that elements such as aluminium, calcium, and vanadium, in addition to lithium, are most suited to detect pollution. We predict that it is also possible to differentiate between the engulfment of one large planet versus several small planets, for the same total pollution mass, for some stellar hosts. We find that rocky planet engulfment events generally take years to decades for most stars. Our results can guide future observational campaigns that may search for sites of past or current engulfment events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00953" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra Heavy Cosmic Rays from Magnetars</a><span class="id">[2601.00953]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Matter ejected from the neutron star crust during a magnetar giant flare will undergo $r$-process nucleosynthesis during decompression. Ultra heavy ions ($Z \gg 26$) can be accelerated to cosmic ray energies by the reverse shock as the ejecta decelerates by interacting with the ambient environment. We investigate the contribution of magnetars to the local ultra heavy cosmic ray flux using semi-analytic Galactic transport calculations, demonstrating that they may be significant contributors throughout Galactic history depending on the giant flare rate and ion acceleration efficiency. Although neutron star mergers inject orders of magnitude more energy into cosmic rays, they rarely occur within the spallation-limited propagation horizon for ultra heavy species, reducing their local contributions. As compared to lighter nuclei which are dominantly accelerated by supernovae, the SuperTIGER experiment has presented tentative evidence for a distinct contribution to the cosmic ray abundances near and above the first $r$-process peak ($Z \approx 35\text{--}56$). We argue that current abundance data are consistent with either a magnetar giant flare or neutron star merger origin for these species. Measurements with single element resolution through the third $r$-process peak, expected from the upcoming TIGERISS experiment, may discriminate between these sources for the heaviest cosmic rays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A comprehensive study of the relations between the properties of planetary systems and the chemical compositions of their host stars</a><span class="id">[2601.00962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Analysis of the 2019 and 2022 Outbursts of SAX J1808.4-3658</a><span class="id">[2601.00977]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 went into outburst from July to November in 2019 and August to October in 2022, which were observed by \textit{NICER} and \textit{NuSTAR}. In this paper, we first present the light curve for both outbursts using \textit{NICER} data. Several thermonuclear bursts occurred during these outbursts. We analyze the evolution of the spectra of two thermonuclear bursts that took place during the 2019 \textit{NuSTAR} observation. We proceed by analyzing the combined broad-band spectrum using \textit{NICER} and \textit{NuSTAR} for the first time for this source. We jointly modeled the combined quiescent spectra of both outbursts with a self-consistent reflection component. In our best-fit model, we find evidence of reflection, consistently constrain the inclination to 72°$^{+1°}_{-4°}$ considering this reflection, and identify a 1 keV feature during persistent emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing supermassive primordial black holes with lensing signals of binary black hole merges</a><span class="id">[2601.01034]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Next-generation ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors are expected to observe millions of binary black hole mergers, a fraction of which will be strongly lensed by intervening galaxies or clusters, producing multiple images with characteristic distribution of time delay. Importantly, the predicted rate and properties of such events are sensitive to the abundance and distribution of strong lensing objects which directly depends on cosmological models. One such scenario posits the existence of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) in the early universe, which would enhance the formation of dark matter halos. This mechanism has been proposed to explain the abundance of high-redshift galaxies observed by James Webb Space Telescope. Crucially, the same cosmological model with SMPBHs would also leave a distinct imprint on the population of strongly lensed GWs. It predicts both an increased event rate and a modified distribution of time delays between the multiple images. Therefore, we propose statistical measurements of the rate and time delay distribution of strong lensing GW events as a powerful probe to directly constrain the abundance of SMPBHs. Considering $\Lambda$CDM cosmology with (non-)clustered SMPBHs, we find that the abundance of SMPBHs $f_{\rm PBH}$ with masses above $10^8~M_{\odot}$ is constrained to be $\sim10^{-4}$ at $95\%$ confidence level. It will be comparable and complementary to the currently available constraint from large scale structure observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One-dimensional PIC Simulation of Induced Compton Scattering in Magnetized Electron-Positron Pair Plasma</a><span class="id">[2601.01169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate induced Compton scattering of a circularly polarized Alfvén wave propagating in a magnetized electron-positron pair plasma using one-dimensional Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations. In this system, two distinct modes of density fluctuations, referred to as the charged mode and the neutral mode, are theoretically expected to arise through parametric instabilities. Our simulations confirm these predictions: in the charged mode, the electron and positron densities fluctuate oppositely (Langmuir-like), while in the neutral mode, the charge is Debye-screened and both species fluctuate in phase (acoustic-like). The linear growth rates obtained from the simulations are in good agreement with analytical estimates for both modes. We also find that, in some cases, the linear growth saturates before full scattering occurs, allowing the incident wave to propagate without significant attenuation. Our results allow us to determine whether induced Compton scattering grows linearly in magnetized pair plasmas, offering a foundation for studies of fast radio bursts and laser-plasma experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exo-Geoscience Perspectives Beyond Habitability</a><span class="id">[2601.01177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This article reviews the emerging field of exo-geoscience, focusing on the geological and geophysical processes thought to influence the evolution and (eu)habitability of rocky exoplanets. We examine the possible roles of planetary interiors, tectonic regimes, continental coverage, volatile cycling, magnetic fields, and atmospheric composition and evolution in shaping long-term climate stability and biospheric potential. Comparisons with Earth and other planets in the Solar System highlight the diversity of planetary conditions and the rarity of conditions relevant to life. We also discuss contingency and convergence in planetary and biological evolution as they relate to the spread of life in the universe. The observational limits of current and planned missions are assessed, emphasizing the need for models that connect internal dynamics to detectable atmospheric and surface signatures as well as the need for laboratory measurements of planetary properties under a wide range of conditions. The large number of exoplanets promises opportunities for empirical and statistical studies of processes that may have occurred earlier in Earth's history, as well as of the other pathways rocky planets and biospheres may take. Thus, exo-geoscience provides a framework for interpreting exoplanet diversity and refining strategies for detecting life beyond the Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective dark matter component presents a robust signature of negative pressure by the DESI observations</a><span class="id">[2601.01340]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Comprehensive cosmological analysis of an effective non-standard dark matter(NSDM) model, characterized by an equation of state $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = w_2 a^2$, which allows for mild deviations from the previously assumed pressureless cold dark matter, is elaborated in the present work. This effective description framework is the scenarios that matter contents coupled to three distinct single-parameter dynamical dark energy models: i.e, the thawing scalar field, the Modified Emergent Dark Energy(MEDE) scenario, and the constant-$w$ model. We constrain these frameworks by using the latest cosmological probes, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background(CMB) distance priors, the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation(BAO) measurements from the Data Release 2 of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI), and three compilations of Type Ia Supernovae(SN Ia) namely the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) compilation, the Union3 compilation, and the PantheonPlus (PP) sample. Across all three dark energy scenarios and all dataset combinations, we find a consistent preference for negative values of the parameter $w_2$. Furthermore, this result is robust against the choice of dark energy parametrization, suggesting a model-independent deviation from &quot;standard&quot; cold dark matter. This result indicates that the dark matter fluid possesses a small but non-vanishing negative pressure, meaning a non-cold nature. While the inferred Hubble constant $H_0$ remains consistent with the Planck $\Lambda$CDM value and does not fully alleviate the $H_0$ tension with local measurements, the persistent detection of $w_2 &lt; 0$ across a wide range of independent cosmological probes provides compelling evidence for new physics in the dark matter sector – suggesting that dark matter may be better described as an effective fluid endowed with a mild negative pressure, rather than as a perfectly cold, pressureless substance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of 14 Years of X-Ray Emission From SN 2011DH</a><span class="id">[2601.01365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ejecta from core-collapse supernovae interact with the circumstellar medium shed by the progenitor star, producing X-ray emission. Previous studies analyzed the X-ray spectrum of the Type IIb supernova SN 2011dh up to 500 days after explosion. Long-term monitoring of X-ray emission provides valuable constraints on supernova evolution and progenitor systems, yet such studies remain rare for Type IIb events due to limited data. Here we present the most comprehensive X-ray light curve of SN 2011dh to date, combining all available Chandra and XMM-Newton data with previously published and newly released Swift observations, extending coverage to 5100 days. We measure a luminosity decline proportional to t$^{-0.74 \pm 0.04}$ and infer a mass-loss rate of $(1.0-2.2) \times 10^{-6}$ solar masses per year for $v_w = 10$ km/s, or $(2.0-4.4) \times 10^{-6} $ solar masses per year for $v_w = 20$ km/s. These estimates agree with earlier results, supporting the interpretation that the X-ray emission has been dominated by an adiabatic reverse shock. The consistency of our late-time results with previous studies demonstrates that SN 2011dh has evolved steadily for nearly 14 years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classifying Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Waves using Supervised Contrastive Learning</a><span class="id">[2601.01376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection and reconstruction of gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae (CCSN) present significant challenges due to the highly stochastic nature of the signals and the complexity of detector noise. In this work, we introduce a deep learning framework utilizing a ResNet-50 encoder pre-trained via supervised contrastive learning to classify CCSN signals and distinguish them from instrumental noise artifacts. Our approach explicitly optimizes the feature space to maximize intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Using a simulated four-detector network (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA) and realistic datasets injecting magnetorotational and neutrino-driven waveforms, we demonstrate that the contrastive learning paradigm establishes a superior metric structure within the embedding space, significantly enhancing detection efficiency. At a false positive rate of $10^{-4}$, our method achieves a true positive rate (TPR) of nearly $100\%$ for both rotational and neutrino-driven signals within a distance range of $10$–$200$ kpc, while maintaining a TPR of approximately $80\%$ at $1200$ kpc. In contrast, traditional end-to-end methods yield a TPR below $20\%$ for rotational signals at distances $\geq 200$ kpc, and fail to exceed $60\%$ for neutrino-driven signals even at a close proximity of $10$ kpc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A refined model of secondary photon emission from heavy WIMP annihilations in the Galactic Centre</a><span class="id">[2601.01397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Heavy Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) remain a prominent yet less constrained dark matter (DM) candidate, with the Galactic Centre (GC) serving as a prime target for indirect detection via gamma-ray signals. Extending our previous work that highlighted the significance of secondary inverse Compton (IC) emission from annihilation-produced electrons, we expand the analysis to a broader range of WIMP masses and introduce a more realistic spatially-dependent modelling framework for the GC environment. This approach incorporates complexities such as the three-dimensional DM distribution, spatially varying radiation and magnetic fields, and electron transport mechanisms like Galactic winds and diffusion. We assess the impact of these environmental factors on both the spatial and spectral characteristics of the resulting secondary emissions. Our results demonstrate the robustness and necessity of incorporating this emission, and highlight its role in enhancing the prospects for detecting heavy WIMPs through observations of the inner Galaxy. We provide the resulting data products to the community to support future analyses and observational studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binary neutron star mergers with SPHINCS_BSSN: temperature-dependent equations of state and damping of constraint violations</a><span class="id">[2601.01402]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron star mergers hold the key to several grand challenges of contemporary (astro-)physics. In view of the upcoming next generation of ground-based detectors, it is crucial to keep improving theoretical predictions to harvest the full scientific returns from these investments. We introduce here a substantial update of our Lagrangian numerical relativity code SPHINCS_BSSN. Apart from changing our unit system, we add constraint damping terms to the BSSN spacetime evolution equations. We demonstrate that this measure reduces, without noteworthy computational cost, the Hamiltonian constraint violations by more than an order of magnitude. We further implement contributions to thermal energy and pressure that are based on Fermi liquid theory and contain a parametrization of the Dirac effective mass. These terms can be combined with any cold equation of state, and they enhance the physical realism of our simulations and introduce a physics-based concept of a temperature. In a set of merger simulations, we demonstrate good agreement with other temperature-dependent numerical relativity simulations. We find that different parametrizations of the Dirac effective mass can translate into shifts of $\sim 150$ Hz in the dominant post-merger gravitational wave peak frequency.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trajectory-Based Dust Evolution in Disks: First Results from the RAPID Simulation Code</a><span class="id">[2601.01468]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid depletion of dust particles in protoplanetary disks limits the time available for planetesimal formation, as solids are typically accreted onto the central star before dust particles can undergo substantial growth. Dust traps formed at sharp viscosity transitions $-$ such as at the edges of the accretionally inactive dead zones $-$ can halt radial drift and enhance dust coagulation. In this study, dust dynamics is investigated using \texttt{RAPID}, a one-dimensional Lagrangian-Eulerian simulation code that tracks representative particle trajectories over time. In order to explore the effect of physical parameters on dust evolution, a grid of 243 models was run. The simulation grid covers a range of parameters such as viscosity, width of the transition region at the edges of the dead zone, disk surface density exponent, and the collisional fragmentation velocity of the dust particles. The computational domain extends from 1 to 50 AU and covers $5\times10^5$ years of disk evolution, assuming a disk mass of $\sim 0.005\,M_\odot$. The results show that pressure maxima can trap up to $3-10\,M_\oplus$ of dust, depending on the local disk conditions. However, increasing the fragmentation velocity, decreasing the viscosity, or widening the dead zone transition width tends to reduce the effectiveness of dust trapping. The simulation results with \texttt{RAPID} reveal that dust evolution is highly sensitive to the physical conditions of the disk, which governs the early stages of planetesimal growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indication of the Less-ionized Clumpy Ultra-Fast Outflows in Seyfert Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.01509]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic investigation of X-ray spectral variability of Seyfert 1 galaxies using a “spectral-ratio model fitting” technique, which we developed to estimate contribution of the putative clumpy absorbers to the spectral variations. Archival XMM-Newton observations of 12 active galactic nuclei were analyzed to constrain properties of these absorbers. Our analysis demonstrates that the soft X-ray variability is primarily governed by fluctuation of the partial covering fraction of mildly ionized clumpy clouds. In particular, for Mrk 335, PDS 456, and 1H 0707-495, outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are constrained from the blue-shifts of the Fe-L edge structure. The blue-shifted Fe-L edge successfully reproduces the well-known complex spectral feature near 1 keV in 1H 0707–495, which was often explained by invoking an ad hoc absorption structure. Notably, the inferred outflow velocities of the clumpy absorbers are comparable to, or even exceed, those associated with the Ultra-Fast Outflows (UFOs). Furthermore, we found a positive correlation between the outflow velocities and the intrinsic X-ray fluxes in two of four data sets, and the remaining two datasets also agree with this positive correlation, which supports a radiative-driven wind scenario that the X-ray/UV emission from the central black holes is causing the UFOs and the outflowing clumpy absorbers. In addition, the line-driven acceleration is likely playing a significant role, since the line opacities of the clumpy absorbers are highly sensitive to the flux changes. These findings provide a robust observational support for the “hot inner and clumpy outer wind” paradigm, suggesting a common origin for both the UFOs and the clumpy absorbers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cracks in the Standard Cosmological Model: Anomalies, Tensions, and Hints of New Physics</a><span class="id">[2601.01525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmology has entered an era of unprecedented precision, yet increasing accuracy has revealed cracks in the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.

Close to the central black hole, protons can be accelerated through magnetic reconnection to very high energies and subsequently interact with abundant X-ray photons in the source, leading to neutrino production. We investigate whether the diffuse neutrino flux observed by IceCube can originate, via proton acceleration, in reconnection-powered coronae of non-jetted AGN. We create a library of neutrino spectral templates, over a large grid of values for the three key model parameters: the proton plasma magnetization of the corona $\sigma_{\rm p}$, the X-ray coronal luminosity, and the black hole mass. Synchrotron cooling of pions and muons plays a significant role due to the large coronal magnetic fields. We couple the single-source model with a mock AGN catalog, consistent with the observed X-ray and mid-infrared AGN samples at redshifts $z=0-4$, to infer the diffuse neutrino flux. Coronal emission satisfactorily explains the most recent IceCube measurements of the diffuse neutrino flux up to energies of $\sim 1$ PeV, provided that $\sim$10\% of the AGN coronae have $\sigma_{\rm p} \sim 10^5$, while the rest are distributed over a range of lower magnetizations. Coronal emission is suppressed at higher energies by pion and muon cooling, so that another population is required, with jetted AGN being strong candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio counterparts of ultraluminous X-ray sources in nearby galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.01540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio surveys of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) allow us to find supercritically accreting compact objects (SS 433/W50 like systems) or stripped nuclear black holes in nearby galaxies. We identified 21 such objects by crossmatching a ULX catalog with the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) and Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). They may have a diverse population. (i) Three have a double lobed radio structure with a compact core found in two of them, and could be quasars. (ii) Five are associated with extended radio structure and star forming regions in optical, where the radio emission is likely due to star forming activities, although the steep radio spectrum up to several GHz casts doubt on that. Two of them show X-ray variability suggesting that they are ULXs embedded in star forming regions. (iii) Thirteen are associated with an unresolved radio source, with a steep spectrum seen in eight, a flat or inverted spectrum seen in two. Those with a steep spectrum are arguably candidates for SS 433/W50 like objects, with radio emission due to optically thin synchrotron radiation in a surrounding jet/wind powered nebula. Remarkable cases include NGC 925 ULX1 and NGC 6946 ULX1, which are associated with an optical nebula. Those with a flat or inverted spectrum could be accreting black holes with a compact jet, while the black hole mass is estimated to be several $10^6 - 10^8$ $M_\odot$ based on the fundamental plane. Redshift measurements are needed to firmly determine the association with their apparent host galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of giant pulses from the transitional millisecond pulsar J1227$-$4853</a><span class="id">[2601.01563]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of giant pulse (GP) emission from the transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) PSR J1227$-$4853, using 174 hours of single-pulse data from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). This marks the first detection of GPs from a transitional MSP and adds to the small number of millisecond pulsars known to exhibit such extreme variability. A total of 235 GPs were detected across observations at 550-750 MHz, with widths as narrow as $1.28~\mu s$ and flux densities up to $\sim 10^4$ times the pulsar's mean flux density. The GPs are strongly localized in pulse phase, originating predominantly from the second and third main-pulse components, and are absent in the inter-pulse region. The arrival times of the GPs deviate significantly from Poisson statistics, with the waiting-time distribution well described by a Weibull model having a shape parameter of $k = 0.30$, indicative of strong temporal clustering. During an epoch of enhanced activity, the GP rate increased by nearly two orders of magnitude to $124~\mathrm{hr}^{-1}$, with a corresponding shape parameter of $k = 0.47$. This value is similar to that reported for a burst storm from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20200120E, suggesting possible phenomenological parallels between GPs from compact binary systems and repeating FRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical analysis of multi-band plateaus in gamma-ray burst afterglows</a><span class="id">[2601.01586]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Plateau features are frequently observed in the afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), yet their physical origins remain under debate. In this work, we compile a sample of 124 GRBs with known redshifts and simultaneous X-ray and optical afterglow observations. We categorize them into four subsets based on the existence of plateaus and the bands in which they appear. Namely, Dataset 1: plateaus are detected simultaneously in both X-ray and optical bands (75 bursts); Dataset 2: plateaus are only in X-rays (15 bursts); Dataset 3: plateaus appear only in the optical (17 bursts); Dataset 4: no plateaus in either band (17 bursts). We employ these datasets to test the applicability of the energy-injection model by examining whether the temporal decay index $\alpha$ and the spectral index $\beta$ of GRB afterglows simultaneously satisfy the closure relations in X-ray and optical bands. We find that 47 bursts of Dataset 1 simultaneously obey the closure relations in both bands under the conditions of the electron spectral index $p&gt;2$ and the injection parameter $q\in (0, 0.5)$, and 69 of the dataset for $p&gt;1$ and $q\in (0, 0.8)$, providing a strong support for the energy-injection interpretation. However, for Datasets 2 and 3, although $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of the plateaus mostly satisfy the closure relations, those in the other band show significant deviations, which implies that bursts with a single-band plateau are inconsistent with the interpretation of energy injection. Furthermore, we also compare the isotropic X-ray energy of plateaus with the rotational energy budget of millisecond magnetars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01614" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Optical Origin of the Mass-Sheet Transformation</a><span class="id">[2601.01614]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In gravitational lensing, the Mass-Sheet Transformation (MST)-or mass-sheet degeneracy-leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays.

Here I show that the MST follows directly from a scaling symmetry that becomes apparent when the ray-trace relation is written in proper-distance coordinates. In this form, the ray-trace relation isolates a geometric focusing term. Subtracting this term from the deflection law defines the Image-Selection Relation (ISR), which determines image positions, magnifications, and differential time delays. The ISR exhibits a scaling symmetry that leaves image positions unchanged while scaling magnifications and time delays.

We find that the JWST target planets almost all experience much stronger ultraviolet fluxes than the Earth, especially in the extreme ultraviolet, even for planets with similar overall instellation.

Evolutionary models are calculated using the \mesa stellar evolution code with a custom accretion routine and pulsation properties are investigated using the \GYRE oscillation code. We present evolutionary tracks and internal structures for accreting pre-main sequence solar-like stars in the mass range from 0.7 to 1.6 solar masses, adopting 35 mass accretion histories previously extracted from two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Atmospheric parameters of our models constrain characteristic frequencies of pre-main sequence solar-like oscillators to be generally greater than 500 $\mu\text{Hz}$. We highlight the imprint of accretion on the buoyancy and Lamb profiles and illustrate the effects on the small- and large frequency separations. We additionally quantify individual frequency differences across the 35 accretion histories at the zero-age main-sequence, showcasing differences no larger than $20 \ \mu\text{Hz}$ for an exemplary model. Finally, we discuss the potential of detecting solar-like oscillations in pre-main sequence stars with the upcoming ESA PLATO mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoding Cygnus X-2: The Critical Role of Reflection in IXPE Data</a><span class="id">[2601.01669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a spectro-polarimetric re-analysis of the first IXPE observation of Cygnus X-2 which we determine to be mainly in the normal branch, from quasi-simultaneous observations with NuSTAR, NICER, and INTEGRAL.

Leveraging NuSTAR's detection of both the relativistic Fe K emission line and the Compton hump, we constrain the flux contribution of the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk to be 10% of the total X-ray flux in the IXPE energy band. Unlike previous studies that modeled only the Fe K emission line, we fit the full-band reflection spectrum using a fully relativistic disk model. There is strong degeneracy between the Comptonized and reflection components. Given that the Comptonized component is not expected to be highly polarized, a polarization degree of approximately 20% for the reflection component could explain the X-ray polarization data from IXPE.

Different modes of oscillations are frequently observed in solar prominences/filaments, and prominence seismology helps estimate important physical parameters like the magnetic field strength. Although the simultaneous detection of longitudinal and transverse oscillations in the same filament is not common, such rare observations provide a unique opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of interest. Aims. In this study, we aim to estimate the physical parameters of prominences undergoing simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations. Methods. We apply Bayesian seismology techniques to observations of longitudinal and transverse filament oscillations to infer the magnetic field strength, the length, and the number of twists in the flux tube holding the prominence plasma. We first use the observations of longitudinal oscillations and the pendulum model to infer the posterior probability density for the magnetic field strength. The obtained marginal posterior of the magnetic field, combined with the observations of the transverse oscillations, is then used to estimate the probable values of the length of the magnetic flux tube that supports the filament material using Bayesian inference. This estimated length is used to compute the number of twists in the flux tube. Results. For the prominences under study, we find that the length of the flux tubes supporting the quiescent prominences can be very large (from 100 to 1000 Mm) and the number of twists in the flux tube are not more than three. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian analysis offers valuable methods to perform parameter inference in the context of prominence seismology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light curve modeling of the nearest neutron star candidate LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9</a><span class="id">[2601.01755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of heavy radioactive elements (e.g., $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$) on Earth suggests that supernova explosions may have occurred near our planet within the past million years, potentially having a significant impact on the ecological environment. This finding has motivated the search for nearby neutron stars in the Solar neighborhood. In a recent study, a candidate for one of the closest neutron stars to Earth, LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9 (hereafter J2354), was reported. Based on dynamical mass measurements under different inclination angle assumptions, the inferred mass range for the unseen compact companion in the system is $1.4$–$1.6$ $M_{\odot}$. Hence, the unseen companion in J2354 is either a massive cold white dwarf or a neutron star. Here we model the flux variations of J2354 as a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and surface spots. We test both cold spot and hot spot models, setting the number of spots to two in each case, and constrain the spot properties through light curve fitting. In the cold spot scenario, the spots are mostly visible at phases $0.5$–$0.75$, whereas in the hot spot scenario, the spots appear predominantly at phases $0.25$–$0.5$. The hot spot model shows better agreement with the observed H$\alpha$ phase variation than the cold spot model. Furthermore, the thermal radiation of a massive but cold white dwarf cannot produce the level of localized heating required to explain the hot spot unless additional heating mechanisms are involved; in contrast, a neutron star can naturally provide such heating through energetic winds. Our results are consistent with the neutron star interpretation of the compact object in J2354.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new solar radiation pressure model for some orbit types in the cislunar space</a><span class="id">[2601.01775]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For satellites in the cislunar space, solar radiation pressure (SRP) is the third largest perturbation, which is only less significant than the lunisolar gravity perturbations.

In this study, we concentrate on various scenarios of cislunar satellites in periodic or quasi-periodic orbits. We first employ the box-wing model to simulate the SRP effects and then propose an appropriate general SRP model based on these simulations, termed Empirical NJU Cislunar Model (ENCM). Additionally, several scenario-specific sub-models suited to different mission profiles are developed. Furthermore, the proposed model is verified in the orbit determination process.

To understand what determines the timing of such a secondary peak in the H$\alpha$ light curve associated with postflare loops, we must quantitatively identify the key physical processes controlling the appearance of H$\alpha$ postflare loops. Previous case studies have indicated that the appearance timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops is likely governed by radiative cooling. However, the statistical characteristics of the timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops appearance remain insufficiently investigated. In this study, we statistically investigated the appearance timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops to quantify their cooling processes. As a result, we found a negative correlation between the time difference between the soft X-ray peak and the appearance of the H$\alpha$ postflare loops ($\Delta t$) and the soft X-ray peak flux ($F_\mathrm{X}$). This relationship is consistent with the theoretical scaling between radiative cooling timescale ($\tau_{\mathrm{rad}}$) and $F_\mathrm{X}$, where $\tau_{\mathrm{rad}} \propto~F_\mathrm{X}^{-1/2}$. This statistical result indicates that the appearance timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops relative to the soft X-ray peak is primarily controlled by radiative cooling. Furthermore, we examined the dependence of the scaling law on flare spatial scales ($L$). Consequently, we demonstrated that spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares can be estimated using the following scaling law: $L\propto F_\mathrm{X}^{1/3}\Delta t^{2/3}$. Our results are useful for interpreting secondary peaks in the H$\alpha$ data of stellar flares and provide new method to estimate spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar Gleaners: Discovery of 19 Pulsars in FAST Archival Data at $|b|&lt;5°$ and Decl.$&lt;-5°$</a><span class="id">[2601.01912]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of 19 new pulsars identified from archival observations of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) within Galactic latitudes $|b|&lt;5°$ and declinations ${\rm Decl.}&lt;-5°$.

Our search employed fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based and fast folding algorithm (FFA)-based periodic searches, and the single-pulse search. These new pulsars have spin periods range from 0.03 to 5.54 s. Two have periods under 0.1 s, suggesting they are likely young pulsars or mildly recycled pulsars. Four pulsars exhibit dispersion measures (DMs) exceeding $1000~{\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$ with PSR J1839$-$0558t having the highest value in our sample at $\sim 1271~{\rm pc~cm^{-3}}$, providing valuable samples for pulsar studies in the high-DM regime. Two rotating radio transients, PSRs J1836$-$0552t and J1847$-$0624t, were detected by FFA and single-pulse searches but failed with the FFT-based searches. In addition, three faint pulsars that were also missed by FFT-based searches were successfully detected using FFA. These discoveries demonstrate the critical role of FFA in uncovering faint, long-period, and sporadic pulsars, and highlight the significant potential of FAST archival data, especially when combined with longer integration times and complementary search techniques, to reveal rare and weak pulsar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dilaton: A Natural Resolution to the Hubble Tension via Spontaneous Scale Symmetry Breaking</a><span class="id">[2601.01938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The statistical tension between early and late universe measurements of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) suggests that the dark sector is dynamical rather than static. We propose that this dynamics arises from a fundamental symmetry principle: the Spontaneous Breaking of Scale Invariance. We introduce the Dilaton ($\chi$), a Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Boson (PNGB) associated with dilatation symmetry breaking. We demonstrate that a simple quadratic mass term in the fundamental theory transforms, via conformal coupling to gravity, into a ”thawing” exponential potential $V(\phi) \propto e^{-\lambda\phi}$ in the Einstein frame. Using recent Bayesian reconstructions of dark energy dynamics from Planck, Pantheon+, and SH0ES data, we constrain the potential slope to be $\lambda \approx 0.056$. We show that this observational value is not arbitrary but corresponds to a fundamental non-minimal coupling strength of $\xi \approx 7.8 \times 10^{-4}$. The Dilaton mechanism naturally generates the late-time equation of state evolution ($w_0 \approx -0.85$) required to alleviate the Hubble tension while protecting the field mass $m \sim H_0$ through approximate shift symmetry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strangeon Ergostars</a><span class="id">[2601.01949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of the central engine powering short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in binary neutron star (BNS) mergers remains a key open question in the era of multi-messenger astronomy. The ergostar hypothesis, that a rapidly rotating star with an ergoregion drives the relativistic jet, offers an alternative explanation to the black hole-accretion disk paradigm. However, previous studies based on conventional neutron star equations of state (EOSs) have shown that dynamically stable ergostars do not exist unless very extreme EOS or rotation are adopted, casting significant doubt on their astrophysical viability in reality. In this work, however, we examine this hypothesis using a phenomenological EOS of strangeon matter, i.e., condensed matter with nucleon-like units for three flavors of quarks. By constructing a large suite of uniformly rotating equilibrium models, we systematically investigate the parameter space of the stable ergostars and calculate their maximum extractable energy. In contrast to the case of conventional EOSs, we demonstrate that strangeon matter supports a vast and robust parameter space for dynamically stable ergostars, even without requiring differential rotation. We find that the extractable rotational energy from these configurations can be on the order of $0.01 M_\odot$, a reservoir sufficient to power a typical sGRB. Our results revitalize the ergostar as a viable central engine for sGRB, suggesting that BNS merger remnants composed of exotic matter could play a crucial, previously underestimated role in high-energy astrophysics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton Acceleration by Collisionless Shocks in Supermassive Black Hole Coronae: Implications for High-Energy Neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2601.01999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory have revealed a significant excess of high-energy neutrinos from nearby Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC 1068, without a corresponding flux of high-energy gamma-rays. This suggests that neutrinos are produced via hadronic interactions in a region opaque to gamma-rays, likely a hot corona surrounding the central supermassive black hole. However, the mechanism responsible for accelerating the parent protons to the required energies ($\sim 100$ TeV) remains an open question. In this study, we investigate diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) in active galactic nucleus (AGN) coronae using a suite of one-dimensional Particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations spanning a broad range of plasma parameters. We find that DSA is a robust and efficient mechanism for proton acceleration, consistently channeling approximately 10\% of the shock's kinetic energy into non-thermal ions, even for shocks with sonic Mach number as low as $ M_s \approx 2$. In contrast, the efficiency of electron acceleration is highly variable and less efficient ($&lt;1\%$) in our parameter survey. These findings provide strong, first-principles support for the hadronic models of neutrino production in AGN and offer quantitative constraints that can explain the observed gamma-ray deficit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: Improving redshift distribution reconstruction using a deep-to-wide transfer function</a><span class="id">[2601.02005]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Euclid mission seeks to understand the Universe expansion history and the nature of dark energy, which requires a very accurate estimate of redshift distribution. Achieving this accuracy relies on reference samples with spectroscopic redshifts, together with a procedure to match them to survey sources for which only photometric redshifts are available. One important source of systematic uncertainty is the mismatch in photometric properties between galaxies in the Euclid survey and the reference objects. We develop a method to degrade the photometry of objects with deep photometry to match the properties of any shallower survey in the multi-band photometric space, preserving all the correlations between the fluxes and their uncertainties. We compare our transfer method with more demanding image-based methods, such as Balrog from the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration. According to metrics, our method outperforms Balrog. We implement it in the redshift distribution reconstruction, based on the self-organising map approach of arXiv:1509.03318 , and test it using a realistic sample from the Euclid Flagship Simulation. We find that the key ingredient is to ensure that the reference objects are distributed in the colour space the same way as the wide-survey objects, which can be efficiently achieved with our transfer method. In our best implementation, the mean redshift biases are consistently reduced across the tomographic bins, bringing a significant fraction of them within the Euclid accuracy requirements in all tomographic bins. Equally importantly, the tests allow us to pinpoint which step in the calibration pipeline has the strongest impact on achieving the required accuracy. Our approach also reproduces the overall redshift distributions, which are crucial for applications such as angular clustering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Betelgeuse Enigma: The Betelbuddy Hypothesis</a><span class="id">[2601.02012]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past six years, Betelgeuse has been in the news and drawn significant public interest. Starting in October 2019, Betelgeuse underwent a striking dimming event, fading from magnitude 0.5 to 1.7 by mid February 2020 a threefold decrease in brightness This gave rise to a number of speculative debates that the star was on the verge of a supernova, a moment of eerie quiet before the cosmic outburst. In a previous article, the author discussed the most accepted explanation to the dimming caused by episodic mass loss that released large dust grains, which obscured Betelgeuse's light and made it appear fainter. This interpretation suggested that the dimming was not a precursor to a supernova, as Betelgeuse is likely still far from reaching that stage. On 21 July 2025, the existence of the companion star was confirmed with direct imaging, for the first time, by the alopeke instrument on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The companion is 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse and orbits close to Betelgeuse itself, within the supergiant star's extended outer atmosphere. The stellar companion was detected at an angular separation of 52 mas and a position angle of 115 deg east of north. These measurements, along with its brightness, being roughly 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm, are in excellent agreement with dynamical predictions. Although this was only a 1.5 sigma detection, the agreement in the companion's appearance, separation, position angle, magnitude difference, and estimated mass is reasonable, making the result tentatively acceptable. The next optimum period for observations is November 2027, when we hope to get better observations.

Studies of accretion-disc outflows across all mass scales, including accreting white dwarfs, X-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei, have shown that winds play a key role in regulating both the accretion flow and the surrounding environment. Disc winds therefore provide a common thread linking a broad range of scientific topics, from the microphysics of accretion to galaxy-scale feedback and evolution, as well as binary evolution and the predicted rates of energetic (multi-messenger) transient phenomena. Yet we still lack a comprehensive picture of the accretion-feedback process. Optical spectroscopy has revealed striking similarities across mass scales, hinting at common production mechanisms, and has shown that winds can evolve on timescales of only minutes. Progress, however, has been limited by their transient nature, sparse time coverage, and the lack of simultaneous, high-resolution spectroscopy. Time-domain facilities with high temporal and spectral resolution will allow us to track these events in high accretion-rate systems, constrain their launching mechanisms, and measure the mass, energy, and angular momentum they carry. This will provide crucial input for binary evolution models, wind feedback, and a unified view of accreting systems across mass scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02057" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A phoenix rises from the ashes: WOH G64 is still a red supergiant, for now</a><span class="id">[2601.02057]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For a long time, WOH G64 was known as the most extreme red supergiant outside our Galaxy.

Around the same time, a hot dust cloud was discovered using the VLT interferometer. WOH G64 has been claimed to have turned into a yellow hypergiant, which could signal a pre-supernova post-red supergiant evolution. Here we present spectra of WOH G64 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) between November 2024 and December 2025. Molecular absorption bands from TiO are seen at all times. This implies that WOH G64 is currently a red supergiant, and may never have ceased to be. However, the shallow, resolved bands and possible detection of VO hint at a highly extended atmosphere. The continuum appears to be varying, while the line emission shows a different behaviour, suggesting two separate components in the system. Meanwhile, atomic absorption lines are deepening. This places important constraints on scenarios for the dramatic events that are unfolding.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear Scales in Luminal Horndeski – I.

We compute the critical and virial overdensities and use these to evaluate the halo mass function within several commonly employed formalisms. Building on the reaction method, we develop a flexible and accurate framework for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum across a broad class of viable modified gravity models within luminal Horndeski theories. The framework interfaces seamlessly with EFTCAMB and is applicable to both covariant Horndeski models and effective field theory descriptions of dark energy, allowing for a range of background cosmologies. This approach enables systematic exploration of a wide space of theories and cosmological parameters, with the goal of informing future analyses of upcoming large-scale structure surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint Constraints on Neutrinos and Dynamical Dark Energy in Minimally Modified Gravity</a><span class="id">[2601.02077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM framework provides a theoretically well-controlled extension of \(\Lambda\)CDM within the class of minimally modified gravity theories, allowing for flexible cosmological background evolution and linear perturbation dynamics while remaining free of pathological instabilities. In this work, we have shown that this scenario remains robust when confronted with current cosmological observations, even in the presence of an extended neutrino sector. Combining \textit{Planck} CMB data with DESI DR2 BAO and DESY5 supernovae, we obtain stringent constraints on neutrino physics, including \(\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.11~\mathrm{eV}\) (95\% CL) and \(N_{\rm eff} = 2.98^{+0.13}_{-0.14}\), fully consistent with Standard Model expectations. Crucially, the data exhibit a statistically significant preference for a late-time dark-energy transition, characterized by a robust quintessence–phantom crossing that remains stable across all dataset combinations and neutrino-sector extensions, including the presence of a sterile neutrino. The combined effects of modified late-time expansion and additional relativistic degrees of freedom systematically raise the inferred Hubble constant, substantially alleviating the \(H_0\) tension without invoking early dark energy or introducing theoretical instabilities. Overall, the \(w_{\dagger}\)VCDM scenario emerges as a compelling phenomenological framework that simultaneously accommodates current constraints on neutrino physics, provides an excellent fit to recent BAO and supernovae data, and offers a viable pathway toward resolving persistent tensions in the standard cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New branch of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo in stellar radiative zones</a><span class="id">[2601.02129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent asteroseismic observations constitute a great challenge for rotating stellar evolution models, which predict too fast internal rotation rates when only hydrodynamic processes are included. This suggests the absence of one or several unidentified angular momentum transport processes in these models. Transport by large-scale and strong magnetic fields in the radiative zone is a promising candidate to explain the observations. While these fields may have a fossil origin, a dynamo driven by the Tayler instability in a shear flow constitute a primary mechanism to form the necessary magnetic fields. Despite recent numerical studies, this mechanism remains poorly known. Motivated by this, we investigate the Tayler-Spruit dynamo through a new set of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. We model the radiative zone as a Boussinesq stably stratified fluid whose differential rotation is maintained by a volumetric body force. We report for the first time the existence of two bistable dynamo branches, which mainly differ by the magnetic field location (near the equator and the polar axis). While the equatorial branch is driven by the magnetorotational instability, we mainly investigate the newly identified polar branch, which is driven by the Tayler instability. We show that this branch can still operate and transport angular momentum efficiently in a very strong stratification regime. We extract new scaling laws for the different magnetic field components, transports processes, and the minimum shear to trigger the Tayler instability-driven dynamo. Finally, we roughly constrain the signature of the generated magnetic fields on asteroseismic modes propagating in main-sequence and evolved stars. Thus, our results fosters new studies using stellar evolution models including our prescriptions and the search of asteroseismic signals impacted by large-scale azimuthal magnetic fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on sunspot group lifetimes from far-side Sun-as-a-star helioseismology with BiSON</a><span class="id">[2601.02153]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Frequencies of low-degree solar p modes are sensitive to activity over the entire Sun, including the unobservable far-side hemisphere. When frequency shifts extracted from week-long BiSON datasets are fitted to a linear combination of observed near-side activity and a far-side proxy made from the near-side measures shifted by half the solar rotation period, the solution favours a slightly higher weighting from the far-side contribution. Here, we demonstrate that this unphysical mismatch is due to the inherent inaccuracy of the far-side proxy, which fails to capture active regions that evolve fully on the solar far side, or that evolve (or have evolved) significantly as they rotate off (or onto) the visible disc. By simulating the evolution of sunspot group areas over time, which act as a suitable measure of solar activity, we show that the solution is sensitive to the lifetime of the activity. Assuming an underlying mapping from maximum group areas $A_{\rm max}$ (measured in millionths of the solar hemispheric area, MSH) to group lifetimes $\tau$ (measured in days) of the form $\tau = \alpha A_{\rm max}$, we find that $\alpha \simeq 0.025^{+0.055}_{-0.016}\,\rm d\,MSH^{-1}$ gives results consistent with the BiSON finding. This is to be compared with the value of $\alpha = 0.1\,\rm d\,MSH^{-1}$ implied by the well-known Gnevyshev-Waldmeier rule. While our best-fitting $\alpha$ maps to an average group lifetime of $\tau \simeq 5^{+10}_{-3}\,\rm d$, the best-fitting distribution includes a reasonable fraction of groups with lifetimes longer than the solar rotation period, which is essential to reproducing the mismatch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST/MIRI coronagraphic search for planets in systems with gapped exoKuiper belts and proper motion anomalies</a><span class="id">[2601.02156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decade, ALMA has uncovered a range of substructures within exoKuiper belts, pointing to a population of undetected planets. With JWST's sensitivity, we now have the opportunity to identify these planets thought to be responsible for the observed substructures in debris discs. We present Cycle 1 JWST/MIRI 11.4 {\mu}m coronagraphic observations of three exoKuiper belts that exhibit gaps in their radial structures: HD 92945, HD 107146, and HD 206893, to determine whether planets are responsible for carving these structures, as seen in our Solar System with the gas giants. We reduce the JWST/MIRI data using spaceKLIP, and introduce new routines to mitigate the Brighter-Fatter effect and persistence. We do not detect any planet candidates, and all detected objects in the field-of-view are consistent with background stars or galaxies. However, by combining JWST mass limits, archival observational constraints, and astrometric accelerations, we rule out a significant portion of planet parameter space, placing tight constraints on the planets possibly responsible for these gaps. To interpret these results, we explore multiple gap-carving scenarios in discs, either massless or with non-zero mass, including clearing by in-situ planet(s), as well as shaping by inner planets through mean-motion or secular apsidal resonances. Finally, we conclude that the planets causing the proper motion anomaly in these systems must reside within the inner 20 au.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02171" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical Vetting of the Ultra-Short-Period Sub-Earth TOI 864.01</a><span class="id">[2601.02171]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive analysis of TOI 864.01, a transit-like signal associated with the M-dwarf TIC 231728511. Utilizing the full baseline of TESS photometry (54 sectors), we recover a periodic signal with $P = 0.52067$ d and a shallow depth of $\sim$158 ppm. To assess the planetary nature of the candidate, we performed a rigorous vetting process combining centroid analysis, Bayesian model comparison, and false-positive probability calculations. While the low signal-to-noise ratio of the sub-Earth candidate yielded inconclusive formal statistical validation metrics (FPP) and Bayesian evidence ($\Delta \ln Z$), we demonstrate the planetary nature of the system through physical exclusion of false positive scenarios. The TRICERATOPS Nearby False Positive Probability (NFPP) of 0.0000, combined with centroid stability, rules out background contamination. Furthermore, we calculate that a stellar-mass companion at the derived orbital separation ($a \approx 5 R_\star$) would induce ellipsoidal variations of order $\gtrsim 5000$ ppm. The absence of such variations in the TESS photometry ($&lt; 200$ ppm limit) physically precludes stellar binary scenarios.

The recently observed Tayler-Spruit dynamo has been invoked to explain angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones and magnetar formation in a proto-neutron star spun-up by fallback accretion. Whether this dynamo mechanism can lead to different dynamical regimes remains an open question. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the dynamics of a stably stratified spherical Couette flow, with the outer sphere rotating faster than the inner one. While the generation of strong stationary and hemispherical dynamos has been observed in our previous studies, we report for the first time the existence of reversals and complex temporal dynamics. We observe that the dynamics is strongly correlated with the equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow. Focusing on a fiducial dynamo simulation, we propose a simple interpretation of its dynamics, which consists in the coupling of two large-scale magnetic modes with two opposite equatorial symmetries by the flow symmetry breaking. While this interpretation captures the simplest observed dynamics, the nonlinear interaction between a higher number of magnetic modes is certainly required to describe some of the more complex regimes. The wide diversity of dynamical regimes generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may have interesting implications for the geometry of the neutron star magnetic fields, and therefore neutron star emissions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral signatures of bright grains determine chromospheric heating</a><span class="id">[2601.02191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Chromospheric heating is an important ingredient in the energy budget of the solar atmosphere, which is challenging to quantify from observations. By using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere combined with non-LTE spectral synthesis, we estimated chromospheric heating from synthetic spectra and studied the spectral and temporal signatures of heating events. We performed k-means clustering on the Mg II h, Ca II H, and Ca II 8542 Å lines to identify representative profiles associated with elevated chromospheric heating and studied their atmospheric stratification. We find that locations with the strongest chromospheric heating show spectral signatures with strong emission. Profiles with strong emission in the blue wing of the lines (blue grains) are created by upward-propagating shock waves and have an order of magnitude higher heating in the chromosphere than the ambient heating. Profiles with strong emission in the red wing (red grains) also display heating that is an order of magnitude stronger than the baseline, but these spectra do not show a characteristic atmospheric stratification. Spectra classified as blue grains have a consistent temporal evolution, which is an oscillating sawtooth pattern in the line core and emission in the blue wing. However, spectra classified as red grains did not show a consistent temporal signature: Red wing emission from the simulations can appear spontaneously or be associated with an oscillation. While red and blue grain profiles account for around 3% of our synthetic spectra, they account for more than 12% of the total chromospheric heating in these simulations. By comparing two quiet Sun simulations, we find that the prevalence of bright grains is influenced by the magnetic field configuration, with a unipolar configuration showing fewer bright grains and consequently a lower share of heating from such events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 500 pc volume-limited sample of hot subluminous stars II. Atmospheric parameters, mass distribution, and kinematics</a><span class="id">[2601.02250]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a quantitative spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of a volume-complete sample of hot subluminous stars within 500 pc of the Sun, assembled using accurate parallax measurements from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). In total, 3226 spectra of 253 hot subdwarf stars were analysed to derive atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and helium abundance) and radial velocities. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) combined with Gaia parallaxes were used to measure stellar radii, luminosities, and masses. The derived atmospheric parameters reveal a consistent alignment between sdB and sdO stars in the Kiel diagram when compared to theoretical evolutionary models. We identify a population (about 10%) of hot subdwarfs located below the 0.45 Msun zero-age EHB in both the Kiel and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, which likely originate from intermediate-mass progenitors (1.8-8 Msun). The overall mass distribution peaks at 0.48 pm 0.12 Msun, while hot subdwarfs below the EHB peak at 0.43 pm 0.10 Msun, supporting non- or semi-degenerate helium ignition characteristic of intermediate-mass stars. Interpolation of EHB and post-EHB tracks yields mass distributions consistent with those derived from SEDs and parallaxes. Assuming a mass range between 0.40 and 0.50 Msun, we find that the post-EHB birthrate is 2-3 times higher than the EHB birthrate, suggesting overestimated EHB lifetimes or contamination from additional formation channels. Our kinematic analysis shows that 86 pm 2% of the stars belong to the Galactic thin disk, with 13 pm 1% and 1 pm 1% associated with the thick disk and halo. The below-EHB population is found exclusively in the thin disk, the only Galactic component young enough to host intermediate-mass progenitors. Its absence from other large samples suggests that non-degenerate formation channels play a more prominent role in the Galactic disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stellar Winds Atlas I: Current uncertainties in mass-loss rates</a><span class="id">[2601.02263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar winds are a major source of uncertainty in understanding the life and deaths of massive stars. Across studies in the field, prescriptions for stellar winds differ substantially in both their physical assumptions and implementation, making them a dominant contributor to model-to-model variation. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the physical assumptions underlying commonly adopted wind prescriptions for optically thin and optically thick winds of hot stars, as well as the winds of cool supergiants. Our analysis reveals substantial discrepancies across all regimes: predicted mass-loss rates for optically thin winds differ by more than an order of magnitude, while rates for cool supergiants vary by several orders of magnitude, with even wider uncertainties arising in extrapolation regimes beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit. These disparities introduce significant ambiguity into the predicted formation of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, a problem further compounded by the inconsistent application of transition criteria. A central issue is the &quot;cool Wolf-Rayet problem&quot;, a temperature regime where the classical electron-scattering Eddington factor ($\Gamma_{\rm e}$) loses physical consistency. Because this factor is widely used to determine WR mass-loss rates, its failure forces models to rely on uncertain extrapolations and ad-hoc corrections. We conclude that the dominant stellar wind uncertainties arise from a mismatch between the physical assumptions in stellar wind models and the structure of the stars to which they are applied. Our framework clarifies the origins of current theoretical discrepancies and identifies the key physical bottlenecks that must be addressed to improve mass-loss modeling for massive stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quintom Dark Energy: Future Attractor and Phantom Crossing in Light of DESI DR2 Observation</a><span class="id">[2601.02284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a two-field dark energy model consisting of a canonical quintessence scalar field and a phantom scalar field in a spatially flat FLRW universe. The fields are minimally coupled to gravity and uncoupled at the level of the potential, with the quintessence sector governed by an exponential potential and the phantom sector by an inverse power-law potential. By reformulating the background equations as a five-dimensional autonomous dynamical system, we identify and analyze the fixed points and their stability properties, revealing stable late-time attractors corresponding to phantom-dominated accelerated expansion. We confront the model with observations through a Bayesian parameter estimation performed using the \textsc{Cobaya} framework, employing several combinations of recent cosmological data sets, including Pantheon+ supernovae, compressed cosmic microwave background distance priors, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements, and DES Year-5 supernova data. The observational constraints favor a dynamical dark energy sector moderately and are consistent with deviations from a cosmological constant at the present epoch. The regions of parameter space preferred by the data are compatible with the stable accelerating solutions identified in the dynamical analysis, establishing a direct connection between phase-space stability and observational viability.

Using Gaia coordinates, parallaxes, and proper motions, we compute peculiar velocities ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$) relative to Galactic disc rotation. Remaining agnostic about radial velocities (RVs), we vary RVs to find the minimum possible $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec}$ values ($\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$). Uncertainties on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}$ are estimated via Monte Carlo resampling, and we select X-ray sources that have $1\,\sigma$ lower limits on $\upsilon_\mathrm{pec, min}\geq 200\,\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$ and high $F_\mathrm{X}/F_\mathrm{G}$ values.

Disks with a central deficit in dust emission, a &quot;cavity&quot;, have long attracted interest as potential evidence for advanced disk clearing by protoplanets and/or winds. Before JWST, infrared spectra showed that these disks typically lack the strong molecular emission observed in full disks. In this work, we combine a sample of 12 disks with millimeter cavities of a range of sizes ($\sim2$-70 au) and different levels of millimeter and infrared continuum deficits. We analyze their molecular spectra as observed with MIRI on JWST, homogeneously reduced with the new JDISCS pipeline. This analysis demonstrates a stark dichotomy in molecular emission where &quot;molecule-rich&quot; (MR) cavities follow global trends between water, CO, and OH luminosity and accretion luminosity as in full disks, while &quot;molecule-poor&quot; (MP) cavities are significantly sub-luminous in all molecules except sometimes OH. Disk cavities generally show sub-luminous organic emission, higher OH/H$_2$O ratios, and suggest a lower water column density. The sub-thermal excitation of CO and water vibrational lines suggests a decreased gas density in the emitting layer in all cavities, supporting model expectations for C$_2$H$_2$ photodissociation. We discover a bifurcation in infrared index (lower in MR cavities) suggesting that the molecular dichotomy is linked to residual $\mu$m-size dust within millimeter disk cavities. Put together, these results suggest a feedback process between dust depletion, gas density decrease, and molecule dissociation. Disk cavities may have a common evolutionary sequence where MR switch into MP over time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An information-theoretic bound on cosmic coherence in finite-volume simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.02351]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We quantify the physical memory of the cosmic density field using mutual information between $N$-body snapshots at different redshifts, removing a random baseline to isolate gravitational correlations.

Recent progress in the investigation of flat cosmological models in Lovelock gravity unveiled the fact that in quadratic (Gauss–Bonnet) and cubic Lovelock gravities, the higher-order power-law solutions could play the role of both future and past asymptotes, and under some conditions, there could exist a smooth transition between them. So it is natural to question if this feature is unique to Gauss–Bonnet and cubic Lovelock gravities, or if it is a general feature of Lovelock gravity. Our analysis suggests that starting from quartic and in all higher-order Lovelock gravities, the high-order Kasner solution cannot play the role of a past asymptote, not only preventing the abovementioned transition from happening, but also potentially hindering the possibility of reaching viable compactification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01633" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hybrid PIC-fluid model for numerical simulation of laser-plasma interaction</a><span class="id">[2601.01633]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A hybrid PIC-fluid model is proposed for three dimensional numerical simulation of laser-plasma interaction.

In our scenario, both asymmetries are predominantly sourced by a dynamical $CP$ phase, namely the majoron. Its kinetic misalignment provides a sufficiently large, time-dependent effective $CP$ phase, allowing efficient asymmetry production even for low-scale right-handed neutrinos. In our framework, the sources of $CP$ violation responsible for the BAU and ADM are correlated with each other, leading to a predictive relation for the dark matter mass. In particular, when the dark matter asymmetry reaches its equilibrium value before freeze-out, the dark matter mass is typically predicted to lie in the range $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(100)~\mathrm{GeV}$, which lies within the sensitivity of direct detection experiments. On the other hand, if the dark matter asymmetry does not reach its equilibrium value due to weak coupling, the allowed mass range extends over a broader interval, $\mathcal{O}(0.1)~\mathrm{GeV} \lesssim m_{\chi} \lesssim \mathcal{O}(10)~\rm{TeV}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant Photon-Axion Mixing Driven by Dark Matter Oscillations</a><span class="id">[2601.02115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Wave propagation in a coherently oscillating background is intrinsically a periodically driven problem. We show that photon propagation through an axion dark matter background in the presence of a magnetic field is governed by Floquet physics, distinct from conventional static or adiabatic mixing paradigms. Coherent photon-axion mode conversion occurs when the mismatch between the photon and axion dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $\Delta_\gamma - \Delta_a \approx n m_a$ ($n \in \mathbb{Z}$) with the axion mass $m_a$, even far from the standard level-crossing condition $\Delta_\gamma \approx \Delta_a$. Crucially, this resonance disappears entirely if the axion oscillations are averaged over, and is therefore systematically missed in conventional static or adiabatic treatments. This driven resonance represents a unitary Floquet mode-mixing process and is fundamentally distinct from parametric instability or stimulated axion decay, preserving the axion dark matter number density. We develop a general Floquet framework for photon propagation in oscillating axion backgrounds, revealing that resonant mixing generates robust polarization effects during propagation. As an astrophysical application, we apply this mechanism to the realistic environment of the blazar 3C 279 to derive concrete constraints on the axion-photon coupling. While the observational manifestation depends on environmental conditions, the underlying driven mixing mechanism is generic to coherent axion dark matter, revealing a previously overlooked regime of photon-axion conversion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum dynamics of cosmological particle production: interacting quantum field theories with matrix product states</a><span class="id">[2601.02331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding real-time dynamics of interacting quantum fields in curved spacetime remains a major theoretical challenge. We employ tensor network methods to study such dynamics using interacting scalar and gauge theories in 1+1 spacetime dimensions, subject to a quench modeling a homogeneously expanding gravitational background. The models considered are the scalar $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and the Schwinger model, i.e. a Dirac fermion coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field which is equivalent via bosonization to a scalar field with a cosine self-interaction. In the free scalar limit, both theories reproduce known analytical results, providing a nontrivial numerical validation of bosonization in curved spacetime for the Schwinger model. Our central finding is that self-interactions lead to a suppression of gravitational particle production compared to the free-field case, as evidenced by two-point functions and the spectra of produced particles. We further examine the behavior of entanglement generation and find that interactions suppress entanglement growth in the $\lambda\phi^4$ theory, while in the Schwinger model, the interplay between suppressed particle production and enhanced inter-particle correlations leads to more complex entanglement behavior. Our results pave the way for further explorations of nonperturbative quantum real-time dynamics of interacting scalar and gauge theories in arbitrary gravitational backgrounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining $f_{NL}$ using the Large-Scale Modulation of Small-Scale Statistics</a><span class="id">[2305.03070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We implement a novel formalism to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type from the large-scale modulation of the small-scale power spectrum.

In this work, we continue analyzing NuSTAR observations of four more X-ray Binaries; two of which, namely Swift J174540.7–290015 and Swift J174540.2–290037 are X-ray Transients very close to the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy. The other two sources have complicated absorption, which is accounted for by time- and flux-resolved spectroscopy. The observation of MAXI J1631-479 is divided into two parts to account for the sudden increase in flux. The V404 Cygni spectra, obtained by combining two consecutive observations, are divided into 5 flux states and also account for absorption by quantifying the excess flux in the energy range of 6.5-7.0 keV. The constraints obtained are consistent with the Kerr hypothesis and are comparable with those obtained in previous studies and those from gravitational events. This work shows that even highly absorbed sources can be used for testing the Kerr hypothesis, which is possible with careful data reduction and subsequent data analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic-ray Acceleration in Core-Collapse Supernova Remnants with the Wind Termination Shock</a><span class="id">[2403.17335]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the attainable maximum energy of particles accelerated in the core-collapse supernova remnant (SNR) shock propagating in the free wind region with the Parker-spiral magnetic field, current sheet, and the wind termination shock (WTS) by using test particle simulations.

Test particle simulations show that particles escaped from the core-collapse SNR reach and move along the WTS, and eventually return to the SNR shock from the poles or equator of the WTS. The particle attainable energy can be boosted by this cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS and can be larger than the particle energy that is limited by escape from the SNR shock. The particle energy limited by the cyclic motion between the SNR shock and WTS is about $10-100~{\rm TeV}$.

However, even with such extreme parameters, the power spectrum of induced GWs is only about $0.3\%$ of that of vacuum GWs. This contribution remains insignificant when identifying the primary source of the detected CMB B-mode polarization. Furthermore, when our results are integrated with the constraints driven by P+ACT+LB+BK18, the contribution of induced GWs at CMB scales becomes negligible.

Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma Ray Bursts from Magnetic Reconnection in Cosmic Strings Wakes</a><span class="id">[2503.19345]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic reconnection in magnetized wakes of cosmic strings results in the release of a large amount of energy.

Thus, two energy scales naturally come into play: $\rho_*$ is the scale at which the nonlinearity of the EoS becomes relevant; $\rho_i$ is the energy scale around which the interaction starts to play an important role in the dynamics. Our focus is to understand whether there are parameter ranges for this system that can produce non-singular bouncing and emergent cosmologies for any initial condition. We complete a dynamical systems analysis, and find the parameter range such that trajectories always expand from a high energy non-singular de Sitter state. For flat and negative curvature models this de Sitter state is represented by a fixed point, the asymptotic past from which the universe emerges from. We find a subset of positive curvature models that during contraction get arbitrarily close to the de Sitter state, thus having a quasi-de Sitter bounce, then emerge from the bounce and expand, evolving toward spatial flatness. We find that the dimensionless parameter $q\equiv \rho_*/\rho_i$, which measures the relative strength of the nonlinear terms in the system, plays a crucial role in the topology of the phase space. When $q &lt; 3$, some trajectories expand toward a singularity, while others evolve toward a low energy cosmological constant at late-times, with a subset going through a decelerated matter dominate era before the final acceleration. When $q &gt; 3$, all trajectories are non-singular, and evolve toward a late-time cosmological constant. We find a subclass in this case in which all trajectories have at least one decelerated matter dominated phase, and accelerate at late-times.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fragmentation in Collapsar Disks: Migration, Growth, and Emission</a><span class="id">[2505.21617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a parameter survey of fragmentation in collapsar disks, using a revised version of the Chen &amp; Beloborodov (2007) model that determines the structure of steady state hyperaccretion disks in a general relativistic and neutrino cooled framework. We map out the range of disk conditions leading to gravitational instability alongside an exploration of the dimensionless cooling time $\beta$, which together determine whether fragmentation is likely to occur. We estimate the initial mass and density of fragments, finding that they occupy a unique region in the space of self-gravitating compact objects, with masses $M_{\rm f} \sim 10^{-3} M_\odot -10^{-1} M_\odot$ and densities $\rho_{\rm f}\sim 10^8-10^{11}~{\rm g~cm}^{-3}$. We then calculate their migration and mass growth (via Bondi-Hoyle accretion) as they inspiral through the collapsar disk. During a fragment's migration to the central black hole, it can grow its mass up to a range $M_{\rm f}\sim 10^{-1} M_\odot - 1 M_\odot$. In most cases, the final fragment mass is larger than the minimum cold stable neutron star mass but much smaller than any observed neutron star. The fragment briefly achieves peak accretion rates comparable to (or even larger than) that of the central engine. We propose that these bound fragments may give rise to observable astrophysical phenomena, and we approximately model two of these: (i) gamma ray burst variability produced by a secondary, fragment-launched jet; (ii) the generation of non-vacuum gravitational waveforms accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits to Extracting Neutron-Star Physics Constraints from NICER Pulse Profiles</a><span class="id">[2506.13879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modeling energy-dependent X-ray pulse profiles from rotation-powered millisecond pulsars observed with NICER has emerged as a promising avenue for measuring neutron star radii and probing the equation of state of cold, ultra-dense matter.

To explore the number of model parameters that can be inferred uniquely, we perform a quantitative assessment of the information content in X-ray pulse profiles by applying Fourier methods. We determine the number of independent observables that can be reliably extracted from the pulse shapes, as well as from complementary X-ray spectral data obtained with XMM-Newton, for key NICER targets.

While such a trend was anticipated by planetesimal-based planet formation models, it remains unclear what kind of atmospheric metallicity trends emerge from pebble-based planet formation. Moreover, while recent studies of solar system Jupiter suggest that uppermost observable atmosphere may not represent the bulk envelope composition, it remains uncertain how the envelope inhomogeneity influences the atmospheric metallicity trend. In this study, we develop disk evolution and planet formation models to investigate the possible atmospheric metallicity trends of giant exoplanets formed via pebble accretion and how they depend on the metallicity inhomogeneity within the envelope. We find that pebble-based planet formation produces two distinct mass-metallicity relations depending on planetary birthplace. Planets formed beyond the H2O snowline exhibit a mass-metallicity anti-correlation similar to that predicted by planetesimal-based models if their atmospheres are fully convective. This anti-correlation disappears if the convective mixing is inefficient. In contrast, planets formed inside the H2O snowline show a shallower mass-metallicity anti-correlation, regardless of the efficiency of atmospheric mixing. Many gas giants observed by JWST observations lie around the mass-metallicity relation predicted for formation at close-in orbits, although some planets with sub-stellar atmospheric metallicity appear to require unmixed envelopes and formation beyond the H2O snowline. We also examine the relationship between bulk and atmospheric metallicity and find a clear correlation that closely follows atmospheric metallicity that is comparable to bulk metallicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wide-field Polarization Imaging and Numerical Modeling of the Coma and Tail of Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)</a><span class="id">[2506.21284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Imaging polarimetry enables the spatially resolved investigation of cometary dust properties across different morphological structures.

The goal of this study is to examine the size, structure and composition of the dust particles in the coma and in particular in the tail of the bright comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and to infer possible differences. For this purpose, we rely on the method of telescopic wide-field polarimetric imaging of the comet in the visible to near-infrared domain in order to obtain the dependence of the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of the coma and tail on the phase angle across a broad range. An off-the-shelf industrial grade polarization camera was used in combination with a telescope of short aperture ratio. These observations are complemented by T-matrix and Discrete Dipole Approximation modeling using the MSTM5 and DDSCAT software framework, respectively, for simulation of light scattering by dust particles of fractal agglomerate and agglomerate debris morphology. Our observations indicate that the coma exhibits a high maximum DoLP of 0.34, which is further exceeded by a factor of about two by the DoLP of the comet's tail. Our modeling results suggest a 50:50 olivine-carbon composition. The fraction of agglomerate debris was found to be 50% in the coma and possibly higher in the tail. The differences between coma and tail in the observed maximum DoLP and the phase angle at which it occurs can be explained by a predominance of particles with radii larger than 0.6 micrometer in the coma vs. smaller sub-micrometer particles close to the Rayleigh limit in the tail [...]</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</a><span class="id">[2507.12965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe.

At the frequencies of interest, we study the familiar occurrence of the $1/f$ spectral signature. We also study point spectral features due to solar rotation and their relation with the $1/f$ signal. We report novel properties at timescales ranging from minutes up to years, using data selected by wind speed, phase of solar cycle, and cartesian components of the magnetic field. A surprising finding is that the power in solar rotation harmonics is consistent with an extension of the $1/f$ spectrum, down to frequencies as low as around $\unit[5 \times 10^{-7}]{Hz}$.

The most common method is to perform a systematic search of a database of observed orbits using an orbit dissimilarity criterion (D-criterion) and an algorithm. D-criteria compare the result of an orbit dissimilarity function (D-function) and a threshold. These D-functions associate one value to two meteoroids orbits. If this value is lower than the threshold, the meteoroids' orbits are considered similar. Group of meteors are thus formed. However, not all D-criteria have been evaluated, and their high number makes it hard to know which should be prioritised. This paper presents a review of each D-function, the tests they passed, the threshold choice, and the algorithms they are used with. We show what methods are currently used in the search for meteor showers, presenting statistics based on papers justifying the existence of established meteor showers. We review D-functions from eight different papers. We describe how thresholds and clustering algorithms are usually chosen. We also analyse tests that were performed on D-criteria. We discover that most of those criteria were not properly tested, and that some have been criticised for their theoretical background. Thus, we recommend performing a post-search analysis of the groups found, both in a statistical sense (to make sure the groups formed could not have been formed randomly) and an orbital dynamics sense (to check whether the group could indeed come from a singular parent body), to present the findings as potential meteor showers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Axion-Like Particle mediated Dark Matter with Observational Constraints: A Statistical and Machine Learning Approach</a><span class="id">[2509.18863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive study of axion-like particle (ALP) mediated dark matter (DM) effects on neutron star (NS) structure within a relativistic mean-field framework with non-linear mesonic interactions constrained by nuclear and astrophysical data.

We also develop a supervised interpolation model using \texttt{AutoGluon} to infer DM parameters from NS mass–radius curves, achieving \(R^2&gt;0.998\), and show that \(m_\chi\) is mainly constrained by global radius ratios, whereas \(q_f\) is driven by the tidal deformability \(\Lambda_{1.4}\).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as very massive star core-collapse events</a><span class="id">[2510.03402]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes (BHs), mergers of BHs and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. We explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive BHs via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins. We explore the formation rate of massive BH in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of BHs with mass greater than  30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these BHs are biased to low metallicity (Z&lt;0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the LFBOT AT 2018cow) can only be produce in these events under maximal disc mass and angular momentum conditions. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for at least some LFBOTs, but faces challenges. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in the failed supernova interpretation overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04953" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation.

With respect to our first paper, we develop a full tomographic analysis based on realistic photometric redshifts that allows us to derive Fisher forecasts in the ($\sigma_8$, $w_0$) plane for a Euclid-like data release 1 (DR1) setup. We find that the five higher-order statistics (HOS) that satisfy the Gaussian likelihood assumption of the Fisher formalism (one-point probability distribution function, $\ell$1-norm, peak counts, Minkowski functionals, and Betti numbers) each outperform the shear two-point correlation functions by a factor of $2.5$ on the $w_0$ forecasts, with only marginal improvement when used in combination with two-point estimators, suggesting that every HOS is able to retrieve both the non-Gaussian and Gaussian information of the matter density field. The similar performance of the different estimators is explained by a homogeneous use of multi-scale and tomographic information, optimized to lower computational costs. These results hold for the three mass mapping techniques of the Euclid pipeline, aperture mass, Kaiser–Squires, and Kaiser–Squires plus, and they are unaffected by the application of realistic star masks. Finally, we explored the use of HOS with the Bernardeau–Nishimichi–Taruya (BNT) nulling scheme approach, finding promising results toward applying physical scale cuts to HOS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Sign of a Magnetar Remnant Following the Kilonova-Producing Long GRB 211211A $\sim 1.7~$Years Later</a><span class="id">[2510.09744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In addition to a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB), the merger of two neutron stars may produce a temporarily or indefinitely stable neutron star remnant with a strong magnetic field (a &quot;magnetar&quot;). As this magnetar remnant spins down, it can deposit its rotational energy into the surrounding kilonova ejecta, producing synchrotron emission that peaks in the radio bands $\sim$months-years after the merger (&quot;boosted kilonova&quot;). The nearby ($z=0.0763$) long-duration GRB 211211A, which has an apparent kilonova counterpart and likely neutron star merger progenitor, may have produced such a remnant. We observed the location of GRB 211211A at 6 GHz with the NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) spanning $\approx 0.54$-$1.7~$years after the burst. We do not detect any radio emission, placing strong limits on the energy deposited into the ejecta by any remnant to $\lesssim 4.4 \times 10^{52}~{\rm erg}$. Due to the proximity of the event, we are also able to place limits on a kilonova afterglow that did not receive any additional energy deposition, though it is possible such emission will be suppressed until $\sim 4~{\rm years}$ after the burst, when the kilonova is expected to overtake the forward shock of the GRB. Future observations with the VLA and next-generation radio facilities will be able to further constrain the magnetar-boosted kilonova and kilonova afterglow scenarios, as well as directly constrain models in the scenario that GRB 211211A was instead produced by a collapsar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits on forming coreless terrestrial worlds in the TRAPPIST-1 system</a><span class="id">[2511.01231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With seven temperate Earth-sized planets revolving around an ultracool red dwarf, the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to verify models of exoplanet composition, differentiation, and interior structure. In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the spectral characteristics of the periodic burster 4U 1323-62: Type-I X-ray burst and persistent emission</a><span class="id">[2511.03172]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U 1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.42 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational wave standard sirens from GWTC-3 combined with DESI DR2 and DESY5: A late-universe probe of the Hubble constant and dark energy</a><span class="id">[2511.12017]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the combination of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data and the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements has shown a $\sim$3$\sigma$ preference for a dynamical dark energy model with a phantom-crossing behavior. However, such a phantom-crossing dark energy evolution further exacerbates the already severe Hubble tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Moreover, there exists a $\sim2\sigma$ tension between the DESI DR2 BAO and CMB datasets. Therefore, it is essential to measure the Hubble constant and dark-energy equation-of-state (EoS) parameters using only late-universe observations. In this work, we investigate a novel late-universe data combination: gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens, BAO, and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). This combination provides a fully distance-ladder- and CMB-independent determination of the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS. Using 47 GW standard sirens from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, the DESI DR2 BAO data, and DESY5 SNe Ia data, in the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we obtain $H_0=74.8^{+6.3}_{-8.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.320^{+0.015}_{-0.012}$, $w_0=-0.775^{+0.072}_{-0.074}$, and $w_a=-0.80\pm0.47$, indicating a mild phantom-crossing behavior within the $1\sigma$ credible interval with an $H_0$ value consistent with the distance ladder measurements. Our analysis demonstrates the power of GW standard sirens in breaking parameter degeneracies, and this novel data combination provides joint constraints on the Hubble constant and the dark-energy EoS parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isocurvature-induced features in multi-field Higgs-$R^2$ inflation</a><span class="id">[2512.14455]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study primordial perturbations in Higgs–$R^2$ inflation in the presence of non-minimal kinetic mixing between the Higgs field and the scalaron.

For $\xi_h \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$, transient turning of the inflationary trajectory leads to a transfer between adiabatic and isocurvature modes, generating localized features in the primordial curvature power spectrum. In contrast, in the weak-coupling regime $\xi_h \ll 1$, the curvature spectrum remains nearly featureless while isocurvature perturbations do not fully decay, resulting in a residual isocurvature component at the end of inflation.

A multi-wavelength characterisation by Juno reveals the spatial distribution, vertical structure, and energetics of the FFRs. The cloud tops display multiple lobes of stratiform aerosols, separated by darker, cloud-free lanes, and embedded with smaller eddies and high-altitude cumulus clouds. These cyclonic FFRs are microwave-bright in shallow-sounding wavelengths ($p&lt;5$ bars) and microwave-dark in deep-sounding wavelengths ($p&gt;10$ bars), with the transition potentially associated with the water condensation layer (6-7 bars). Associating microwave contrasts with temperature anomalies, this implies despinning of cyclonic eddies above/below their mid-planes. Despite deep roots (being detectable in wavelengths sounding $\sim100$ bars), they are “pancake vortices” with horizontal extents at least an order of magnitude larger than their depth. In the northern hemisphere, FFRs are most common in cyclonic belts poleward of $40^\circ$N (all latitudes are planetocentric), particularly a North Polar Filamentary Belt (NPFB) near $66-70^\circ$N that defines the transition from organised belts/zones to the chaotic polar domain. This distribution explains the high lightning rates from $45-80^\circ$N, peaking in a belt poleward of $52.3^\circ$N, which may trace the availability of water for moist convection. Many observed lightning flashes can be associated to specific FFRs containing bright storms, but some FFRs display no activity, suggesting quiescent periods during storm evolution. Analogies to Earth's oceanic eddies suggest that cyclones deform isentropic surfaces at their midplanes, raising deep water-rich layers upwards to promote moist convection, release latent heat, and inject clouds into the upper troposphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20185" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep learning-driven atmospheric parameter prediction for hot subdwarf stars with synthetic and observed spectra</a><span class="id">[2512.20185]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms to predict atmospheric parameters of hot subdwarfs.

To ensure the reliability of these tests, it is essential to identify and address potential sources of error, particularly those arising from missing physics in the waveform models used in GW data analysis. This paper investigates potential biases in these tests arising from strong gravitational lensing, an effect not currently incorporated into the standard framework for GR tests. In the geometric optics approximation, strong lensing produces three types of images: Type I, Type II, and Type III. While Type I and Type III images do not distort the signal, Type II images introduce a characteristic phase shift that can mimic GR deviations for signals with higher-order modes, precession, or eccentricity. We assess the response of four standard GR tests on simulated Type II lensed BBH signals, including the two parameterized tests (TIGER and FTI), the modified dispersion relation test and the inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test. We focus on precessing waveforms for binaries with total masses of $20M_{\odot}$ and $80M_{\odot}$, and dimensionless spins of 0.5 and 0.95, considering a fixed signal-to-noise ratio of 25 using the design A+ sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo network. Our findings indicate that more mass-asymmetric and higher-spin binaries show larger false deviations from GR in the TIGER and modified dispersion relation tests when applying GR tests to Type II lensed signals. These results highlight the risk of false GR violations as detector sensitivity improves in future observational runs. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the possibility of strong lensing before drawing conclusions about deviations from GR in GW signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axion-like Dark Matter Search with Space-based Gravitational Wave Detectors</a><span class="id">[2504.10083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel modification to the optical benches of space-based gravitational wave detectors (SGWDs) to enable the detection of axion-like dark matter (ALDM)-induced birefringence without altering the polarization of inter-spacecraft laser links.

Periodic boundaries reduce wall artifacts yet cannot realize finite net vorticity because of topological obstruction, so bulk simulations with non-zero circulation are typically unavailable. Hence, we impose quasi-periodic boundary conditions that keep the superfluid's density periodic while enforcing phase windings consistent with a net prescribed total vorticity. This setting conserves the net number of vortices and enables long-time tracking of vortex trajectories in settings that finite containers cannot capture. This allows us to study vortex depinning and nucleation leading to the creation of Kármán vortex streets and perfectly periodic vortex arrays. The framework also provides a toy model for studying vortex dynamics in the bulk of neutron stars, free of possible limitations induced by confining potentials.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multifield Cosmology and the Dark Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.17179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multifield models, arising from multiple scalars interacting with gravity, provide a rich theoretical framework for addressing fundamental problems in modern cosmology.

The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature.

Currently, the values of the three masses only have upper limits from cosmology and experiments like KATRIN. This paper shows that the SN 1987A neutrino data can remarkably yield values for the three neutrino masses, and not merely upper limits. Although this seemingly preposterous idea was suggested a dozen years ago by the author, here it is demonstrated in a much more convincing manner with many new elements, including a stronger statistical treatment, and a thorough explanation of why the method used to find the three masses from supernova SN 1987A neutrino data really works. The key to finding the three neutrino masses is realizing why three normally accepted assumptions are unjustified, The three rejected assumptions are:(a) the 5-hr early LSD (Mont Blanc) neutrinos are unrelated to SN 1987A, (b) any neutrino masses $m_k&gt;1 eV/c^2$ cannot be reconciled with upper limits on the “effective mass&quot; from KATRIN and other data, and (c) the spread in neutrino emission times from SN 1987A data is too great for the method to work. A particularly crucial piece of evidence supporting the claim made in the paper's title involves a recent negative KATRIN result finding an absence of sterile neutrinos. This absence of a sterile neutrino signal leads to two tests of the claim based on existing data: one for KATRIN and one for IceCube.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A mini-review on combinatorial solutions to the Marcus-Lushnikov irreversible aggregation</a><span class="id">[2512.11459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decade, a combinatorial framework for discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has emerged.

Using the constant kernel as an example, we derive combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and their standard deviation, and present the complete probability distribution for cluster counts. The method is then extended to several kernels (additive, product, linear-chain, condensation) by explicitly enumerating ways to form clusters of a given size. For general kernels, approximate solutions are obtained via recursive expressions, enabling predictions without explicit solutions. Applications to aerosol growth and planetesimal formation are demonstrated, with comparisons to numerical results. We summarize issues of validity and precision and propose open problems.
