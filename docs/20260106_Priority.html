The LMC:Milky Way (MW) interaction is also $\sim$1:10, and is expected to perturb the MW's DM distribution. However, no framework exists to quantify the severity of these perturbations over multiple pericenters and longer periods of time, such as the LMC-SMC interaction history. We construct basis function expansions of a high-resolution N-body simulation of the Clouds interacting in isolation and analyze their DM distributions at an epoch approximating the time of infall to the MW. Our goal is to quantify how the Clouds distort each other's DM distributions without the MW. The LMC halo's response to the SMC includes a $\sim 20$ kpc-long dynamical friction wake and the displacement of the LMC's density center during each SMC pericenter, which produces two overdensities in the LMC halo (at $\sim$60 and $\sim$100 kpc) at MW infall. The SMC's tidal radius at infall is just $\sim4$ kpc, at which point the SMC has lost two-thirds of its initial DM mass to the LMC. The distortions to the Clouds' halos produce a highly asymmetric acceleration field. Accurate orbit integration in the LMC-SMC system must account for the time-dependent shapes of both halos. The SMC-induced perturbations in the LMC DM halo resemble the MW-LMC system, and persist over multiple SMC pericenters. We conclude that 1:10 satellite:host encounters induce characteristic deformations in both DM halos across all host mass scales, with implications for merger rates and tests of DM models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflight performance and future improvements for the INtegral Field Ultraviolet Spectrographic Experiment, the first far ultraviolet integral field spectrograph</a><span class="id">[2601.00956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Integral field spectroscopy allows for spectral mapping of extended sources in a time efficient manner. An integral field unit (IFU) in the ultraviolet on Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) could be used to quickly map extended objects like supernova remnants or galaxies and their surroundings, but there are technical challenges to an ultraviolet IFU. The INtegral Field Ultraviolet Spectrographic Experiment (INFUSE), a sounding rocket project, is the first static configuration far ultraviolet integral field spectrograph. INFUSE features an f/16, 0.49m Cassegrain telescope and a 26-element image slicer feeding 26 replica holographic gratings, with spectra imaged by the largest cross-strip microchannel plate detector flown in space. The first launch of INFUSE occurred from White Sands Missile Range on October 29th, 2023, and demonstrated spectral multiplexing, successfully detecting ionizing gas emission in the XA region of the Cygnus Loop. INFUSE will launch again in fall 2025 to observe NGC 2366, a local analog for Green Pea type galaxies, with several enhancements including a xenon-enhanced lithium fluoride + aluminum coated grating, testing the leading flight coating for HWO for the first time. The INFUSE IFU is designed as a pathfinder for a potential IFU mode on HWO, enabling rapid 3D spectroscopy of extended sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Widespread Extended [CII] Emission in High-Redshift Galaxies: Insights from the FIRE-2 Cosmological Zoom-in Simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.00959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent ALMA observations reveal diffuse [CII] emission (“[CII] halos&quot;) extending to $\sim 10\,$kpc in galaxies at $4 &lt; z &lt; 6$. These measurements provide new insights into high-redshift galactic ecosystems and processes that drive metal enrichment on circumgalactic scales. To better understand the nature of [CII] halos, we analyze a suite of high-redshift FIRE-2 simulations at $5 \leq z \leq 6$ in the stellar mass range of $10^{9}$–$10^{10.5}\,M_{\odot}$. By post-processing these simulations with three-dimensional dust radiative transfer and photoionization modeling, we generate synthetic images of [CII] and UV continuum emission, from which we extract one-dimensional surface brightness profiles. Our results reproduce both the galaxy-integrated and spatial distribution of [CII] and UV emission, capturing in particular the more extended profile of [CII] emission. Comparing the time evolution of [CII] halos with bursty star formation histories of the simulated galaxies, we find that [CII] emission becomes more spatially extended following the decline of star formation rate in recent starburst episodes. This implies a strong correlation between extended [CII] emission and bursty star formation, consistent with a key role for star formation-driven outflows in producing [CII] halos – though the kinematics of [CII]-emitting gas suggest that inflows and turbulent motions are also significant contributors. We also find a modest contribution from satellite galaxies to extended [CII] emission. Our framework can be readily applied to predict the observability of [CII] halos at higher redshifts and extended to create spatially resolved synthetic observations of other important emission lines, such as [OIII] and H$\alpha$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GA-NIFS: AGN activity in a Lyα emitter within a triple-AGN system anchored by a passive galaxy at z=3</a><span class="id">[2601.00960]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive quenched galaxies at z&gt;3 challenge models of early galaxy evolution, as their rapid formation and abrupt quenching require efficient feedback, often linked to active galactic nuclei (AGN). The quiescent galaxy GS10578 at z=3.1 is a key example of this population. Previous JWST/NIRSpec IFU data revealed an AGN outflow and uncovered a compact pair of AGN separated by  5 kpc. In addition, VLT/MUSE spectroscopy has identified a third AGN candidate at a projected distance of  30 kpc, associated with a luminous Lya emitter (LAE2) characterised by high-ionisation UV lines, although rest-frame optical diagnostics were not previously available. We aim to confirm the nature of LAE2 using rest-frame optical diagnostics enabled by new JWST data, and to characterise the physical and ionisation properties of both LAE2 and a distinct nearby Lya emitter (LAE1) that lacks any detectable continuum counterpart. We analyse new NIRSpec IFU observations targeting the optical nebular lines of LAE1 and LAE2, complemented with MUSE data, as part of the GA-NIFS project. We extract integrated and spatially resolved spectra, construct emission-line maps, and use standard diagnostic diagrams to determine ionisation sources and kinematics. LAE2 exhibits line ratios fully consistent with an embedded AGN. Its optical lines display a clumpy morphology and irregular kinematics on sub-kpc scales. Except for Lya, LAE1 remains undetected in all nebular lines and in JWST imaging. The similarity of the LAE1 and LAE2 Lya profiles in both velocity and flux suggests that LAE1 traces resonantly scattered emission rather than in-situ star formation. Our analysis reveals that the environment of GS10578 contains both multi-black-hole activity and gas structures on tens-of-kpc scales, offering new insights into how feedback and satellite interactions influence the late evolutionary stages of quenched massive galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The internal kinematics of local young stellar associations. Identifying correlations among age, expansion, rotation, and shear</a><span class="id">[2601.01006]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The local (&lt;200 pc away) young (&lt;50 Myr old) stellar associations (LYSA) provide fundamental evidence for the study of the star formation process in the local neighbourhood. Aims. We aim at exploring robust statistical correlations in the internal kinematics of LYSAs and of these with age. Methods. We analyse a public data set containing the linear velocity field parameters and expansion ages of 18 LYSAs. We identify the most robust correlations using frequentist and Bayesian methods. Results. Among the 45 correlations, we identify only four that passed both frequentist and Bayesian criteria, with these four related to radial motions in the Galactic Z direction. We hypothesise several origins for these four correlations and identify the gravitational potential of the Galactic disk as the most likely driving element. It imprinted the observed motions in the parent molecular clouds, and once the stars were formed, it also damped these motions on a timescale shorter than the LYSAs' ages. Conclusions. The internal kinematics of local young stellar associations contain fundamental information about the star-formation process that is not fully addressed by star-formation theories, in particular, rotation and shear. Although the Galactic potential appears to be the driving force of these correlations, we urge the theoretical community to provide predictions about the internal motions of expansion, rotation, and shear of stellar associations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the formation mechanisms of tidal structures in globular clusters of extragalactic origin</a><span class="id">[2601.01110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal structures around globular clusters provide valuable insights into cluster evolution and the hierarchical assembly of the Milky Way. Using wide-field imaging data from the DESI Legacy Survey combined with a color-magnitude matched-filter technique, we perform a systematic analysis of extra-tidal features in 28 Galactic globular clusters of likely extragalactic origin, representing the largest homogeneous sample examined in this context to date. The clusters display diverse morphologies: 12 exhibit tidal tails, 9 show diffuse envelopes, and 7 reveal no clear extra-tidal features. Notably, we report the first detection of an extended tidal structure around the Sagittarius-associated cluster Terzan 7. To explore the underlying drivers, we compare intrinsic properties, orbital dynamics, and possible accretion associations across morphological groups. From the parameter distributions, complemented by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that total mass, escape velocity, concentration, tidal filling factor, pericentric radius, eccentricity and radial angle in action-angle coordinates are all likely group-sensitive parameters. These results suggest that both internal cluster properties and orbital configurations play important roles in shaping extra-tidal morphologies. In addition, the cluster's accretion history shows no clear correlation with the presence of tidal features, indicating that it is not a direct driver of outer structure formation. Overall, the diversity of tidal structures is unlikely to be governed by a single factor, but instead reflects the interplay between internal dynamical evolution and the external Galactic environment. This study provides the most comprehensive constraints so far on the physical processes driving extra-tidal structures in accreted globular clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical enrichment in the Ophiuchus cluster core studied by high-resolution XRISM spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2601.01114]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters provide an ideal laboratory for investigating the chemical enrichment history of the universe because they host the hot intracluster medium (ICM), which contains various chemical elements. The X-ray observations have constituted a unique way to measure the element abundance and composition of the ICM due to their prominent emission lines in the 0.1-10 keV range. We explore the metal abundances and chemical enrichment in the cool-core galaxy cluster, Ophiuchus, by using a 217 ks XRISM data set. The abundances of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni are accurately determined using high-resolution spectroscopy. We find that the average uncertainties of chemical composition, which are reported as X/Fe ratios, are only 10-20%. The X/Fe abundance pattern of the Ophiuchus centre is remarkably consistent with solar, which is reminiscent of the Hitomi constraint on the Perseus core. The observed abundance pattern can be replicated globally by linear combination models of core-collapse, including massive progenitors, and Type Ia supernovae. While nucleosynthesis models typically underestimate the Ca/Fe ratio, a substantial contribution of Ca-rich gap transients may help improve the deficit of Ca. High-resolution spectroscopic data can enable us to estimate the underlying impact on the chemical enrichment from subclasses of Type Ia supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluctuation dynamos in supersonic turbulence at ${\rm Pm} \gtrsim 1$</a><span class="id">[2601.01138]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fluctuation dynamos provide a robust mechanism for amplifying weak seed magnetic fields in turbulent astrophysical plasmas. However, their behaviour in the highly compressible regimes characteristic of the interstellar medium (ISM) remains incompletely understood. Using high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of supersonic turbulence with rms Mach number $\mathcal{M}_{\rm rms} \approx 11$, we explore fluctuation dynamos across magnetic Prandtl numbers ${\rm Pm} = 1-10$. At ${\rm Pm} = 1$, dynamo growth is slower and saturates at lower magnetic-to-kinetic energy ratios, with amplification in the kinematic phase dominated by compression rather than line stretching. In contrast, at ${\rm Pm} = 10$, vortical stretching emerges as the dominant mechanism, yielding faster growth, higher saturation levels, and stronger suppression of density-magnetic field correlations by magnetic pressure. This transition is reflected in the correlation coefficient between density and magnetic field strength, which is strongly positive at ${\rm Pm} = 1$ but decreases significantly at higher ${\rm Pm}$. Across all runs, the ratio of velocity-to-magnetic integral scales is $\sim 3.4$, independent of ${\rm Pm}$, while the ratio of viscous to resistive dissipation scales increase with the increase in ${\rm Pm}$. Synthetic Faraday rotation measures (RM) reveal coherence lengths of $\sim (1/4-1/3)$ of the forcing scale across the range of ${\rm Pm}$ explored. Using these coherence scales, we discuss the potential contribution of fluctuation dynamos to Faraday rotation expected from turbulent, gas rich young disk galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-delay and lens galaxy redshift in the doubly imaged quasar PS J2305+3714</a><span class="id">[2601.01230]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from a seven-season (2018-2024) monitoring campaign of the gravitationally lensed quasar system PS J2305+3714 using the 1.5-m Maidanak Telescope in the optical R-band. From these data, the amplitude of possible microlensing variability does not exceed 10 mmag on a 7-yr timescale. Additionally, we measure a time delay of $t_{AB}$ = 52.2$\pm$2.5 days, with the brighter image A leading. Long-slit \WHT spectroscopy refines the quasar redshift to $z_s$ = 1.791 and provides the first measurement of the lens redshift, $z_d$ = 0.473. The flux ratios of the quasar images in the MgII $\lambda$2800 emission line and in the adjacent continuum are nearly identical, indicating minimal microlensing effects in the spectral domain, which is consistent with the very weak microlensing signal in the time domain. Using precise astrometry from recent HST imaging and the MgII flux ratio, we also built two simple mass models for the lens system. The close agreement between the measured delay and those predicted by the mass models, measured redshifts, and a concordance $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, confirms the robustness of our results and highlights PS J2305+3714 as a promising system for future time-delay cosmography.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024abvb: A Type Icn Supernova in the Outskirts of its Host Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2601.01333]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024abvb, which exhibits early-time prominent photoionized narrow emission lines of C II superposed on a blue continuum. The absence of Balmer features indicates that the SN exploded within hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Together with the lack of explicit evidence of helium signatures, we tentatively identify SN 2024abvb as a Type Icn SN (SN Icn). After correcting for extinction, we estimate an r-band peak absolute magnitude of -19.7, placing SN 2024abvb in the luminous regime of SNe Icn. We adopted a hybrid model that accounts for both the energy released by the ejecta-CSM interaction and the radioactive decay of nickel synthesized in the SN ejecta to fit the light curve of SN 2024abvb. The best-fit model to the multiband light curves within the first   40 days after explosion suggests that the CSM, radioactive nickel, and ejecta masses to be 0.28 Msun, 3.54 * 10-3 Msun, and 0.12 Msun, respectively. Such a low ejecta mass indicates that the progenitor star of SN 2024abvb experienced a significant mass-stripping process, consistent with the hydrogen-poor and helium-poor spectral features. SN 2024abvb provides important insights into the physical origins of the rare subclass of SNe Icn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulence driving in a star-forming Milky-Way-type galaxy</a><span class="id">[2601.01427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The life-cycle, structure, and dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is regulated by turbulence. Complex physical processes, including supernova (SN) explosions, shear, and gravitational collapse, drive and maintain turbulence, but it is still an open question what turbulence driving mode is primarily excited by these different mechanisms. The turbulence driving parameter, b, can be used to quantify the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence. Compressive driving is characterised by b   1, while purely solenoidal driving gives b   0.3. To quantify the turbulence in the galactic ISM, we investigate the time evolution of b, as well as the turbulent Mach number, and plasma beta (thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio), and its correlation with star formation in the magnetised warm neutral medium (WNM) of the TIGRESS shearing-box simulations of a kpc-sized patch of a Milky-Way-like galaxy, over a 100 Myr time period (  half an orbital time). In this simulation the turbulence is driven by a combination of shear, gravitational collapse, and star formation feedback in the form of radiation and SNe. We find that the turbulence driving parameter fluctuates in time between b   0.4 and b   1. We find a time-dependent correlation of b with star formation activity, such that high star formation rates follow about one turbulent turnover time (  10 Myr) after phases of highly compressive driving (b &gt; 0.5). About 20 Myr after the peak in star formation, type-B SN feedback drives up the WNM fraction and turbulent Mach numbers, and reduces plasma beta and the driving to b   0.4-0.5.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A statistical framework for quantitative spectroscopy of luminous blue stars</a><span class="id">[2601.01491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: Quantitative spectroscopy of luminous blue stars relies on detailed non-LTE model atmospheres whose increasing physical realism makes direct, iterative analyses computationally demanding. Aims: We introduce MAUI (Machine-learning Assisted Uncertainty Inference), a statistical framework designed for efficient Bayesian inference of stellar parameters using emulator-based spectral models. Methods: MAUI employs Gaussian-process-based emulators trained on a limited set of non-LTE simulations, combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore posterior distributions. We validate the approach with recovery experiments and demonstrate it on Galactic late-type O dwarf and early-type B dwarf/subgiant stars. Results: The emulator reproduces the predictions of full atmosphere models within quoted uncertainties while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. Posterior distributions are well calibrated, with conservative coverage across all stellar parameters. Conclusions: Emulator-driven Bayesian inference retains the accuracy of classical analyses at a fraction of the computational expense, enabling posterior sampling that would be prohibitive with direct model evaluations. This positions emulators as a practical tool for high-fidelity spectroscopy of massive stars as atmosphere models grow more demanding.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spheroidal core-mantle particle absorption, scattering, and polarisation in the long-wavelength limit</a><span class="id">[2601.01515]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The numerical calculation of optical properties (extinction, absorption, scattering and polarisation efficiencies) is often time-consuming for non-spherical and inhomogeneous particles.

Using the \texttt{PeTar} code, we perform direct $N$-body simulations of an open cluster initially containing $10^4$ stars, evolving within a gaseous medium spanning a range of ambient densities. Our results demonstrate that NDF associated with stellar outflows interacting with the surrounding gas can enhance the rate of cluster expansion, preferentially transporting stars toward the cluster outskirts. This behavior is accompanied by a more rapid decline in the number of binaries composed of a neutron star and a main-sequence star. A statistical analysis of binary orbital parameters further indicates that, compared to DF-dominated evolution, NDF tends to retain systems with larger semi-major axes and lower eccentricities. Outflow-ambient gas interactions can modify the dynamical processing of binaries in star clusters, leading to changes in the survival fraction and composition of the remaining binary population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerated evolution of galaxy host halo masses during Cosmic Dawn from deep JWST clustering</a><span class="id">[2601.01697]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the deepest clustering analysis of early galaxies to date, analyzing $N_{\rm{g}} \simeq 6500$ photometrically-selected Lyman Break Galaxies from JWST's Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) to reveal how galaxies and dark matter evolved during cosmic dawn ($5 \leq z &lt; 11$). Using halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling of the two-point angular correlation function, we trace the galaxy-halo relationships across the first billion years of cosmic history. Our analysis reveals that galaxies at $z = 10.6$ reside in dark matter halos over an order of magnitude less massive ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{10.12} M_{\odot}$) than their counterparts at $z = 5.5$ ($M_{\rm{h}} \sim 10^{11.45} M_{\odot}$), while exhibiting correspondingly higher effective bias values ($b_{\rm{g}}^{\rm{eff}} = 8.13^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ compared to $5.64^{+0.10}_{-0.13}$). Correspondingly, the satellite galaxy fraction hints at a declining trend with decreasing redshift, reaching $&lt;1\%$ by $z \sim 5-6$. However, the significant systematic and random uncertainties in the data-model comparison prevent us from drawing robust conclusions on the evolution - if any - of the satellite fraction during the epoch of reionization.

The deep medium-resolution spectrum enables the measurement of its stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_\star = 95_{-33}^{+38}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$), the smallest value recorded among spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$. Coupled with a compact size ($0.41\pm0.03\, {\rm kpc}$), it yields a dynamical mass estimate of $\log(M_{\rm dyn}/M_\odot)=9.75_{-0.38}^{+0.29}$. Its star formation history suggests that half of the stellar mass was in place $\sim1\,{\rm Gyr}$ before the observed epoch, with quenching occurring $\sim0.2\,{\rm Gyr}$ prior to $z=2.08$. These results confirm that AURORA-LQG1 is genuinely quenched, rather than in a temporary phase of suppressed star formation rate. AURORA-LQG1 is consistent with the mass fundamental plane at $z\sim2$, previously constrained only by massive quiescent systems. Compared with more massive counterparts at the same epoch observed with NIRSpec grating spectroscopy, the time since quenching for AURORA-LQG1 is among the shortest observed. The galaxy resides in a possible dense group-scale ($\sim50$ kpc) environment containing one companion with tentative spectroscopic redshift and five companion candidates, and it is embedded in a known protocluster on Mpc scales. A potential environmental influence on its evolution could explain the outside-in quenching suggested by the positive gradient of size with wavelength. This study demonstrates that deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy enables low-mass quiescent galaxies at Cosmic Noon to be characterized with a level of detail long reserved for massive systems, offering valuable new insights into how quenching operates in these underexplored low-mass systems.

The non-LTE analysis yielded kinetic temperatures ($T_{kin}$) ranging from 33.7 K to 265 K and H2 densities (n(H$_2$)) between 0.8 X $10^4$ to 1.05 X $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$, providing a detailed characterization of the dense molecular gas contained in these clumps. In addition to the para-H$_2$CO emission arising from the targeted clump a large fraction (57%) of the sources exhibit multiple para-H$_2$CO components, with the secondary components being characterized by higher $T_{kin}$ and broader linewidths. Investigating the nature of the secondary component revealed its association with supersonic non-thermal motions and turbulent gas. When comparing the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust components with those of the ionizing gas, we find that parameters directly linked to the central high-mass star such as bolometric luminosity and Lyman continuum photon rate, show stronger and more systematic correlations.

In anticipation of upcoming space-based very long baseline Interferometry (SVLBI) missions, megamaser disk AGN offer a uniquely valuable probe of strong-gravity regimes through black hole shadow (BHS) imaging beyond Sgr A* and M87*. In this work, we (1) map the predicted BHS diameters of twenty-one of the most precisely characterized megamaser disk AGN to submillimeter-millimeter (submm-mm) interferometric baseline requirements, (2) estimate their respective AGN-core flux densities at submm-mm wavelengths, accounting for thermal-dust contamination, extended-jet emission, and intrinsic variability, and (3) determine the astrometric precision required to detect spin-dependent positional offsets between the BHS and the megamaser disk dynamical center. NGC 4258 stands out as the only megamaser disk AGN detectable on Earth-L2 baselines in the submm-mm regime, while other megamaser disk AGN in the sample would require baselines approaching Earth-L4/L5 distances; moreover, only a handful exhibit flux densities above $\sim$10 mJy. Our results further indicate a submillimeter excess in NGC 4258, suggesting that the accretion disk remains thin down to a transitional radius of $\lesssim 100$ Schwarzschild radii, within which the flow becomes advection dominated. For a maximally spinning supermassive black hole in NGC 4258, we show that the astrometric precision of the BHS centroid necessary to detect the BHS-dynamical center offset could, in principle, be achieved with Earth-Moon baselines; however, it would also demand astrometric precision of the water maser dynamical center roughly fifty times better than what is currently attainable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extended Ionized Fe Objects in the UWIFE Survey</a><span class="id">[2601.01812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore systematically the shocked gas in the first Galactic quadrant of the Milky Way using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE).

For the dynamical modelling, we used the updated parallel N-body code phi-GPU, including stellar evolution. We prepared three sets of GC models with different half-mass radii (r_hm), each consisting of 50 full N-body GC models, and integrated these models in an external, time-variable MW-like potential taken from the cosmological database IllustrisTNG-100. The simulations cover the time interval from -10 Gyr to -5 Gyr, enabling us to assess the rate of early stellar accretion onto the proto-NSC. We find that GC models with average orbital eccentricities of 0.4-0.5 and orbits oriented perpendicular to the galactic disc contribute most significantly to the mass of the proto-NSC formation. Accretion is especially efficient in the first billion years and in compact GC models with r_hm = 1 pc. In all sets, the dominant accreted stellar population consists of low-mass stars ( 0.33 Msun). However, the accreted mass alone is insufficient to fully account for the current NSC mass. Based on our extended set of numerical simulations, we obtained an average lower limit of mass contribution ( 6 percent) to the NSC from investigated GCs. The fraction of mass contribution from individual disrupted GCs can significantly vary from 0.1 percent up to 90 percent. Generally, we conclude that the GC stellar accretion channel alone might not be sufficient to ensure the present-day MW galaxy NSC mass budget.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling Fiber Networks and Core Formation in the DR21 South Filament</a><span class="id">[2601.01974]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution ($\sim$1000 AU) 3 mm observations with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array toward the DR21 South Filament, aiming to reveal its internal fragmentation and search for deeply embedded star-forming activities.

The 3 mm continuum, CS (2$-$1), and HCO$^+$ (1$-$0) emissions reveal continuous and diffuse structures with measured FWHM widths of 0.054, 0.029, and 0.030 pc, respectively. In contrast, the H$^{13}$CO$^+$ (1$-$0) emission appears more clumpy and localized. The non-thermal motion in the filament is predominantly subsonic to transonic. We detect 13 dense cores in NH$_2$D (1$_{11}-1_{01}$), three of which coincide with continuum peaks; virial analysis suggests most are gravitationally bound. Using a friend-of-friend algorithm, we identify 32, 34, and 22 velocity-coherent fibers from the CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ data, respectively. Compared to fibers traced by CS and HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ fibers are more frequently associated with NH$_2$D cold cores and exhibit higher average mass-per-unit-length values. Differences among CS, HCO$^+$, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ emissions likely arise from variations in effective critical densities.

The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) has been used to conduct a medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of 697 helium-rich hot subdwarfs and related stars. Using 587 stars from the full SALT sample, we define an unsupervised data-led classification system based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Clustering (SC), designed as a data-discovery tool to identify possible new groups and sequences within the data. Using the first 3 principal components (PCs), we identify 6 major clusters of hot subdwarf spectra, identified with the traditional spectral classes of classical sdB and sdO stars, helium-rich He-sdO stars and very hot subdwarfs. Two clusters covering large volumes of PC space include a) He-sdB and He-sdOB stars and b) intermediate iHe-sdB and iHe-sdOB stars. Most spectra in these major clusters form connected sequences in PC space. Using a second stage of PCA and SC, we identify sub-clusters within 4 major clusters, particularly in the He-sdB/OB and iHe-sdB/OB clusters. In comparison with traditional MK-like classification, we find that the PC clusters are reasonably well separated, with some overlap at cluster boundaries. For very hot sdOs, where the number of standards is small, PC classification has led to a revision of the Drilling MK-like system. Gaia DR3 measurements have been used to determine kinematic parameters for the PC-defined classes. Although disk stars account for a significant fraction of all classes, He-sdOs and Hot-sdOs include a higher fraction of halo stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion onto ultra dense dark matter halos and direct collapse black holes</a><span class="id">[2601.02104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We suggest a formation scenario of black holes with intermediate mass $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, by post recombination Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion into ultra dense dark matter halos (UDMH) of $\sim 10^5 M_\odot$, which have formed around the recombination epoch. Such UDMH can result from rare curvature fluctuations on small scales whose amplitude is still well below the current Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectral distortion limits. Gas accreted by the UDMH is heated to virial temperatures above which atomic cooling is efficient, cools rapidly to about $\sim 8000$ K and collapses on the free fall time of few $10^4$ yr to the halo core, until supported by rotation. Further fragmentation due to molecular cooling is prevented by the suppression of $H_2$ molecule formation by the CMB photons at redshifts $z&gt; 200-400$. We find that the rotationally supported gas disk will be compact and massive enough to undergo self-gravitational instability in some cases, plausibly where accretion is into a nearly spherical UDMH which has formed from a rare peak in the density field. This results in a further, rapid transfer of mass inwards due to viscous forces and gravitational torques leading to the formation of a supermassive star and/or black hole of about $10^3 M_\odot$ at redshifts of a few hundred, with abundances comparable to galaxies. Such intermediate mass black holes formed at high redshifts can seed the first super massive black holes and help explain the abundance of active galaxies detected now at increasingly larger redshifts by the James Webb Space Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Converging on the eccentricity of massive black hole binaries in galactic mergers</a><span class="id">[2601.02133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binaries of supermassive black holes (MBHBs) represent the primary sources of the gravitational wave background (GWB) detectable by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). The eccentricity with which binaries form in galactic mergers is the key parameter determining their evolutionary timescale from pairing to coalescence. However, accurately determining the binary eccentricity at formation is difficult in simulations due to stochastic effects. We present a numerical study of the formation and evolution of MBHBs that are potential PTA sources. We simulate mergers of equal-mass galaxies on different initial orbits and follow the dynamics of the MBHBs through the hardening phase. We find that low-resolution simulations are affected by stochasticity due to torques from the stellar distribution acting at pericentre passages. The dispersion in binary eccentricity decreases with increasing central resolution, as expected for a Poisson process. We provide a fitting formula for the resolution requirement of an N-body simulation of MBHB formation and evolution as a function of the initial eccentricity of the merger, e0, and the required accuracy in the binary eccentricity, eb. We find that binaries experience a torque at first pericentre that is approximately independent of initial eccentricity, producing a general trend in which the binary eccentricity decreases above sufficiently large initial orbital eccentricities. While this behaviour is generic, the precise cross-over eccentricity (e0 0.97 in our models) and the sharpness of the drop-off depend on the galaxy initial conditions. We provide a fitting formula for eb(e0) that can be used in semi-analytical models to determine the merger timescales of MBHBs as well as the amplitude and slope of the GWB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NIRISS PASSAGE Spectroscopic Redshift Catalog in COSMOS</a><span class="id">[2601.02220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the Parallel Application of Slitless Spectroscopy to Analyze Galaxy Evolution (PASSAGE) spectroscopic redshift catalog in the COSMOS field.

NaD absorption profiles reveal that 3 out of 13 exhibit blueshifted absorption indicative of outflows, and a further 2 objects show signs of inflowing gas. Outflow velocities range from $\approx$ 300 - 1200 kms$^{-1}$, and we find gas flows are detected exclusively in objects that quenched $\lt$ 600 Myr ago. This result holds when we include comparable objects from recent literature. We derive mass outflow rates over two orders of magnitude higher than current levels of star formation in our sample, indicating that the winds are unlikely to be driven by supernovae, and likely play a significant role in keeping the galaxies quenched. The majority of the outflow sample have anomalously high energy and momentum outflow rates compared to those predicted for current levels of star formation or AGN activity. We conclude that we are likely observing fossil outflows driven by previous, more luminous AGN activity which has since faded. We then compare with the EAGLE simulation to explore a potential 'outflow cycle', finding that our observations are consistent with a model in which z $\sim$ 3 quiescent galaxies undergo short $\simeq$ 5 Myr periods of AGN activity strong enough to drive outflows, which occur every $\simeq$ 40 Myr on average. This AGN activity drives observable outflows that persist for up to $\simeq$ 10 Myr after the AGN fades, followed by a $\simeq$ 20 Myr lull, and a subsequent short inflow, which eventually re-ignites AGN activity, and the cycle repeats.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking for observational signatures of early binary black hole systems</a><span class="id">[2601.02288]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. A lot of recent studies have focused on the observables associated with near merger binary black-holes (BBHs) embedded in a circumbinary disk (CBD) but we still we lack knowledge of observables of BBHs in their early stage. In that stage the separation between the two black holes is so large that both black holes could potentially retain their individual accretion disk existing before the creation of the BBH. For such early BBH systems, it is interesting to look for observables originating in those individual disks whose structure is likely to differ from mini-disks often observed in simulations of later stages of BBHs. Aims. In a companion paper we presented a set of hydrodynamical simulations of an individual disk surrounding a primary black hole while being impacted by the presence of a secondary black-hole in an early BBH system, leading to the creation of three well-known characteristic features in the disk's structure. Here we explore the imprints of these three features on the observables associated with the thermal emission of the pre-existing black hole disk. The aim is two-fold, first to see which observables are best suited for detecting those early systems and, secondly, what could be extrapolated about these systems from observations. Methods. We used general relativistic ray-tracing in order to produce synthetic observations of the thermal emission emitted by early BBHs with different mass ratio and separations in order to search for distinctive observational features of early systems. Results. We found that in the case of early BBH with pre-existing disk(s) a necessary, although not unique, observational feature is the truncation of their disk(s). Conclusions. Such observable could be used for automated search of potential BBHs and discriminate some existing candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Polarization and Magnetic Field of the Radio Arc as Observed by ALMA at 100 GHz</a><span class="id">[2601.02297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The unique Galactic Center non-thermal filaments (NTFs) have been a focus of investigations for over 40 years. The most prominent manifestation of the NTFs is a bundle of parallel filaments known as the Radio Arc. Radio polarimetric observations made with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 10 GHz have revealed an alternating magnetic field pattern in the Radio Arc that could either be a result of multiple field systems being encountered along the line of sight or an intrinsic feature of the Radio Arc. These VLA observations were not able to distinguish between these possibilities due to the large rotation measures encountered towards the source. We present ALMA 100 GHz observations of the Radio Arc that are not impacted by significant Faraday effects. The observations reported here represent both the first time that ALMA has been used to study the NTFs and the first time 100 GHz polarimetric observations have been conducted on the Radio Arc. We find a uniformly rotated magnetic field with respect to the NTF filament orientation, with the angle of rotation being constant along the length of each filament. However, we find a systematically different magnetic field orientation in different Radio Arc filaments. We use this field pattern to update our understanding of the line-of-sight structures local to the Radio Arc. We find that the magnetic field inferred from our ALMA observations is likely a result either of confusion from multiple magnetic field systems or because the polarization is centrally concentrated within the NTF filaments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies in Enzo (FOGGIE).

We find the O VI-bearing gas exists as a diffuse halo around the galactic disk, while the Mg II-bearing gas is more centrally located. We investigate the covering fraction, probability of co-observation, co-kinematic correspondence of these ions using two different analysis methods. We make both mock sightlines using two-dimensional projections of our simulations treating these cells as integrated lines of sight and we create one-dimensional ray objects and use the SALSA (Boyd et al. 2020) code to investigate individual gas structures that contribute most to the line of sight column densities, which we call mock absorbers. We explore the relative kinematics of these mock absorbers and find Mg II and O VI appear to have a co-kinematic relationship when looking at absorber pairs with the closest relative velocity like in Werk et al. (2016). However, this does not necessarily correspond with a close spatial separation meaning many O VI and Mg II absorber pairs only appear to be co-kinematic but are physically unrelated. Taking a more holistic look at Mg II and O VI absorber pairs reveals a much weaker correlation between these two ions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological redshift of a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole: Towards estimating the Hubble constant</a><span class="id">[2601.00989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk.

The size increases with repulsive coupling parameter $\beta$ in both potentials. A clear scaling law of the size with $\beta^{1/3}$ emerges in the MOND case and is confirmed numerically over a wide parameter range, while for the Newtonian potential no simple scaling law exists as the Thomas-Fermi approximation ceases to be valid. For the dynamics, we derive and solve equations for the monopole collective mode. The larger MOND-bound condensate oscillates at a lower frequency, which scales as $\beta^{-1/3}$ in the strong-interaction limit.

To assess dust extinction within our sample, we combine Pa$\alpha$ fluxes with archival H$\alpha$ data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 G141 grism. Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between dust extinction and galaxy stellar mass, where more massive galaxies exhibit greater dust extinction. We employ two-dimensional Pa$\alpha$ and F444W mapping to trace the distributions of star formation and stellar mass, respectively. Our observations indicate that lower mass galaxies are almost dust free in Pa$\alpha$ and exhibit smaller sizes both in star formation and underlying stellar continuum. In contrast, galaxies with a stellar mass greater than $10^{9.5}M_\odot$ display diverse dust extinction and star formation patterns. This variation suggests that the structures and properties of massive galaxies evolve through different phases, which involve, e.g., star formation in massive clumps, compaction, and inside-out quenching. This study demonstrates the capabilities of JWST WFSS in conducting systematic investigations of emission line galaxies and highlights the pivotal role of Pa$\alpha$ in advancing our understanding of dust extinction and obscured star formation in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The BoRG-$JWST$ Survey: Abundance and Mass-to-light Ratio of Luminous $z=7-9$ Galaxies from Independent Sight Lines with NIRSpec</a><span class="id">[2408.00843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new results on the rest-frame UV luminosity function (UVLF) and stellar mass-to-light (M/L) ratio of bright (M$_{\rm UV}\lesssim-20$ mag) spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $z=7-9$ derived from the BoRG-$JWST$ survey, a unique data set of NIRSpec prism follow up of $HST$-selected sources from random-pointing imaging.

We find that the bright end of the UVLF is higher than found using imaging over $JWST$ legacy fields, suggesting the latter may be significantly affected by cosmic variance, and thus reducing the tension with recent findings from $JWST$ at $z&gt;10$ and comparable to models invoking little dust attenuation and bursty star formation. Additionally, we use the galaxies' $JWST$ spectra to infer their stellar masses and M/L ratios relative to other $HST$ and $JWST$ studies. We show that the stellar mass scales almost linearly with UV luminosity (M$_* \propto L_{\rm UV}^{0.85\pm0.12}$), albeit with large ($\sim0.5$ dex) intrinsic scatter, consistent with stochastic bursts of star formation in early galaxy formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs (ID-MAGE): The Search for Satellites Around Low-Mass Hosts</a><span class="id">[2504.00253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from ID-MAGE (Identifying Dwarfs of MC Analog GalaxiEs), a survey aimed at identifying and characterizing unresolved satellite galaxies around 36 nearby LMC- and SMC-mass hosts (D$=$4$-$10 Mpc). We use archival DESI Legacy Survey imaging data and perform an extensive search for dwarf satellites, extending out to a radius of 150 kpc ($\sim$$R_{vir}$). We identify 355 candidate satellite galaxies, including 264 new discoveries. Extensive tests with injected galaxies demonstrate that the survey is complete down to $M_V\sim-$9.0 (assuming the distance of the host) and $\mu_{0,V}\sim$26 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (assuming a n$=$1 Sérsic profile). We perform consistent photometry, via Sérsic profile fitting, on all candidates and have initiated a comprehensive follow-up campaign to confirm and characterize candidates. Through a systematic visual inspection campaign, we classify the top candidates as high-likelihood satellites. On average, we find 4.0$\pm$1.4 high-likelihood candidate satellites per LMC-mass host and 2.1$\pm$0.6 per SMC-mass host which is within the range predicted by cosmological models. We use this sample to establish upper and lower estimates on the satellite luminosity function of LMC/SMC-mass galaxies. ID-MAGE nearly triples the number of low-mass galaxies surveyed for satellites with well-characterized completeness limits, providing a unique dataset to explore small-scale structure and dwarf galaxy evolution around low-mass hosts in diverse environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HI 21-cm Absorption Associated with Foreground Galaxies on Top of Quasars</a><span class="id">[2504.01079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A systematic search for HI 21-cm absorption in Quasar-Galaxy Pairs (QGPs) provides a powerful means to map the distribution of cold gas around high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Fiber spectroscopy of high-redshift quasars enables the serendipitous detection of foreground star-forming galaxies at extremely small impact parameters, forming a unique subset of QGPs known as Galaxies On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs). In this study, we present results from a pilot upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) survey of three GOTOQs, where we achieved a remarkable 100% detection rate of HI 21-cm absorption. By combining our findings with existing literature, we establish that GOTOQs constitute a distinct population in terms of HI 21-cm absorption, with significantly higher detection rates than those observed in Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ (DLA)-based or metal absorption-based searches. For the GOTOQs, we find a strong correlation between the line-of-sight reddening and the HI 21-cm optical depth, characterized by $\int \tau\, dv\, (\rm{km\,s^{-1}}) = 13.58^{+2.75}_{-2.35} E(B-V) + 0.68^{+1.06}_{-1.27}$, consistent with the Milky Way sightlines. We also show that the HI 21-cm detection rates and optical depth declines rapidly with the impact parameter. With upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys expected to substantially expand the catalog of known GOTOQs, the success of this pilot survey lays the foundation for constructing a statistically significant sample of intervening HI 21-cm absorbers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Properties and Velocity Dispersion-Mass Relation of $z \sim 1$ Galaxy Clusters from the GOGREEN and GCLASS Surveys</a><span class="id">[2505.12110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a sample of 14 galaxy clusters from the GOGREEN and GCLASS (GG) spectroscopic datasets within the redshift range $(0.87 \leq z \leq 1.37)$ and cluster masses $\mathrm{M}_{200} \gtrsim 2\times 10^{14}$ \hm. Using the highly effective GalWeight technique for cluster membership assignment developed by our own team, we derive the dynamical parameters of these clusters through the virial mass estimator. We examine the velocity dispersion-cluster mass relation $(\sigma \mathrm{MR})$ for the GG cluster sample. We find, $\log{\sigma_{200}} = (2.94\pm0.02) + (0.37\pm0.07)\log{\mathrm{M}_{200}}$ with an intrinsic scatter of $(\sigma_\mathrm{int} = 0.02 \pm 0.02)$.

AGNBoost constructs 66 input features from 7 NIRCam and 4 MIRI bands to predict the fraction of mid-IR $3$–$30\,\mu$m emission attributable to an AGN power law ($\text{frac}_{\text{AGN}}$) and photometric redshift. Each model is trained on $10^6$ simulated galaxies from CIGALE. Models are tested on mock CIGALE galaxies, an independent set of empirically-derived templates, and 748 observations from the JWST MIRI EGS Galaxy and AGN (MEGA) survey. On idealized noise-free mock CIGALE galaxies, AGNBoost achieves $15\%$ outlier fractions of $1.63\%$ ($\text{frac}_{\text{AGN}}$) and $0.15\%$ (redshift), with $\sigma_{\text{RMSE}} = 0.045$ for $\text{frac}_{\text{AGN}}$ and $\sigma_{\text{NMAD}} = 0.004$ for redshift. When realistic photometric uncertainties are introduced, performance remains robust with median predictions on the 1:1 relation, though outlier fractions increase to $4.38\%$ and $3.35\%$, respectively. On the independent template set, AGNBoost identifies $92.6\%$ of AGN candidates with $\text{frac}_{\text{AGN}} &gt; 0.3$ and $100\%$ with $\text{frac}_{\text{AGN}} &gt; 0.5$, demonstrating generalization beyond the training distribution. On MEGA galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, AGNBoost achieves $\sigma_{\text{NMAD}} = 0.056$ and $19.79\%$ outliers. AGNBoost $\text{frac}_{\text{AGN}}$ estimates broadly agree with CIGALE fitting ($\sigma_{\text{RMSE}} = 0.178$, $11.96\%$ outliers). The flexible framework allows straightforward incorporation of additional photometric bands and re-training for other variables.

Most of the LRDs with existing spectral observations exhibit broad Balmer lines and are thus likely to host active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Here we present a study of LRDs with no broad H-alpha component. Our sample consists of five LRDs at z 5 with H-alpha line widths of about 250 km/s. They are selected from 32 LRDs that have NIRSpec high- or medium-resolution grating spectra covering H-alpha. During our construction of the sample, we find that approximately 20 percent of the LRD candidates previously selected do not show red continuum emission but resemble the V-shape spectra due to strong line emission. Compared to normal star-forming galaxies, narrow-line LRDs tend to have relatively higher H-alpha line widths and luminosities. If these LRDs are dominated by galaxies, our SED modeling suggests that they are dusty, compact star-forming galaxies with high stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs). Alternatively, if their SEDs are produced by AGNs, the inferred central black hole masses (MBH) are in the range of 10^5 to 10^6 solar masses, placing them at the low-mass end of the AGN population. They may represent an early stage of super-Eddington growth, where the black holes have yet to accumulate significant masses. With large measurement uncertainties, these black holes appear slightly overmassive relative to the local MBH-Mstar relation, but consistent or undermassive with respect to the MBH-sigma and MBH-Mdyn relations. We further find that nearly half of the high-redshift broad-line AGNs exhibit V-shape SEDs.

Blending introduces a challenge to weak-lensing cosmology probes since such blends are subject to shear signals from multiple redshifts. This effect can be described by joining shear bias and redshift characterisation in the effective redshift distribution, $n_{\gamma}(z)$, which includes the response of apparent shapes of detected objects to shear of galaxies at redshift, $z$. In this work, we propose a novel method to correct $n_{\gamma}(z)$ for redshift-mixed blending by emulating the shear response to neighbouring galaxies. We designed a `half-sky-shearing' simulation with Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) wide-like specifications, which allowed us to extract the response of a detected object's measured ellipticity to the shearing of neighbouring galaxies among numerous galaxy pairs. We demonstrate the feasibility of accurately emulating these pairwise responses and validate the robustness of our approach under varying observing conditions and galaxy population uncertainties. We find that the effective redshift of sources at the high-redshift tail of the distribution is about 0.05 lower than expected when the effect is not modelled. Given adequately processed image simulations, our correction method can be readily incorporated into future cosmological analyses to mitigate this source of systematic error.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking enhanced star formation and quenching to faint tidal features in galaxies</a><span class="id">[2507.21050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy mergers and interactions have long been suggested as a significant driver of galaxy evolution. However, the exact extent to which mergers enhance star formation and AGN activity has been challenging to establish observationally. In previous work, we visually classified a sample of galaxies with various types of faint tidal features in DECaLS images. In this paper, we cross-correlate this sample with a principal component analysis of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to investigate how the presence of these features, as well as their specific nature, correlates with intense star formation and AGN activity. Averaged over all tidal classes, we find that tidal feature galaxies are 10.3$\pm$1.5 times more likely to be in a starburst phase, and 24.3$\pm$5.0 times more likely to have rapidly quenched (post-starbursts), than those in a mass-matched control sample. Examining differences between tidal classes, galaxies with \textit{arm} features are 1.4$\pm$0.2 times more likely to be starbursting than the other categories, while those with \textit{shell} features are 2.7$\pm$0.6 times more likely to be in a quiescent state. In a similar analysis, we identify which galaxies show evidence of AGN activity and find no significant difference between the fraction of those with or without tidal features. Overall, our results reinforce the notion that mergers play an important role in driving star formation and rapid quenching in galaxies, and provide some of the first empirical evidence that the strength of this effect has a dependence on the detailed nature of the interaction, as traced by the tidal feature morphology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MUSEQuBES: Physical conditions, origins, and multi-element abundances of the circumgalactic medium of an isolated, star-forming dwarf galaxy at z=0.57</a><span class="id">[2510.06310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In dwarf galaxy models, outflows expel metal-enriched interstellar medium (ISM) into the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to reproduce their observed low metallicities, but measurements of dwarf CGM properties are scarce.

A background quasar sightline with archival UV spectra probes the dwarf's CGM at a projected distance of 28 kpc, corresponding to approximately half of the estimated virial radius. The dwarf's CGM is detected in \ion{H}{1}, intermediate metal ions of \ion{C}{3}, \ion{O}{3}, \ion{O}{4}, and \textcolor{black}{\ion{S}{5}}, and kinematically broader, highly-ionized \ion{O}{6}, but is undetected in \ion{N}{4} and \ion{Ne}{8}. Photoionization modeling of the intermediate ions indicates a modest volume-filling factor ($\sim 6\%$ along the sightline or $\sim 2\%$ globally), and a mass of $\sim2\times10^8 {\rm\,M_\odot}$, $\sim4\times$ higher than the dwarf's stellar mass, but $\sim10\times$ less than the highly ionized CGM. The \ion{O}{6} kinematics are comparable to the dwarf's estimated virial velocity, suggesting it is likely associated with cool, photoionized, and volume-filling CGM, with bulk motion or turbulence dominating over thermal pressure. The metallicity inferred for the intermediate ions is $\rm [O/H]=-0.6$, but with low relative abundances of $\rm [C/O]=-0.6$ and \textcolor{black}{$\rm [N/O]&lt;-1.0$}. The [N/O] is below levels expected of the dwarf's ISM, but consistent with core-collapse supernova ejecta, suggesting that supernova-enriched gas escaped the dwarf without mixing significantly with ISM enriched in nitrogen from evolved, low-mass stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and phase-mixed galaxies to the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2510.17968]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), beyond the current JWST detection limits ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$). Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to $\sim50\%$ of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at $z =6-9$. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of $\sim2-3$ and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by $\sim20-40\%$. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near $M_\star$ $\sim$ $10^{5}$ $M_\odot$ or $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \sim -10$ at $z \gtrsim 6$. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim -15$ to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction ($\sim50\%$) of streams with $M_\star$ $\gtrsim$ $10^{6}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0$ should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnetic fields of the dusty nuclei and molecular outflows of Arp 220</a><span class="id">[2510.26570]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy mergers trigger starburst activity and galactic outflows that enrich the circumgalactic medium, profoundly impacting galaxy evolution.

We perform ALMA $870~\mu$m dust continuum polarization and CO(3-2) emission line polarization, and report the first detection of CO(3-2) emission line polarization through the Goldreich-Kylafis effect in an outflow. Dust polarization shows that Arp 220 E has a spiral-like B-field on the disk with a linear polarization fraction of $0.4\pm0.1$% that may produce the detected circular polarization passing through foreground aligned dust grains. Arp 220 W reveals a B-field parallel to the red- and blueshifted outflows in both the dust and emission line polarization maps. The outflows show a dust polarization of $0.2$%, while the CO(3-2) emission line polarization is $1-2$% at $4-6\sigma$ significance across independent velocity channels. A highly polarized ($3-5$%) dusty bridge has a B-field orientation of $\sim110^{\circ}$ connecting both nuclei. Mean B-field strengths of $1.6$ mG and $8$ mG for the blue- and redshifted outflows, respectively, are estimated. These strong B-fields are attributed to amplification by compression in nuclear clouds and supernova remnants. This amplified B-field is likely sustained by the turbulent kinetic energy in the outflow and may be critical in directing the transport of metals and cosmic rays into the circumgalactic medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2511.00397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams, and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars.

The short-lived, sporadic, and anisotropic nature of radio activities, coupled with the detection of abundant cold gas around some massive quiescent galaxies, raise questions about the efficiency of radio feedback in massive galaxies. Here we present an innovative method rooted in artificial intelligence to separate galaxies in which radio feedback is effective (RFE), regardless of current radio emission, from those in which radio feedback is ineffective (RFI), according to their optical images. Galaxies categorized as RFE are all dynamically hot, whereas quiescent RFI (RFI-Q) galaxies usually have extended cold-disk components. At given stellar mass, dark matter halos hosting RFE galaxies are between four to ten times more massive than those of RFI-Q galaxies. We find, for the first time, that almost all RFE galaxies have scant cold gas, irrespective of AGN activity. In contrast, many RFI-Q galaxies are surrounded by substantial amounts of condensed atomic gas, indicating a different evolutionary path from RFE galaxies. Our finding provides direct and compelling evidence that a radio AGN has gone through about 300 on-off cycles and that radio feedback can prevent gas cooling over a timescale much longer than that of radio activity. Contrary to general belief, our analysis shows that only a small fraction of massive galaxies are influenced by strong radio AGNs, suggesting that current galaxy formation models need serious revision.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The longest known tails of ram-pressure-stripped star-forming galaxies are caused by an intracluster medium shock in Abell 1367</a><span class="id">[2512.15660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution of cluster galaxies through mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping (RPS), whose effect may be enhanced in merging clusters.

The galaxies are members of the nearby ($d=92$ Mpc) merging cluster Abell 1367 and are located in proximity to an intracluster medium (ICM) shock that is traced by X-ray observations and the presence of a radio relic. We analyzed LOFAR and MeerKAT observations at frequencies of 54, 144, 817, and 1270 MHz to perform a detailed spectral analysis of the tails. We found that all three tails are significantly more extended than in previous radio studies, with lengths of $\geq70$ kpc. For UGC 6697, we detected a tail of 300 kpc, making it the longest known RPS tail of a star-forming galaxy at any wavelength. The length and spectral variations of the tail cannot be explained purely by the spectral aging of stripped cosmic rays. We construct a model of the tail that includes compression and re-acceleration due to the encounter with the nearby ICM shock, which can plausibly account for the extreme RPS as well as the length and spectral variation of the tail. We further discover a radio plume at the leading edge of UGC 6697 that connects to a narrow filament. These sources exhibit extremely steep ($\alpha\approx-1.7$) and highly curved spectra. We speculate that this emission arises from cosmic rays re-energized by UGC 6697's rapid infall that propagate along magnetic filaments in the cluster center. Our findings represent direct evidence of a cluster merger shock impacting the evolution of member galaxies. Furthermore, we report the first tentative detection of particle acceleration at the leading edge of an infalling galaxy.</p></div></details></article>

A key development is a nonlinear neutrino-matter coupling algorithm based on nested fixed-point iteration with Anderson acceleration, enabling fully implicit treatment of collisional processes, including energy-coupling interactions such as neutrino-electron scattering and pair production. Coupling to finite-volume (FV) hydrodynamics is achieved with a hybrid DG-FV representation of the fluid variables and operator-split evolution in Flash-X. The implementation is verified using basic transport tests with idealized opacities and relaxation and deleptonization problems with tabulated microphysics. Spherically symmetric CCSN simulations demonstrate accuracy and robustness of the coupled scheme, including close agreement with the CCSN simulation code Chimera. An axisymmetric CCSN simulation further demonstrates the viability of DG-based neutrino transport for multidimensional supernova modeling within Flash-X. thornado's neutrino-transport solver is GPU-enabled using OpenMP offloading or OpenACC, and all CCSN applications included in this work use the GPU implementation.

While current O4 sensitivity limits post-merger detections to  20 Mpc ( 1 detection per century), this methodology provides essential infrastructure for third-generation detectors (Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer) where post-merger detection will become routine with annual detection rates exceeding 100 events. Our validation framework identifies expected behavior in uncertainty scaling that reflects realistic training constraints rather than idealized Fisher information limits, demonstrating honest assessment practices for machine learning applications in gravitational wave astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerating cosmological simulations on GPUs: a step towards sustainability and green-awareness</a><span class="id">[2601.01935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The increasing complexity and scale of cosmological N-body simulations, driven by astronomical surveys like Euclid, call for a paradigm shift towards more sustainable and energy-efficient high-performance computing (HPC). The rising energy consumption of supercomputing facilities poses a significant environmental and financial challenge. In this work, we build upon a recently developed GPU implementation of pinocchio, a widely-used tool for the fast generation of dark matter (DM) halo catalogues, to investigate energy consumption. Using a different resource configuration, we confirmed the time-to-solution behavior observed in a companion study, and we use these runs to compare time-to-solution with energy-to-solution. By profiling the code on various HPC platforms with a newly developed implementation of the Power Measurement Toolkit (PMT), we demonstrate an 8x reduction in energy-to-solution and 8x speed-up in time-to-solution compared to the CPU-only version. Taken together, these gains translate into an overall efficiency improvement of up to 64x. Our results show that the GPU-accelerated pinocchio not only achieves substantial speed-up, making the generation of large-scale mock catalogues more tractable, but also significantly reduces the energy footprint of the simulations. This work represents an step towards “green-aware&quot; scientific computing in cosmology, proving that performance and sustainability can be simultaneously achieved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for identifying pulsar candidates in radio surveys using scintillation</a><span class="id">[2601.02097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our previous paper, we developed a technique for identifying pulsar candidates in interferometric radio images using their distinctive scintillation signatures. Building on this technique, the present study simulates a pulsar population using the PsrPopPy Python module to investigate the technique's limitations and detection capabilities. Among pulsars detectable exclusively by this technique, 50% have duty cycles exceeding the mean value of 0.09 observed in time-domain detections. Our pulsar population simulations revealed a set of observational parameters that optimize pulsar detection. An observation frequency of   1420 MHz and a channel width of  10 kHz emerge as the optimal configuration to maximize the pulsar detection efficiency. By applying a scintillation-based technique to future radio telescopes like DSA-2000, we can detect 56% of normal pulsars and 84% of MSPs in addition to those detected using non-imaging, time-domain surveys. These detected pulsars cannot be verified by time-domain searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can instrumental effects obscure the true photospheric wave spectrum?</a><span class="id">[2601.02155]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Optical aberrations and instrument resolution can affect the observed morphological properties of features in the solar atmosphere. However, little work has been done to study the effects of spatial resolution on the dynamical processes occurring in the Sun's atmosphere. In this work, owing to the availability of high-resolution observations of a magnetic pore captured with the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer mounted at the Dunn Solar Telescope, we studied the impact of the diffraction limit and the sampling of an instrument on line-of-sight Doppler velocity oscillations. We reported a noticeable shift in the dominant frequency band from $5$ to $3$ mHz, as both the angular and detector resolutions of the instruments were degraded. We argue that the observed behaviour is a result of the increased contamination of straylight from neighbouring quiet Sun regions, masking the true behaviour of umbral oscillations. These results suggest that the wave energy contributions reported in the literature and based on low-resolution instrumentation may be fundamentally underestimated. As we move into the era of high-resolution instrumentation such as DKIST and MUSE, this work will offer a critical baseline for interpreting new observations, especially in terms of distinguishing true dynamic behaviours from artefacts introduced by instrument-related limitations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncovering Hidden Systematics in Extreme-Precision Radial Velocity Measurements</a><span class="id">[2601.02296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We identify and correct for small but coherent instrumental drifts in seven years of radial velocity data from the EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES). The systematics are most notable for the six months before and after 2022 January, when EXPRES experienced larger temperature variations, and we see a systematic trough-to-peak amplitude of 2.8 m/s in the radial velocities. This is large enough to mimic or obscure planetary signatures. To isolate and correct these effects, we develop a suite of diagnostics that track two-dimensional échellogram shifts, scalings, and rotation, as well as line bisector spans (LBS) derived from laser frequency comb (LFC) lines. By combining these empirical tracers with instrument telemetry in a multi-dimensional regression, we reduce the EXPRES instrument trend traced with solar RVs from an RMS of 1.32 m/s to 0.43 m/s, a 67% improvement, and the aggregate of twelve chromospherically quiet stars show a 26% reduction in velocity scatter. Our injection-recovery simulations further demonstrate a doubling in sensitivity to low-amplitude planetary signals after correction. When applied to the stellar time series of $\rho$ Coronae Borealis ($\rho$CrB), the correction removes a spurious planet d signal, restoring the integrity of the data. These results highlight the need for long-term monitoring and multi-dimensional calibration diagnostics on the path toward true centimeter-per-second precision in next-generation EPRV instruments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunting for &quot;Oddballs&quot; with Machine Learning: Detecting Anomalous Exoplanets Using a Deep-Learned Low-Dimensional Representation of Transit Spectra with Autoencoders</a><span class="id">[2601.02324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study explores the application of autoencoder-based machine learning techniques for anomaly detection to identify exoplanet atmospheres with unconventional chemical signatures using a low-dimensional data representation. We use the Atmospheric Big Challenge (ABC) database, a publicly available dataset with over 100,000 simulated exoplanet spectra, to construct an anomaly detection scenario by defining CO2-rich atmospheres as anomalies and CO2-poor atmospheres as the normal class. We benchmarked four different anomaly detection strategies: Autoencoder Reconstruction Loss, One-Class Support Vector Machine (1 class-SVM), K-means Clustering, and Local Outlier Factor (LOF). Each method was evaluated in both the original spectral space and the autoencoder's latent space using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics. To test the performance of the different methods under realistic conditions, we introduced Gaussian noise levels ranging from 10 to 50 ppm. Our results indicate that anomaly detection is consistently more effective when performed within the latent space across all noise levels. Specifically, K-means clustering in the latent space emerged as a stable and high-performing method. We demonstrate that this anomaly detection approach is robust to noise levels up to 30 ppm (consistent with realistic space-based observations) and remains viable even at 50 ppm when leveraging latent space representations. On the other hand, the performance of the anomaly detection methods applied directly in the raw spectral space degrades significantly with increasing the level of noise. This suggests that autoencoder-driven dimensionality reduction offers a robust methodology for flagging chemically anomalous targets in large-scale surveys where exhaustive retrievals are computationally prohibitive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compensating Star-Trackers Misalignments with Adaptive Multi-Model Estimation</a><span class="id">[2601.01130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents an adaptive multi-model framework for jointly estimating spacecraft attitude and star-tracker misalignments in GPS-denied deep-space CubeSat missions. A Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) estimates attitude, angular velocity, and gyro bias, while a Bayesian Multiple-Model Adaptive Estimation (MMAE) layer operates on a discrete grid of body-to-sensor misalignment hypotheses. In the single-misalignment case, the MEKF processes gyroscope measurements and TRIAD-based attitude observations, and the MMAE updates a three-dimensional grid over the misalignment vector. For a dual-misalignment configuration, the same MEKF dynamics are retained, and the MMAE bank is driven directly by stacked line-of-sight measurements from two star trackers, forming a six-dimensional grid over the two misalignment quaternions without augmenting the continuous-state dimension. A novel diversity metric, $\Psi$, is introduced to trigger adaptive refinement of the misalignment grid around a weighted-mean estimate, thereby preventing premature collapse of the model probabilities and concentrating computation in the most likely region of the parameter space. Monte Carlo simulations show arcsecond-level misalignment estimation and sub-degree attitude errors for both estimation problems, with estimation errors remaining well-bounded, proving robustness and consistency. These results indicate that the proposed MEKF–MMAE architecture enables accurate, autonomous, and computationally efficient in-flight calibration for resource-constrained spacecraft, and establishes dual star-tracker misalignment estimation as a practical option for deep-space CubeSat missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calorimetric Measurement of the Surface Energy of Enstatite, MgSiO$_3$</a><span class="id">[2601.01314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Surface thermodynamics of minerals influence their properties and occurrence in both terrestrial and planetary systems. Using high-temperature oxide melt solution calorimetry, we report the first direct measurement of the surface energy of enstatite, MgSiO$_3$. Enstatite nanoparticles of different sizes were synthesized using the sol-gel method, characterized with X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, infrared spectroscopy, surface area measurements, and electron microscopy. The materials consist of crystallites with sizes of $\sim $10 - 20 nm, which are agglomerated into larger nanoparticles. Thus, both surface and interface terms contribute to the measured enthalpies. Analysis based on calorimetry and calculated surface and interface areas gives the surface enthalpy of enstatite as 4.79 $\pm$ 0.45 J m$^{-2}$. This value is comparable to that of forsterite (Mg$_2$SiO$_4$) and larger than those of many nonsilicate oxide materials. This large surface energy may present a barrier to the nucleation of enstatite in planetary atmospheres and other geochemical and planetary environments. The interfacial energy of enstatite appears to be close to zero. The transition enthalpy from bulk orthoenstatite to bulk clinoenstatite is 0.34 $\pm$ 0.93 kJ mol$^{-1}$, which is in agreement with earlier reports. The methodology developed here can be extended to other materials having complex structures and morphologies to separate surface and interfacial contributions to energetics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FFCz: Fast Fourier Correction for Spectrum-Preserving Lossy Compression of Scientific Data</a><span class="id">[2601.01596]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper introduces a novel technique to preserve spectral features in lossy compression based on a novel fast Fourier correction algorithm\added{ for regular-grid data}. Preserving both spatial and frequency representations of data is crucial for applications such as cosmology, turbulent combustion, and X-ray diffraction, where spatial and frequency views provide complementary scientific insights. In particular, many analysis tasks rely on frequency-domain representations to capture key features, including the power spectrum of cosmology simulations, the turbulent energy spectrum in combustion, and diffraction patterns in reciprocal space for ptychography. However, existing compression methods guarantee accuracy only in the spatial domain while disregarding the frequency domain. To address this limitation, we propose an algorithm that corrects the errors produced by off-the-shelf “base” compressors such as SZ3, ZFP, and SPERR, thereby preserving both spatial and frequency representations by bounding errors in both domains. By expressing frequency-domain errors as linear combinations of spatial-domain errors, we derive a region that jointly bounds errors in both domains. Given as input the spatial errors from a base compressor and user-defined error bounds in the spatial and frequency domains, we iteratively project the spatial error vector onto the regions defined by the spatial and frequency constraints until it lies within their intersection. We further accelerate the algorithm using GPU parallelism to achieve practical performance. We validate our approach with datasets from cosmology simulations, X-ray diffraction, combustion simulation, and electroencephalography demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving critical scientific information in both spatial and frequency domains.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sequential Monte Carlo goes NUTS: Boosting Gravitational-Wave Inference</a><span class="id">[2601.02336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods have recently been applied to gravitational-wave inference as a powerful alternative to standard sampling techniques, such as Nested Sampling.

However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation. The inference results can be reproduced through our publicly available code base light.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19758" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report on LEO satellite impacts on ground-based optical astronomy for the Rubin Observatory LSST</a><span class="id">[2509.19758]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In August 2025 a workshop was convened to bring together experts to better understand steps that can be taken to mitigate the impact of satellite constellations on astronomical observations. At the time, just over 12,000 operational satellites were in low-Earth orbit (LEO). Although reflected sunlight and emissions all across the electromagnetic spectrum from artificial satellites impact scientific observations and the sky, the workshop focused on reflected sunlight in the wavelength range 330 nm to 1100 nm. This aligns with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) planned imaging observations over the coming decade. Among other conclusions, we affirm previous recommendations that tracked satellite apparent magnitudes should be no brighter than 7th AB mag. The workshop participants discussed over 30 publications, reports, and presentations, and arrived at the Findings and Recommendations presented here. During the workshop, in addition to affirming many existing recommendations and best practices, the group discovered new issues and devised possible mitigations. These were nearly equally divided between advice to satellite builders and operators and to the observational astronomy community. While the workshop prioritized considerations for LSST, our hope is that many of the Findings and Recommendations will also apply to other observatories and constellations, and that all satellite companies will continue to engage in dialog with sky observers across the globe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linear Image Regridding and Coaddition with Oversampled Point Spread Functions: Lessons from 1D</a><span class="id">[2510.16110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Image regridding and coaddition have a wide range of applications in astronomical observations. {\sc Imcom}, an algorithm that provides control over point spread function (PSF) and noise in coadded images, has been found to meet the stringent requirements of weak gravitational lensing cosmology with the forthcoming Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. In this work, I introduce a new algorithm, Fast {\sc Imcom}, which outperforms traditional {\sc Imcom} in terms of both efficiency and quality. After explaining the underlying philosophy and mathematical formalism, I conduct systematic comparisons between {\sc Imcom} and Fast {\sc Imcom} in terms of PSF reconstruction in 1D. While a 2D implementation is beyond the scope of this paper, I demonstrate how to generalize Fast {\sc Imcom} to 2D and discuss practical issues involved.

Meanwhile, it provides implications for the dithering patterns of Roman surveys (extrapolated from 1D to 2D). I also address potential applications of Fast {\sc Imcom} beyond the Roman HLIS, with focus on other weak lensing programs and Roman time domain surveys; the actual range of use cases is likely beyond what is discussed here.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Synoptic Array Science: Searching for Long Duration Radio Transients with the DSA-110</a><span class="id">[2510.18136]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We describe the design and commissioning tests for the DSA-110 Not-So-Fast Radio Burst (NSFRB) search pipeline, a 1.4GHz image-plane single-pulse search sensitive to 134ms-160.8s radio bursts.

The NSFRB search operates in real-time, utilizing a custom GPU-accelerated search code, \texttt{cerberus}, implemented in Python with JAX. We summarize successful commissioning sensitivity tests with continuum sources and pulsar B0329+54, estimating the 90% completeness $25\sigma$ flux (fluence) limit to be  1200mJy ( 160Jy ms). Future tests of recovery of longer timescale transients, e.g. CHIME J1634+44, are planned to supplement injection testing and B0329+54 observations. An offline DSA-110 NSFRB Galactic Plane Survey was conducted to search for LPRTs, covering $-3.5^\circ&lt;b&lt;5.7^\circ$ and $141^\circ&lt;l&lt;225^\circ$ ( 770 square degrees) in Galactic coordinates.

It is planned to be launched in 2027 into an equatorial low-Earth (530 km) orbit with a prime mission duration of 2 years. The observation of MeV gamma rays is dominated by background, mostly from extragalactic and atmospheric photon but also from the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background for the first 3 months in orbit, and we extrapolate the results to 2 years in orbit, in order to determine the build-up of the activation due to long-lived isotopes. We determine the rates of events induced by the background that are reconstructed as Compton events in the simulated COSI data. We find that the extragalactic background photons dominate at low energies (&lt;660 keV), while delayed activation from cosmic-ray primaries (proton/alpha) and albedo photons dominate at higher energies. As part of this work, a comparison at low latitude (&lt;1 deg) between recent measurement of the SAA by the High-Energy Particle Detector (HEPD-01) on board the China Seismo-Electromagnetic Satellite (CSES-01) and the AP9/AE9 model has been made, showing an overestimation of the flux by a factor 9 by the model.

Given availability of an optical quality shortpass filter material with strong blocking density in the SWIR, lower cost instrumentation, and higher performance filters could be designed. We demonstrate monopotassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP, chemical formula KH$_2$PO$_4$) as a strong candidate for this purpose. KDP is fully transparent at wavelengths from ultraviolet to 1.3$\mu$m, but becomes highly opaque at wavelengths &gt;2$\mu$m. We demonstrate on-sky use of KDP by improving performance of a cryogenic broadband filter with known off-band thermal leak, and using a non-cryogenic narrow band filter for deep observation. KDP reduces the sky background by 4.5 magnitudes in the leaky Z-band filter we use. Our 4nm wide, central wavelength 1.191$\mu$m narrowband filter in combination with KDP reduces the sky surface brightness by three magnitudes compared to a J broadband, although the effect of KDP is minor due to high blocking density of the broadband filter. We find a sky surface brightness of 18.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ in our bandpass at 1.191$\mu$m. KDP is an excellent thermal blocker, when its temperature is maintained above its Curie point at 123K. Below Curie point, KDP transforms its crystal structure, degrading its otherwise good imaging properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2512.16971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena.

Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments.
