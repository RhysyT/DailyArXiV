Implemented in JAX, jFoF achieves end-to-end acceleration by performing all neighbor searches, label propagation, and group construction directly on GPUs, eliminating costly host–device transfers. We introduce two complementary neighbor-search strategies, a standard k-d tree and a novel linked-cell grid, and demonstrate that jFoF attains up to an order-of-magnitude speedup compared to optimized CPU implementations while maintaining consistent halo catalogs. Beyond performance, jFoF enables gradient propagation through discrete halo-finding operations via both frozen-assignment and topological optimization modes. Using a topological optimization approach via a REINFORCE-style estimator, our approach allows smooth optimization of halo connectivity and membership, bridging continuous simulation fields with discrete structure catalogs. These capabilities make jFoF a foundation for differentiable inference, enabling end-to-end, gradient-based optimization of structure formation models within GPU-accelerated astrophysical pipelines. We make our code publicly available at this https URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk Formation and the Size-sSFR Relation of Dwarf Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.26875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dwarf galaxies are dark matter-dominated systems that are sensitive to feedback and display a diversity of baryonic morphologies. This makes them excellent probes for understanding dark matter and galaxy evolution. This work investigates the physical processes that influence the sizes of isolated dwarf galaxies using high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of $39$ dwarf galaxies drawn from the Marvelous Massive Dwarfs simulation suite ($7.5 &lt; \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 9.1$). Our simulations show that dwarf galaxies initially form as compact galaxies ($R_e &lt; 2$ kpc). However, several of these galaxies ($54\%$) experience periods of gradual size growth at relatively stable sSFR, allowing them to become extended galaxies. We find that the growth of rotation-supported stellar disks is the primary means by which isolated dwarfs become extended in size. These stellar disks are formed by mergers with high orbital angular momentum satellites on high angular momentum (spiraling-in) orbits, which spin up the gas surrounding the central galaxy and contribute $\approx 30 \%$ of the cold gas mass at $z=0$. For these systems, star formation in the angular momentum supported gas and the gradual build up of stars in the disk result in secular size growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metallicity Gradients in Modern Cosmological Simulations II: The Role of Bursty Versus Smooth Feedback at High-Redshift</a><span class="id">[2510.26877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The distribution of gas-phase metals within galaxies encodes the impact of stellar feedback on galactic evolution. At high-redshift, when galaxies are rapidly assembling, feedback-driven outflows and turbulence can strongly reshape radial metallicity gradients. In this work, we use the FIRE-2, SPICE, Thesan and Thesan Zoom cosmological simulations – spanning a range of stellar feedback from bursty (time-variable) to smooth (steady) – to investigate how these feedback modes shape gas-phase metallicity gradients at $3&lt;z\lesssim11$. Across all models, we find that galaxies with bursty feedback (FIRE-2, SPICE Bursty, and Thesan Zoom) develop systematically flatter (factors of $\sim2-10$) metallicity gradients than those with smooth feedback (SPICE Smooth and Thesan Box), particularly at stellar masses $M_\star &gt; 10^{9}~{\rm M_\odot}$. These results demonstrate that bursty stellar feedback provides sufficient turbulence to prevent strong negative gradients from forming, while smooth stellar feedback does not generically allow for efficient radial redistribution of metals thereby keeping gradients steep. Finally, we compare with recent observations, finding that the majority – but, notably, not all – of the observed gradients may favor a bursty stellar feedback scenario. In all, these results highlight the utility of high-resolution observations of gas-phase metallicity at high-redshift as a key discriminator of these qualitatively different feedback types.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shooting for the stars: Jet-mode feedback and AGN jet deceleration from stellar mass-loading</a><span class="id">[2510.26881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AGN jets are thought to be vital ingredients in galaxy evolution through the action of kinetic feedback; however, how narrow, relativistic outflows couple to galaxies remains an open question. Jet deceleration, which is often attributed to the entrainment of material, such as stellar winds, is thought to be necessary for efficient coupling. We present a simple model of jet deceleration due to stellar mass-loading to investigate the energy budget of direct jet feedback in the local Universe. To this end, we produce models of stellar mass-loss, including deriving a prescription for main sequence mass-loss rates as a function of stellar population age. We pair this mass-loss data with a parametric fit for radio AGN incidence, predicting that a majority of jets are decelerated within their hosts, and generally replicate the expected FR-II fraction in LERGs. We calculate that $\gtrsim$25\% of the jet power in the local Universe is efficiently decelerated and available for direct feedback within galaxies for any stellar population age. This fraction is largely invariant to the shape of the radio AGN incidence function at low jet Eddington fractions. The stellar mass-loss rate evolves significantly over time, approximately following $\tau^{-1.1}$, leading to corresponding decreases in decelerated jet power in older stellar populations. Although asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars dominate mass-loss at all ages, we find that their stochasticity is important in low-mass galaxies, and derive a critical jet power below which main sequence stars alone are sufficient to decelerate the jet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the AGN tori at cosmic noon using high-resolution JWST imaging and simultaneous SED fitting</a><span class="id">[2510.26884]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is evidence for significant evolution in the gaseous and dust properties of galaxies since the era of cosmic noon ($1\lesssim z\lesssim 2.5$). The well known co-evolution of supermassive black holes with their host galaxies suggests a constant connection between the small-scale (nuclear) and large-scale regions of galaxies. A fundamental component of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is the &quot;torus&quot;, a dense, dusty structure that acts as the interface between the accretion disc and the ISM of the host galaxy. The transitional nature of the torus makes it a prime subject to search for evolution since cosmic noon. We use high-resolution near- and mid-IR imaging from the JWST CEERS program to disentangle the emission from the torus in unprecedented detail for 88 X-ray selected AGN at $z\sim2$. We employ a novel SED fitting technique that combines archival low-resolution multi-band photometry at UV to FIR wavelengths with the new high-resolution JWST photometry to constrain essential AGN and torus parameters, such as accretion disc luminosity, torus opening angle, and inclination angle. We demonstrate that this SED fitting approach leads to better AGN characterisation and tighter constraints on AGN parameters. The population-level analysis finds that the Covering Fraction ($CF$) distribution peaks at $\approx0.25$ with a long tail towards higher $CF$. Despite the well-known evolution of the ISM and structural properties of AGN hosts to these redshifts, the $CF$ distribution of our sample does not show any strong statistical difference with that found in local AGN of equivalent luminosity, or with those at intermediate redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High$-z$ [OI] emission lines: ColdSIM simulations and ALMA observations</a><span class="id">[2510.26885]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutral-oxygen [OI] far-infrared emission lines at $63\mu$m and $145\mu$m are powerful probes of the physical conditions in the interstellar medium, although they have not been fully exploited in high-redshift studies. We investigate the connection between [OI] emission lines and key galaxy properties, such as star formation rate (SFR) and H$_2$ content. Our predictions are compared with existing observations and new data analysed in this work. We post-process the outputs of the ColdSIM cosmological simulations with the DESPOTIC model, taking into account [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption by cold foreground material. A Random Forest algorithm is employed to accelerate computations and new observational ALMA data for galaxies at redshift $z\simeq 5-7$ are used to validate our model. Our predictions show significant [OI]$63\mu$m luminosities ($\approx 10^8\,\rm L_\odot$) for galaxies with SFRs of $\approx 10^2\,\rm M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The $145\mu$m line luminosity is typically $15 \%$ the [OI]$63\mu$m one and is a factor $\approx 2-20$ below high-$z$ observations. Both [OI] lines correlate with SFR and molecular mass, but exhibit flattening in scaling relations with metallicity and stellar mass. Foreground self-absorption reduces the [OI] flux by a factor of $2-4$, consistent with empirical corrections in observational studies. We find typical line ratios of [OI]$63\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $\approx 1$ and [OI]$145\mu$m / [CII]$158\mu$m $ \approx 0.2 \, -$ consistent with $z\gtrsim 6$ observations, but only when [OI]$63\mu$m self-absorption is included. Both [OI]$63\mu$m and [OI]$145\mu$m lines serve as tracers of star formation and molecular gas at high redshift. Their joint detection can provide constraints on the properties of the early interstellar medium and self-absorption of the [OI]$63\mu$m line.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Luminosity Function of the Coma Cluster from Deep $u'-g'-r'$ Wendelstein Imaging Data</a><span class="id">[2510.26889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the $g'$ band galaxy luminosity function (GLF) of quenched red sequence in the Coma cluster from a deep-imaging survey with $\approx1.5\,\mathrm{deg^2}$ around the cluster center. The dataset comprises deep $u'$-, $g'$-, and $r'$-band data obtained with the Wendelstein Wide Field Imager on the 2.1 m Fraunhofer Wendelstein Telescope reaching median $3\sigma$ surface brightness limits in $10&quot;\times10&quot;$ boxes of $\mathrm{ (30.0\,u',\,\,29.6\,g',\,\,28.7\,r')\,mag\,arcsec^{-2}}$. We measure structural parameters across a large dynamic range in galaxy brightness ($-24.5\,g'\,\mathrm{mag} \lessapprox M\lessapprox-11.3\,g'\,\mathrm{mag}$), from the brightest cluster galaxy to low-luminosity dwarfs, including compact dwarf galaxies and ultra-diffuse galaxies. We automatically identify 5161 cluster member candidates based on their membership on the quiescent sequence in the $u'-g'$ versus $g'-r'$ color–color diagram and their red sequence membership. The structural parameters of bright galaxies are obtained via isophotal modeling, and fully automated parametric image fitting for faint ones. Injection-recovery tests and two identically analyzed reference fields provide statistical corrections for completeness and contamination, yielding a representative GLF that reliably probes the faint end and may serve as a benchmark for future studies. We report a best-fit double Schechter $g'$ band GLF with a comparatively steep faint-end slope $\alpha_2=-1.539^{+0.024}_{-0.024}$. We perform an apples-to-apples comparison with the Coma counterpart in the SLOW simulations, finding overall agreement but a deficit of bright and an excess of dwarf galaxies in the simulation, despite its shallower faint-end slope, highlighting the need for true apples-to-apples comparisons that consider both normalization and slope for a consistent interpretation of the GLF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26901" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal numerical convergence criteria for subhalo tidal evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.26901]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter subhalos and satellite galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations still suffer from the “overmerging” problem, where inadequate force and/or mass resolution cause artificially enhanced tidal mass loss and premature disruption. Previous idealized simulations addressing this issue have been restricted to a small subset of the subhalo orbital parameter space, and all assumed subhalos to be isotropic. Here, we present the first extensive simulation suite that quantifies numerical convergence in the tidal evolution of anisotropic subhalos under varying numerical resolutions and orbits. We report a universal force resolution criterion: the subhalo's instantaneous tidal radius must always be resolved by at least 20 cells in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)-based simulations, or by 20 softening lengths (Plummer equivalent) in tree-based simulations, regardless of refinement details or subhalo physical properties such as concentration or velocity anisotropy. We also report a universal expression for the discreteness-noise-driven scatter in the bound-mass fraction of subhalos that depends only on the subhalo mass resolution at infall and the instantaneous bound mass fraction, agnostic of any further subhalo properties. Such stochastic discreteness noise causes both premature disruption and, notably, spurious survival of poorly mass-resolved subhalos. We demonstrate that as many as 50 percent of all subhalos in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are likely to be either force and/or mass unresolved. Our findings advocate for adaptive softening or grid refinement based on the instantaneous tidal radius of the subhalo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can galactic magnetic fields diffuse into the voids?</a><span class="id">[2510.26918]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic voids are magnetized at the level of at least $10^{-17}$ G on Mpc scales, as implied by blazar observations. We show that an electrically conducting plasma is present in the voids, and that, because of the plasma, \emph{diffusion} into the voids of galactic fields generated by a mean-field dynamo is far too slow to explain the present-day void magnetization. Indeed, we show that even in the presence of turbulence in the voids, dynamo-generated galactic fields diffuse out to a galactocentric radius of only 200-400 kpc. Therefore, it is challenging to meet the required volume filling-factor of the void magnetic field. We conclude that a primordial origin remains the most natural explanation to the space-filling weak fields in voids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolved stars with inconsistent age estimates: Abundance outliers or mass transfer products?</a><span class="id">[2510.26927]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the Milky Way disk there is a strong trend linking stellar age to surface element abundances. Here we explore this relationship with a dataset of 8,803 red-giant and red-clump stars with both asteroseismic data from NASA Kepler Mission and surface abundances from the SDSS-V MWM. We find, with a k-nearest-neighbors approach, that the [Mg/H] and [Fe/Mg] abundance ratios predict asteroseismic ages to an accuracy of about 2 Gyr for the majority of stars. That said, there are substantial outlier stars whose surface abundances do not match their asteroseismic ages. Because asteroseismic ages for these stars are fundamentally based on density or mass, these outliers are mass-transfer candidates. Stars whose surface abundances predict a younger age (higher mass) than what's seen in the asteroseismology are mass accretor candidates (MAC); stars whose abundances predict an older age (lower mass) than the asteroseismology age are mass donor candidates (MDC). We create precise control samples, matched according to (1) surface abundances and (2) asteroseismic ages, for both the MAC and MDC stars; we use these to find slight differences in rotational velocity, [C/N], and [Na/Mg] between the mass-transfer candidates and their abundance neighbors. We find no drastic differences in kinematics, orbital invariants, UV excess, or other stellar abundances between outliers and their abundance neighbors. We deliver 377 mass-transfer candidates for follow-up observations. This project implicitly suggests a fundamental limit on the reliability of asteroseismic ages, and supports existing evidence that age-abundance outliers are products of binary mass transfer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting the IGM metal enrichment with the 2-point correlation function of the flux. Application to the UVES deep spectrum</a><span class="id">[2510.26947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The distribution and the abundance of metals in the intergalactic medium (IGM) have strong implications on galaxy formation and evolution models. The ionic transitions of heavy elements in quasar spectra can probe both the mechanisms and the sources of chemical pollution, but high resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectra are required, as the IGM absorbers can be too weak for direct detection. In this work, we investigate the IGM metallicity, focusing on the detection of the weak absorption lines. We exploited the cosmological tool of the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and applied it to the transmitted flux in the CIV forest of the ultra-high S/N UVES spectrum of the quasar HE0940-1050 (z 3). We also &quot;deabsorbed&quot; the strongest circum-galactic medium (CGM) systems to reveal the underlying IGM signal. For each test, we generated 1000 mock spectra with shuffled line positions to derive an estimate for the TPCF noise level. The TPCF shows a clear peak at the characteristic velocity separation of the CIV doublet, but when deabsorbing the CGM contribution (i.e. all metal lines and CIV lines associated with logN(HI)&gt;14.0), the peak is no longer significant at 1$\sigma$, although 7 weak CIV systems remain visible. Even adding up to 135 additional weak mock CIV systems (logN(HI)&lt;14.0) to the spectrum does not produce a significant CIV peak. Eventually, when we create a synthetic spectrum with gaussian distributed noise and same S/N as the complete spectrum, we remove the signal caused by the spectral intrinsic features and thus find a peak compatible with a metallicity of -3.80&lt;[C/H]&lt;-3.50. We conclude that the TPCF method is not sensitive to the presence of the weakest systems in the real spectrum, despite the extremely high S/N and high resolution of the data. However, the results of this statistical technique would possibly change when combining more than one line of sight.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identifying substructure associations in the Milky Way halo using chemo-kinematic tagging</a><span class="id">[2510.26952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way halo has been built-up over cosmic time through the accretion and dissolution of star clusters and dwarf galaxies as well as through their complex interactions with the Galactic disc. Traces of these accreted structures persist to the present day in the chemical and kinematic properties of stars and their orbits and allow for the disentangling of the accretion history of the Galaxy through observations of Milky Way stars. We utilised 6D phase-space information in combination with [Fe/H] measurements to facilitate a clustering analysis of stars using their kinematics and chemistry simultaneously, a technique known as chemo-kinematic tagging. Using t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE), we performed dimensionality reduction and identify stars from clusters and streams that are co-localised in the kinematic and chemical parameter space. We included E, Jr, Jz, Lz, r_apo, r_peri, and eccentricity as well as [Fe/H] as input into the algorithm, and used a sample of 5347 stars from 229 individual Milky Way substructures compiled from various sources in the literature. Most notably, we recovered several large-scale structures that have been reported in the literature, including GSE, Thamnos, Sequoia, I'itoi, LMS-1/Wukong, Sagittarius, Kraken/Koala, the splashed disc, and a candidate structure recently found in another work. We find that 44\% of Milky Way globular clusters are consistent with having an accreted origin. We also find that the chemo-dynamic properties of omega cen are consistent with a common accretion with the Thamnos structure. In addition, we identified many stream-progenitor associations, most notably a connection between the Orphan-Chenab stream and the Grus II ultra-faint dwarf galaxy, which supports previous findings that these two objects were brought into the Galaxy in the same accretion event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Critical Examination of the PAH Hypothesis</a><span class="id">[2510.26970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) hypothesis proposes that the aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) observed at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mic originate from gas-phase PAH molecules. These bands exhibit consistent peak wavelengths and profiles in diverse sources, and ISO SWS and JWST spectra show a nearly identical red wing of the 3.3 mic AIB and blue wing of the 11.2 mic AIB in the dominant Class A sources. This spectral uniformity suggests that the AIBs arise from a small, well-defined set of gas phase PAH species, regardless of the excitation conditions or the nature of the source such as HII regions, reflection nebulae, planetary nebula, young stellar objects, or the diffuse interstellar medium. However, a small number of gas phase PAH species is inconsistent with current modeling of the AIBs that require a wide range of PAH types and sizes. It is also inconsistent with the lack of observed UV and optical absorption bands from gas phase PAH molecules. Furthermore, there is no plausible formation pathway to produce only a small number of specific PAH molecules in the interstellar medium. These issues require quantitative investigation in order to definitively establish gas-phase PAH molecules as the carrier of the AIBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting Star Formation in the Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies. I. Comparability of Molecular Cloud Physical Properties</a><span class="id">[2510.26976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We used CO (2-1) and CO (1-0) data cubes to identify molecular clouds and study their kinematics and dynamics in three nearby galaxies and the inner Milky Way. When observed at similar spatial and velocity resolutions, molecular clouds in the same mass range across these galaxies show broadly comparable physical properties and similar star formation rates (SFRs). However, this comparability depends on smoothing Milky Way clouds to match the resolution of the extragalactic observations. The beam effect can artificially inflate cloud sizes, leading to inaccurate estimates of radius, density, and virial parameters. By comparing high-resolution and smoothed Milky Way data, we established criteria to exclude beam-affected clouds in the extragalactic sample. After applying this filter, cloud properties remain consistent across galaxies, though some clouds in NGC 5236 show elevated velocity dispersions, likely due to environmental effects. In the inner Milky Way, molecular clouds fall into two groups: those with clumps and those without. Clump-associated clouds are more massive, denser, have higher velocity dispersions, lower virial parameters, and stronger 8 \(\mu\)m emission, suggesting more intense feedback. Strong correlations are found between cloud mass and total clump mass, clump number, and the mass of the most massive clump. These results suggest that a cloud's physical conditions regulate its internal clump properties and, in turn, its star-forming potential.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supplementing the 2MRS survey: The 2MZoA catalogue</a><span class="id">[2510.26979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a homogeneous 2MASX galaxy catalogue at low Galactic latitudes (|b| &lt;= 10.0 deg, called Zone of Avoidance, ZoA) which is complete to a Galactic extinction-corrected magnitude of Ko &lt;= 11.75 mag. Also included are galaxies at higher latitudes in areas of high foreground extinctions (E(B-V) &gt; 0.95). This catalogue supersedes the previously presented bright 2MZoA catalogue which was only complete to Ko &lt; 11.25 mag. It fully complements the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS) galaxy catalogue, which has the same magnitude limit but excludes high extinction regions. The combination of the two catalogues, the extended 2MRS or e2MRS, is is a uniquely whole sky redshift survey and forms a sound basis for studies of large-scale structures, flow fields and extinction across the ZoA. The here presented catalogue comprises 6899 galaxies with 6757 galaxies at low latitudes and 142 galaxies in highly obscured high-latitude areas. The completion rate in redshifts is almost 75%. The catalogue is complete up to star density levels of at least log N_*/deg^2 &lt; 4.3, but the completion rate of the fainter part is affected by foreground extinction at all levels. This can be rectified by using a diameter-dependent extinction correction, adding 1083 highly obscured but apparently faint galaxies (with Ko &gt; 11.75 mag and Ko,d &lt;= 11.75 mag) to the sample. This extended sample shows good completion rates with extinction up to at least AK &lt; 1.3 mag. Omission of such a diameter-dependent extinction correction may lead to a biased flow field even at intermediate extinction values as found in the 2MRS survey. As in our previous investigations, we do not find a dependence of the correction factor f=0.86 to the extinction maps on Galactic longitudes or latitudes, but note a possible influence by cosmic variance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faint active galactic nuclei supplied 31-75% of hydrogen-ionizing photons at z&gt;5</a><span class="id">[2510.26990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of the ionizing photons that completed hydrogen reionization remains debated. Using recent JWST and ground-based surveys at 4.5 &lt;= z &lt;= 6.5, we construct a unified rest-UV AGN luminosity function that separates unobscured Type I and obscured Type II populations, and show that &quot;little red dots&quot; and X-ray selected sources are magnitude-filtered subsets of Type I with a mixture fraction eta = 0.10 +/- 0.02. We anchor the Lyman-continuum (LyC) escape fraction to outflow incidence and geometric clearing rather than assuming quasar-like values for all classes, and propagate uncertainties through a joint fit. Integrating over -27 &lt; M_UV &lt; -17, AGN inject Ndot_ion,AGN = (3.77 +1.08/-0.95) x 10^51 s^-1 Mpc^-3, nearly twice earlier estimates and comparable to the Ly-alpha inferred requirement at z   6. When combined with the JWST galaxy UV luminosity function and a harder stellar ionizing efficiency of log10(xi_ion) = 25.7, AGN contribute 31-75% of the total ionizing photons for representative galaxy escape fractions f_esc,gal = 0.03-0.20. The resulting hydrogen photoionization rate, Gamma_HI   (0.5-2) x 10^-12 s^-1 at z   5-6, lies squarely within the Ly-alpha forest constraints once mean free paths and IGM clumpiness are accounted for, remaining consistent for combined AGN-galaxy models up to f_esc,gal &lt;= 5%. These results suggest that AGN and galaxies jointly sustained the ionizing background during the final stages of reionization, with AGN remaining a major but not exclusive contributor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baryonic Masses and Properties of Gaseous Satellite Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.27019]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a sample of 127 gas-bearing dwarf galaxies around 56 late-type host galaxies within 30 Mpc using 21-cm HI data from the WALLABY, MHONGOOSE, and ALFALFA surveys. We characterize the environment of each dwarf galaxy based on its host galaxy halo and derive optical properties using the DESI Legacy Surveys for 110. The gaseous satellites span $\log (M_{\rm HI}/M_{\odot}) = 5.7-9.7$ and $\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) = 5.6-10.0$, with a median velocity line-width of $W_{50}=37$ km/s, comparable to the Local Group gaseous dwarf galaxies. We assess the HI mass sensitivity of the data by injecting model dwarf galaxies and find $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{6.7} M_{\odot}$ for WALLABY and $M_{\rm HI,lim} = 10^{5.4} M_{\odot}$ for MHONGOOSE at 10 Mpc. With this sensitivity, our sample shows lower average gas-to-stellar mass ratios ($M_{\rm HI}/M_{\star}$) than literature dwarf galaxy samples. The abundance of gaseous satellites per host is low and increases with host mass: $0-2$ for isolated dwarf galaxy hosts and $0-5$ for Milky Way-mass spiral hosts. These numbers are consistent with the Milky Way, M31, and star-forming satellite abundances from recent deep optical surveys. The inferred quenched fractions and gas-depleted satellites indicate that environmental quenching is effective in Milky Way-mass hosts, likely driven by gas stripping processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27036" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying Spectroscopic Flux Variations Between JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec: Slit Losses in Emission Line Measurements of z$\sim$1-3 Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.27036]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze JWST NIRISS and NIRSpec spectroscopic observations in the Abell 2744 galaxy cluster field. From approximately 120 candidates, we identify 12 objects with at least a prominent emission lines among \Oii, \Hb, \Oiiia, \Oiiib, and \Ha that are spectroscopically confirmed by both instruments. Our key findings reveal systematic differences between the two spectrographs based on source morphology and shutter aperture placement. Compact objects show comparable or higher integrated flux in NIRSpec relative to NIRISS (within 1$\sigma$ uncertainties), while extended sources consistently display higher flux in NIRISS measurements. This pattern reflects NIRSpec's optimal coverage for compact objects while potentially undersampling extended sources. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that NIRSpec recovers at least $63\%$ of NIRISS-measured flux when the slit covers $&gt;15\%$ of the source or when $R_e&lt;1$kpc. For lower coverage or larger effective radii, the recovered flux varies from $24\%$ to $63\%$. When studying the \Ha/\Oiiib emission line ratio, we observe that measurements from these different spectrographs can vary by up to $\sim$0.3 dex, with significant implications for metallicity and star formation rate characterizations for individual galaxies. These results highlight the importance of considering instrumental effects when combining multi-instrument spectroscopic data and demonstrate that source morphology critically influences flux recovery between slit-based and slitless spectroscopic modes in JWST observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comparison of Galacticus and COZMIC WDM Subhalo Populations</a><span class="id">[2510.27103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comparative analysis of warm dark matter (WDM) subhalo populations generated by the semi-analytic model {\sc Galacticus} and the COZMIC suite of dark matter-only $N$-body simulations.

Both models predict a suppression of low-mass subhalos correlated with decreasing WDM particle mass, and that WDM subhalos tend to have lower $V_\text{max} $ and larger $ R_\text{max} $ values than their CDM counterparts at fixed mass. While {\sc Galacticus} provides more statistically precise results due to a larger sample size, the COZMIC simulations display similar qualitative trends. We discuss how differences in halo finder algorithms, simulation resolution, and modeling assumptions affect subhalo statistics.

As the capabilities of imaging systems improve with time, confirming that our standard techniques adequately model the increasingly complex structures unveiled is essential. With JWST providing unprecedented image quality, we can test how measurements of galaxy morphology vary with the choice of point-spread function (PSF) and fitting software. We perform two-component Sérsic+PSF fits of the surface brightness profiles of 87 X-ray AGNs $(0.1 &lt; z &lt; 4)$ from the CEERS survey. We create model PSFs for NIRCam F115W imaging using both photutils and PSFEx. We find that PSFEx models consistently fail to match the radial profile of typical point sources within our sample. We then perform AGN–host decompositions on each source by creating Sérsic+PSF models using both Galfit and AstroPhot. We find that Galfit and AstroPhot converge to different regions of the parameter space, providing consistently differing host galaxy properties. While we can measure the AGN and host magnitudes accurately, we find that the host galaxy morphological parameters are not well-determined – the Sérsic index and effective radius are strongly covariant. Significant changes in the host galaxy parameters do not correspond to changes in the statistical quality of fit, nor to significant changes in the model's radial profile. These results indicate that the Sérsic profile does not uniquely well-represent typical AGN host galaxies in extragalactic survey fields. We also provide recommendations for studies of AGN hosts comparable to ours.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reproducing Abell 2744 with the HyperMillennium Simulation</a><span class="id">[2510.27291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the Hyper Millennium (HM) simulation, an extremely large cosmological simulation designed to support next-generation galaxy surveys.

We present here the first detailed theoretical study of the chemical evolution of fluorine at low metallicity by means of a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, in light of the most recent data for fluorine, which further pushed observations to lower metallicities down to [Fe/H]$\sim$-4 dex, more than a factor of 10 lower in metallicity than previous detections. We employ a state-of-the-art stochastic chemical evolution model to follow the evolution in the Galactic halo, which has been shown to reproduce well the main observables in this Galactic component and the abundance patterns of CNO and neutron-capture elements, and we implement nucleosynthesis prescriptions for fluorine, focusing on the chemical evolution of this element. By comparing recent observations with model predictions, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars at low metallicities to explain both the [F/Fe] vs [Fe/H] and [F/O] vs [O/H] diagrams. In particular, we showed that we can reach high [F/Fe]$\sim$2 dex at [Fe/H]$\sim$-4 dex, in agreement with recent observations at the lowest metallicity. With a stochastic chemical evolution model for the Galactic halo, we confirm the importance of rotating massive stars as fluorine producers, as hinted by previous studies using chemical evolution models for the Galactic disc. We also expect an important production of F at high redshift, in agreement with recent detections of supersolar N by JWST. Further data for fluorine at low metallicities and also at high redshift would be needed to put further constraints on the chemical evolution of fluorine and be compared to our theoretical predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacobi capture as a pathway to off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.27332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The recent detection of high-redshift supermassive black holes with JWST has renewed interest in the processes driving black hole growth.

Their ability to merge outside galactic centers may play a key role in shaping black hole mass assembly. Here, we investigate the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies hosting cored dark matter haloes, where long dynamical friction timescales and core stalling naturally arise. By embedding off-center black holes into an idealized galactic potential and scanning a wide range of orbital configurations, we assess the likelihood of close interactions through Jacobi capture. We find that captures occur in about 13% of cases. Such captures, possibly sustained within compact stellar systems like stripped nuclei or globular clusters, represent a crucial first step toward assembling massive black hole binaries beyond galactic centers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating the late stages of WD-BH/NS mergers: an origin for fast X-ray transients and GRBs with periodic modulations</a><span class="id">[2510.27399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies indicate that mergers of a white dwarf (WD) with a neutron star (NS) or a stellar-mass black hole (BH) may be a potential progenitor channel for certain merger-kind, but long-duration $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs), e.g., GRBs 230307A and 211211A. The relatively large tidal disruption radius of the WD can result in non-negligible residual orbital eccentricity ($0 \lesssim e \lesssim 0.2$), causing episodic mass transfer, i.e., repeated tidal disruptions (RPDs) of the WD. We perform smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of RPDs in sixteen WD-BH/NS systems, capturing the subsequent mass transfer and accretion. The WD undergoes RPDs near the orbital periastron, modulating the ensuing accretion process, leading to variations of the accretion rate on the orbital period. Across all simulations, the peak accretion rates range from $4 \times10^{-4}$ to 0.2 $M_{\odot} \rm \ s^{-1}$, while the RPD duration spans from $\sim$ 10 s to an hour. More compact systems, i.e., those with a higher mass ratio (higher WD mass and lower accretor mass), tend to undergo fewer RPD cycles, resulting in shorter durations and higher accretion rates. If such events can launch relativistic jets, three categories of non-thermal X/$\gamma$-ray transients are predicted, in decreasing order of their mean accretion rates: (1) an X-ray transient with a simultaneous GRB, both lasting for $10^{1-2}$ s; (2) a longer X-ray transient lasting up to $10^{2-3}$ s that has a GRB appearing only at its later phase ; (3) an ultra-long X-ray transient lasting for $\sim 10^{3}$ s without a GRB. A generic feature of these transients is that their prompt emission light curves are probably periodically modulated with periods of a few to tens of seconds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UV irradiation of ethanol-containing interstellar ice analogs: Photostability in CH3CH2OH:CO mixtures</a><span class="id">[2510.27422]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ethanol (CH3CH2OH) has been detected in interstellar ices within regions associated with the early stages of star and planet formation. Its solid-phase pathways can lead to diverse conditions that can significantly influence its photostability and -chemistry. Laboratory studies have explored the effects of energetic processing on pure ethanol ices, there is a gap in understanding how ethanol behaves in astrophysically relevant mixed ices. This proof-of-principle study aims to quantify how the ice composition influences the photostability of ethanol mixed with CO, from both physical and chemical perspectives. It also seeks to highlight the importance of balancing constructive and destructive processes. Mixtures with ethanol to CO ratios ranging from 1:0 to 1:11 are exposed to UV irradiation from a microwave discharge H lamp under UHV conditions, at 16 K. The evolution of the solid phase is tracked using reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, and changes in the gas phase are monitored with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Temperature-programmed desorption experiments aid in the identification of infrared spectral features. A radiative-transfer model has been developed to account for the influence of ice composition on the effective photon flux. The model reveals that, during later stages of irradiation, photoproducts play a significant role in the absorbing of incident photons, highlighting the complex cascade of processes initiated by single-photon absorption in ethanol-containing ices. By evaluating photodestruction cross sections as a function of the initial ice composition, we found that CO exerts a stabilizing effect on ethanol. For highly dilute ethanol:CO mixtures, representative of astronomical ices, the photodestruction cross section of ethanol is estimated to  1.6E-17 cm2/photon after correcting for the effective absorbed UV fluence of the studied interstellar ice analogs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-diffuse Galaxy Analogues in the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam Wide-field Clusters</a><span class="id">[2510.27459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform a systematic statistical study of ultra-diffuse galaxy analogues (NUDGEs) in a large sample of galaxy clusters to investigate their properties with respect to the host clusters.

The synthesis of PAHs from simpler precursors is known as the &quot;bottom-up&quot; theory, which, so far, has been dominated by reactions between organic radicals. However, this mechanism struggles to account for the origin of the smallest cycles themselves. Ion-molecule reactions emerge as promising alternative pathways to explain the formation of these molecules. In the present work, we investigate the reaction network of the main ionic precursor of cyclopentadiene c-C5H7+ . To this end, we establish an integrated protocol that combines astrochemical modelling to identify viable formation routes under cold interstellar medium conditions, automated reaction path search and kinetic simulations to obtain accurate descriptions of the reaction pathways and reliable rate constants. In particular, we examine the reaction between ethylene (C2H4) and the linear propargyl cation (CH2CCH+). Our results reveal that the formation of c-C5H7+ by radiative association turns out to be inefficient, contrary to our initial expectations. Instead, the system predominantly evolves through bimolecular channels yielding c-C5H5+ and CH3CCH2+ with the formation of c-C5H5+ offering new insights into reactivity that supports molecular growth in the ISM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DiffstarPop: A generative physical model of galaxy star formation history</a><span class="id">[2510.27604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH).

We study the development and properties of CGM turbulence driven by accretion in halo masses of $10^{10}-10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at redshifts $0\leq z\lesssim 2$, thus providing a baseline for additional turbulence driving processes such as galaxy feedback. Using analytic considerations and idealized hydrodynamical simulations we demonstrate that in halos with mass up to $\sim10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, even mild turbulent velocities near the virial radius of $\sigma_{\rm t}(R_{\rm vir})\sim 10\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$ are enhanced by the accretion process so that turbulent velocities are comparable to the virial velocity at inner CGM radii, with $\sigma_{\rm t}(0.1\,R_{\rm vir})\approx v_{\rm vir}\sim 100\,{\rm km \, s^{-1}}$. Rapid cooling at these inner radii further implies that thermal pressure support is small, and the gas is dominated by the cool and warm ($\sim10^4-10^5\,{\rm K}$) phases. Inner CGM energetics are thus dominated by turbulence, with gas density distributions and velocity structure functions similar to those seen in simulations of isothermal supersonic ISM turbulence, rather than those seen in subsonically turbulent stratified media such as the ICM. The gas accretion rate in these systems is regulated by the turbulence dissipation rate rather than by the cooling rate as in more massive halos. We argue that galaxy feedback is unlikely to qualitatively change our conclusions unless it continuously injects high specific energy material ($\gg v^2_{\rm vir}$) into the CGM. Such `turbulence-dominated' CGM can be identified in observations via the predicted wide lognormal ionization distributions and large velocity dispersions in UV absorption spectra, particularly in the inner CGM of $\sim L^\star$ and lower-mass halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Hole Envelopes in Little Red Dots</a><span class="id">[2505.06965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations by the James Webb Space Telescope have uncovered a population of compact, red object ($z\sim 4\text{--}7$) known as little red dots (LRDs). The presence of broad Balmer emission lines indicates active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes (BHs), while LRDs exhibit unusually weak X-ray and radio emission and low variability, suggesting super-Eddington accretion that obscures the central engine. We suggest that such an extreme accretion disc inevitably drives strong outflows, which would disrupt the LRDs themselves unless confined within the nuclear region – posing a general feedback problem for overmassive BHs. To resolve this, we propose that the BH is embedded in a massive, optically thick envelope that gravitationally confines the outflow, making any outflow a no-go. This envelope, powered by accretion on to the BH, radiates at nearly the Eddington limit, and is sustained by an infall of the interstellar medium at a rate on the order of $\sim 1 M_{\odot}~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. A photosphere emerges either within the envelope or in the infalling medium, with a characteristic temperature of $5000$ - $7000 {\rm K}$, near the Hayashi limit. The resulting blackbody emission naturally explains the red optical continuum of the distinct V-shaped spectrum observed in most LRDs. Furthermore, the dynamical time-scale at the photosphere, $\sim 0.01~{\rm pc}$, is consistent with the observed year-scale variabilities. The nuclear structure and spectral features of LRDs are shaped by this envelope, which not only regulates feedback but also acts as a gas reservoir that sustains rapid BH growth in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Mass Segregation in Dark Matter Halos</a><span class="id">[2505.22717]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the effect of stellar mass segregation driven by collisional relaxation within the potential well of a smooth dark matter halo. This effect is of particular relevance for old stellar systems with short crossing times, where small collisional perturbations accumulate over many dynamical timescales. We run collisional $N$-body simulations tailored to the ambiguous stellar systems Ursa Major 3/Unions 1, Delve 1 and Eridanus 3, modelling their stellar populations as two-component systems of high- and low-mass stars, respectively. For Ursa Major 3/Unions 1 (Delve 1), assuming a dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio of 10, we find that after 10 Gyr of evolution, the radial extent of its low-mass stars will be twice as large as (40 per cent larger than) that of its high-mass stars. We show that weak tides do not alter this relative separation of half-light radii, whereas for the case of strong tidal fields, mass segregation facilitates the tidal stripping of low-mass stars. We further find that as the population of high-mass stars contracts and cools, the number of dynamically formed binaries within that population increases. Our results call for caution when using stellar mass segregation as a criterion to separate star clusters from dwarf galaxies, and suggest that mass segregation increases the abundance of massive binaries in the central regions of dark matter-dominated dwarf galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Classification Scheme for X-ray Bright Type Ia Supernova Remnants Based on Their Circumstellar Interaction</a><span class="id">[2507.20828]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The parameter space for mass loss in Type Ia supernova progenitors is large, with different progenitor scenarios favoring different mass loss regimes.

The impact on molecular gas is of particular importance, as it serves as the primary fuel for SF. Our goal is to investigate the origin of turbulence and the emission of molecular gas, as well as low- and intermediate-ionization gas, in the inner few kpc of both AGN hosts and SF galaxies. We use JWST MIRI/MRS observations of a sample consisting of 54 galaxies at z&lt;0.1. We present fluxes of the H2 S(5)6.9091, [Ar II]6.9853, [FeII]5.3403, and [Ar III]8.9914 lines, along with velocity dispersion from W80. For galaxies with coronal emission, [Mg V]5.6098 is also included. Line ratios are compared to photoionization and shock models to explore the origin of the gas emission. AGNs exhibit broader emission lines than SFGs, with the largest velocity dispersions observed in radio-strong (RS) AGNs. H2 gas is less turbulent compared to ionized gas, while coronal gas presents higher velocity dispersions. The W80 values for the ionized gas exhibits a decrease from the nucleus out to radii of approximately 0.5–1 kpc, followed by an outward increase up to 2-3 kpc. In contrast, the H2 line widths generally display increasing profiles with distance from the center. Correlations W80 and line ratios such as H2 S(5)/[ArII] and [FeII]/[ArII] indicate that the most turbulent gas is associated with shocks, enhancing H2 and [FeII] emissions. We speculate that these shocked gas regions are produced by AGN outflows and jet-cloud interactions in AGN-dominated sources, while in SFGs, they may be created by stellar winds and mergers. This shock-induced gas heating may be an important mechanism of AGN (or stellar) feedback, preventing the gas from cooling and forming new stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPHEREx: Aromatics, Aliphatics and PAH Size across the Iris Nebula</a><span class="id">[2510.20919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.42$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.10$\pm$0.01. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.54$\pm$0.05 and -0.45$\pm$0.05, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM Observations of The Prototypical Cold Front in Abell 3667</a><span class="id">[2510.26405]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3667 with \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. Two observations, targeting the cluster X-ray core and the prototypical cold front, were performed with exposures of 105 ks and 276 ks, respectively. We find that the gas in the core is blueshifted by $v_z\sim-200$ km s$^{-1}$ relative to the brightest cluster galaxy, while the low-entropy gas inside the cold front is redshifted by $v_z\sim 200$ km s$^{-1}$. As one moves further off-center across the front, the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity changes significantly, by $\Delta v_z=535^{+167}_{-154}$ km s$^{-1}$, back to the value similar to that in the core. There are no significant LoS velocity gradients perpendicular to the cluster symmetry axis. These features suggest that the gas forming the cold front is flowing in the plane oriented along the LoS, supporting an offset merger scenario in which the main cluster has passed in front of the subcluster and induced rotation of the core gas in the plane perpendicular to the sky. The region just inside the front exhibits the largest LoS velocity dispersion seen across two pointings, $\sigma_z\sim420$ km s$^{-1}$, which can be interpreted as a developing turbulence or a projection of the LoS velocity shear within the front. The large LoS velocity jump across the cold front, combined with the lack of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the surface of the front, suggests some mechanism to suppress it. For example, a magnetic field with $B&gt;5\,\mu$G is required if the cold front is stabilized by magnetic draping.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact Accretion Disks in the Aftermath of Tidal Disruption Events: Parameter Inference from Joint X-ray Spectra and UV/Optical Photometry Fitting</a><span class="id">[2510.26774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-wavelength analysis of 14 tidal disruption events (TDEs)-including an off-nuclear event associated with an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy-selected for having available thermal X-ray spectra during their late-time UV/optical plateau phase. We show that at these stages, the full spectral energy distribution - X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry - is well described by a compact, yet standard accretion disk, the same disk which powers the X-rays at all times. By fitting up to three epochs per source with a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can be reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass ($M_{\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\bullet}$ values, which in this sample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic scaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\% credible interval $ &lt; \pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations (e.g., $L_{Bol}^{ disk} / L_{Edd} \propto T_p^4 \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1}$), TDE-specific physics correlations ($L_{plat} \propto M_{\bullet}^{2/3}$ and $R_{out}/r_g \propto M_{\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy correlations ($M_{\bullet}$-$M_{gal}$ and $M_{\bullet}$-$\sigma_{\star}$) naturally emerge from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently extended into the intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\bullet} &lt; 10^{5}$) regime. We discuss the implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling. We also review and discuss different methods for $M_{\bullet}$ inference in TDEs, and find that approaches based on physical models of the early-time UV/optical emission are not able to recover (at a statistically significant level) black hole-host galaxy scalings.</p></div></details></article>

Alternative photo-z methods have been developed, largely within the context of low-redshift optical surveys. Machine learning based approaches have gained footing in this regime, including those that utilize raw pixel information instead of aperture photometry. However, the efficacy of image-based algorithms on high-redshift, near-infrared data remains underexplored. Here, we test the performance of Detection, Instance Segmentation and Classification with Deep Learning (DeepDISC) on photometric redshift estimation with NIRCam images from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) program. DeepDISC is designed to produce probabilistic photometric redshift estimates directly from images, after detecting and deblending sources in a scene. Using NIRCam-only images and a compiled catalog of spectroscopic redshifts, we show that DeepDISC produces reliable photo-zs and uncertainties comparable to those estimated from template fitting using HST+JWST filters; DeepDISC even outperforms template fitting (lower scatter/fewer outliers) when the input photometric filters are matched. Compared with template fitting, DeepDISC does not require measured photometry from images, and can produce a catalog of 94000 photo-zs in  4 minutes on a single NVIDIA A40 GPU. While current spectroscopic training samples are small and incomplete in color-magnitude space, this work demonstrates the potential of DeepDISC for increasingly larger image volumes and spectroscopic samples from ongoing and future programs. We discuss the impact of the training data on applications to broader samples and produce a catalog of photo-zs for all JADES DR2 photometric sources in the GOOD-S field, with quality flags indicating caveats.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerating Radiative Transfer for Planetary Atmospheres by Orders of Magnitude with a Transformer-Based Machine Learning Model</a><span class="id">[2510.27050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radiative transfer calculations are essential for modeling planetary atmospheres.

High computational costs force numerical simplifications in large models (e.g., General Circulation Models) that degrade the accuracy of the simulation. Radiative transfer calculations are an ideal candidate for machine learning emulation: fundamentally, it is a well-defined physical mapping from a static atmospheric profile to the resulting fluxes, and high-fidelity training data can be created from first principles calculations. We developed a radiative transfer emulator using an encoder-only transformer neural network architecture, trained on 1D profiles representative of solar-composition hot Jupiter atmospheres. Our emulator reproduced bolometric two-stream layer fluxes with mean test set errors of  1% compared to the traditional method and achieved speedups of 100x.

However, achieving interpretable, likelihood-compatible compression and fast inference under weak model assumptions remains challenging. We propose a parameter-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) that aligns a data-driven latent representation with cosmological parameters while remaining compatible with standard likelihood analyses. The model achieves high-fidelity compression of the $D_\ell^{TT}$, $D_\ell^{EE}$, and $D_\ell^{TE}$ spectra into just 5 latent dimensions, with reconstruction accuracy exceeding $99.9\%$ within Planck uncertainties. It reliably reconstructs spectra for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios, even under parameter extrapolation, and enables rapid inference, reducing the computation time from $\sim$40 hours to $\sim$2 minutes while maintaining posterior consistency. The learned latent space demonstrates a physically meaningful structure, capturing a distributed representation that mirrors known cosmological parameters and their degeneracies. Moreover, it supports highly effective unsupervised discrimination among cosmological models, achieving performance competitive with supervised approaches. Overall, this physics-informed CVAE enables anomaly detection beyond $\Lambda$CDM and points to physically meaningful directions for refinement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SERVIMON: AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance and Real-Time Monitoring for Astronomical Observatories</a><span class="id">[2510.27146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Objective: ServiMon is designed to offer a scalable and intelligent pipeline for data collection and auditing to monitor distributed astronomical systems such as the ASTRI Mini-Array.

With broader wavelength coverage, sensitivity and higher resolution, JWST has enabled robust constraints on these properties, including detections of photochemical products. This advances the need for retrieval frameworks capable of navigating complex parameter spaces for accurate data interpretation. In this work, we introduce the emission retrieval module of NEXOTRANS, which employs both one- and two-stream radiative transfer approximations and leverages Bayesian and machine learning techniques for retrievals. It also incorporates approximate disequilibrium chemistry models to infer photochemical species like SO2. We applied NEXOTRANS to the JWST NIRCam and MIRI emission observations of WASP-69b, covering the 2-12 microns range. The retrievals place robust constraints on the volume mixing ratios (VMR) of H2O, CO2, CO, CH4, and potential SO2. The best-fit model, i.e, free chemistry combined with non-uniform aerosol coverage, yields a log(VMR) = -3.78 (+0.15/-0.17) for H2O and -5.77 (+0.09/-0.10) for CO2 which has a sharp absorption at 4.3 micron. The second best-fit model, the hybrid equilibrium chemistry (utilizing equilibrium chemistry-grids) combined with non-uniform aerosol yields a C/O of 0.42 (+0.17/-0.13) and a metallicity of log[M/H] = 1.24 (+0.17/-0.14), corresponding to approximately 17.38 times the solar value. This hybrid chemistry retrieval also constrain SO2 with a log(VMR) = -4.85 (+0.28/-0.29), indicating possible absorption features in the 7-8 microns range. These results highlight NEXOTRANS's capability to significantly advance JWST emission spectra interpretation, offering broader insights into exoplanetary atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Moonlit sky polarization patterns from Cerro Paranal</a><span class="id">[2510.27308]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the polarization patterns from the moonlit sky as observed from the European Southern Observatory at Cerro Paranal. The moonlit sky background can be significant in astronomical observations and thus be a source of contamination in polarimetric studies. Based on sky observations during full Moon with FORS2 in imaging polarimetric mode, we measure the polarization degree and intensity at different wavelengths and scattering angles from the Moon, and compare them to theoretical and phenomenological single and multiple scattering models. Single scattering Rayleigh models are able to reproduce the wavelength dependence of the polarization as long as strong depolarization factors that increase with wavelength are introduced. Intensity data, however, require the inclusion of single Mie scattering from larger aerosol particles. The best models that simultaneously fit polarization and intensity data, are a combination of both single scattering processes, Rayleigh and Mie, plus an unpolarized multiple scattering component. Both Mie and multiple scattering become more dominant at longer wavelengths. Other factors like cloud depolarization and the sunlight contribution during the twilight were also investigated. The present study underscores the importance of accounting for moonlight scattering to enhance the accuracy of polarimetric observations of astronomical targets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stacking transmission spectra of different exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2510.27386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In many areas of astronomy, spectra of different objects are co-added or stacked to improve signal-to-noise and reveal population-level characteristics. As the number of exoplanets with measured transmission spectra grows, it becomes important to understand when stacking spectra from different exoplanets is appropriate and what stacked spectra represent physically. Stacking will be particularly valuable for long-period planets, where repeated observations of the same planet are time-consuming. Here, we show that stacked exoplanet transmission spectra are approximately mathematically equivalent to spectra generated from the geometric mean of each planet's abundance ratios. We test this by comparing stacked and geometric mean spectra across grids of forward models over JWST's NIRSpec/G395H wavelength range (2.8-5.2$\mu$m). For two dominant species (e.g., H$_2$O and CO$_2$), the geometric mean accurately reflects the stacked spectrum if abundance ratios are self-similar across planets. Introducing a third species (e.g., CH$_4$) makes temperature a critical factor, with stacking becoming inappropriate across the CO/CH$_4$ boundary. Surface gravity exerts only a minor influence when stacking within comparable planetary regimes. We further assess the number of stacked, distinct sub-Neptunes with high-metallicity atmospheres and low-pressure cloud decks required to rule out a flat spectrum at $&gt;5\sigma$, as a function of both cloud deck pressure and per-planet spectral precision. These results provide guidance on when stacking is useful and on how to interpret stacked exoplanet spectra in the era of population studies of exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-band infrared imaging reveals dusty spiral arcs around the binary B[e] star 3 Puppis</a><span class="id">[2510.27591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>3 Puppis is the brightest known B[e] star. Recent work classifies this A-type object as a supergiant, yet the impact of its binarity on the circumstellar environment (CE) remains hard to characterize. To resolve its dusty region at 5-10 mas, we obtained mid-IR interferometric observations with VLTI/MATISSE over 3-12 {\mu}m. Because the (u,v) coverage supports imaging, we introduce a statistical interferometric-imaging workflow based on MiRA to generate averaged images: this systematic approach enables the selection of an optimal set of reconstructions, improving the robustness and fidelity of the recovered features. We also use SPARCO, an independent tool well suited to bright central objects embedded in fainter extended emission. Images from both tools in the L, M, and N bands agree and reveal an asymmetric, elongated feature  17 mas ( 10 au at 631 pc) southeast of the star with  20% density contrast. A second northwest asymmetry and a skewed inner rim are detected. Simple geometric modelling, guided by the MATISSE images, constrains the morphology, location, and flux of the CE and its asymmetries. The images are consistent with earlier VLTI measurements but expose a more complex CE with large-scale clumps in the southeast and northwest parts of the disc. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates that tidal spiral-wake perturbations from the central binary, dynamically excited at Lindblad resonances in the circumbinary disc, best explain the radial extent and curvature of the elongated structures seen in all bands.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poincaré Maps with the Theory of Functional Connections</a><span class="id">[2510.27626]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Poincaré maps play a fundamental role in nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory, offering a means to reduce the dimensionality of continuous dynamical systems by tracking the intersections of trajectories with lower-dimensional section surfaces. Traditional approaches typically rely on numerical integration and interpolation to detect these crossings, which can lead to inaccuracies and computational inefficiencies. This work presents a novel methodology for constructing Poincaré maps based on the Theory of Functional Connections (TFC). The constrained functionals produced by TFC yield continuous and differentiable representations of system trajectories that exactly satisfy prescribed constraints. The computation of Poincaré maps is formulated as either an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary value problem (BVP). For IVPs, initial conditions are embedded into the functional, and the intersection time with a specified section surface is determined. We demonstrate linear convergence to the Taylor series, thereby enabling accurate interpolation without resorting to numerical integration or external optimization. For BVPs, periodicity conditions are encoded to identify periodic orbits in a Three-Body Problem context. Furthermore, by enforcing periodic constraints, we show how to construct first recurrence maps. The methodology is also extended to non-autonomous systems, demonstrated through applications to a Four-Body Problem. The proposed approach achieves machine-level accuracy with modest computational effort, eliminating the need for variable transformations or iterative integration schemes with adaptive step-sizing. The results illustrate that TFC offers a powerful and efficient alternative framework for constructing Poincaré maps, computing periodic orbits, and analyzing complex dynamical systems, particularly in astrodynamical contexts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diurnal Variations of Lee Wave Clouds on Mars using Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI)</a><span class="id">[2510.27673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the diurnal behavior of lee wave clouds on Mars provides critical insight into the planet's mesoscale atmospheric dynamics and their interaction with surface topography.

Of 6,007,831 nighttime fires, zero were classified as low confidence, compared to an expected 696,908 under statistical independence (chi-squared = 1,474,795, p &lt; 10^-15, Z = -833). This pattern persists globally across all months, latitude bands, and both NOAA-20 and Suomi-NPP satellites. Machine learning reverse-engineering (88.9% accuracy), bootstrap simulation (1,000 iterations), and spatial-temporal analysis confirm this is an algorithmic constraint rather than a geophysical phenomenon. Brightness temperature analysis reveals nighttime fires below approximately 295K are likely excluded entirely rather than flagged as low-confidence, while daytime fires show normal confidence distributions. This undocumented behavior affects 27.9% of all VIIRS fire detections and has significant implications for fire risk assessment, day-night detection comparisons, confidence-weighted analyses, and any research treating confidence levels as uncertainty metrics. I recommend explicit documentation of this algorithmic constraint in VIIRS user guides and reprocessing strategies for affected analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scattered light noise due to dust particles contamination in the vacuum pipes of the Einstein Telescope</a><span class="id">[2510.26919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-sensitivity optical measurements such as those performed in interferometric gravitational wave detectors are prone to scattered light noise.

Ten coatings were bonded to fused silica substrates and one remained on the epitaxial growth wafer. The average phase difference on reflection between beams polarized along the fast and slow axes of the coating was found to be $\psi = 1.09 \pm 0.18$ mrad, consistent with values observed in high-finesse optical reference cavities using similar AlGaAs coatings. Scans of substrate-transferred coatings with diameters between 18 and 194 millimeters showed birefringence non-uniformity at a median level of $0.1$ mrad. A similar epitaxial multilayer that was not substrate transferred, but remained on the growth wafer, had by far the least birefringence non-uniformity of all mirrors tested at $0.02$ mrad. On the other hand, the average birefringence of the epi-on-wafer coating and substrate-transferred coatings was indistinguishable. Excluding non-uniformity found at the location of crystal and bonding defects, we conclude that the observed non-uniformity was imparted during the substrate transfer process, likely during bonding. Quantifying the impact on the scatter loss in a LIGO-like interferometer, we find that birefringence non-uniformity at the levels seen here is unlikely to have a significant impact on performance. Nonetheless, future efforts will focus on improved process control to minimize and ultimately eliminate the observed non-uniformity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pointing Accuracy Improvements for the South Pole Telescope with Machine Learning</a><span class="id">[2412.15167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present improvements to the pointing accuracy of the South Pole Telescope (SPT) using machine learning. The ability of the SPT to point accurately at the sky is limited by its structural imperfections, which are impacted by the extreme weather at the South Pole. Pointing accuracy is particularly important during SPT participation in observing campaigns with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which requires stricter accuracy than typical observations with the SPT. We compile a training dataset of historical observations of astronomical sources made with the SPT-3G and EHT receivers on the SPT. We train two XGBoost models to learn a mapping from current weather conditions to two telescope drive control arguments – one which corrects for errors in azimuth and the other for errors in elevation. Our trained models achieve root mean squared errors on withheld test data of $2.14''$ in cross-elevation and $3.57''$ in elevation, well below our goal of $5''$ along each axis. We deploy our models on the telescope control system and perform further in situ test observations during the EHT observing campaign in 2024 April. Our models result in significantly improved pointing accuracy: for sources within the range of input variables where the models are best trained, average combined pointing error improved 33%, from $15.9''$ to $10.6''$. These improvements, while significant, fall shy of our ultimate goal, but they serve as a proof of concept for the development of future models. Planned upgrades to the EHT receiver on the SPT will necessitate even stricter pointing accuracy which will be achievable with our methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</a><span class="id">[2510.15315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey – a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data – NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AstroVisBench: A Code Benchmark for Scientific Computing and Visualization in Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2505.20538]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are being explored for applications in scientific research, including their capabilities to synthesize literature, answer research questions, generate research ideas, and even conduct computational experiments. Ultimately, our goal is for these to help scientists derive novel scientific insights. In many areas of science, such insights often arise from processing and visualizing data to understand its patterns. However, evaluating whether an LLM-mediated scientific workflow produces outputs conveying the correct scientific insights is challenging to evaluate and has not been addressed in past work. We introduce AstroVisBench, the first benchmark for both scientific computing and visualization in the astronomy domain. AstroVisBench judges a language model's ability to both (1) create astronomy-specific workflows to process and analyze data and (2) visualize the results of these workflows through complex plots. Our evaluation of visualizations uses a novel LLM-as-a-judge workflow, which is validated against annotation by five professional astronomers. Using AstroVisBench we present an evaluation of state-of-the-art language models, showing a significant gap in their ability to engage in astronomy research as useful assistants. This evaluation provides a strong end-to-end evaluation for AI scientists that offers a path forward for the development of visualization-based workflows, which are central to a broad range of domains from physics to biology.</p></div></details></article></body>
