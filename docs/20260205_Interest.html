<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Florence to Fermions: a historical reconstruction of the origins of Fermi's statistics one hundred years later</a><span class="id">[2602.04484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aim of this paper is to retrace the path that led the young Enrico Fermi to write his paper on the statistics of an ideal monatomic gas. This discovery originated in his interest, which he had shown since his formative years, in the absolute entropy constant and in the problems he highlighted in Sommerfeld's quantization in the case of identical particle systems. The fundamental step taken by Fermi in writing his work on statistics was to apply the Exclusion Principle, formulated for electrons in an atom and which could therefore have been a pure effect due to dynamics, to a system of non-interacting particles.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Landscape of Undergraduate Astronomy and Astrophysics Degree Requirements</a><span class="id">[2602.03959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this document we summarize the results of a survey of undergraduate degree-granting programs conducted by the 2024-2025 American Astronomical Society Education Committee's Subcommittee on UndeRgraduate and Graduate Education (SURGE). Individuals from 78 institutions completed the survey, representing approximately 1000 majors annually and a majority of undergraduate Astronomy and Astrophysics degree-granting institutions. Information collected from participants include: degree names, degree types, course requirements, elective course options, and learning goals. Our report presents 9 key findings and 10 recommendations, and these are summarized in the preamble to the report. The recommendations are directed primarily to degree-granting departments and the American Astronomical Society, as the principal relevant professional organization, though we earnestly invite all members of the Astronomy and Astrophysics community to contribute to a broader discussion about these findings and recommendations. Appendix A of the report contains detailed descriptions of survey data analyses. Appendices B and C contain recommended undergraduate course requirements and learning goals, respectively. Our survey results show clearly that there is not currently community consensus about what knowledge and competencies an undergraduate Astronomy or Astrophysics degree should instill. This lack of cohesion is a problem for our community, as it dilutes the significance and interpretability of the credential for employers and graduate schools. We view this report as just the beginning of an important dialog, and we look forward to engaging with the Astronomy and Astrophysics community about our findings and recommendations through our feedback form at this http URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lessons Learned from Integrating Generative AI into an Introductory Undergraduate Astronomy Course at Harvard</a><span class="id">[2602.04389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We describe our efforts to fully integrate generative artificial intelligence (GAI) into an introductory undergraduate astronomy course. Ordered by student perception of utility, GAI was used in instructional Python notebooks, in a subset of assignments, for student presentation preparations, and as a participant (in conjunction with a RAG-encoded textbook) in a course Slack channel. Assignments were divided into GAI-encouraged and GAI-discouraged. We incentivized student mastery of the material through midterm and final exams in which electronics were not allowed. Student evaluations of the course showed no reduction compared to the non-GAI version from the previous year.</p></div></details></article></body>
