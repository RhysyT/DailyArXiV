First, I show that Penrose's singularity theorem is best understood as a theorem of incompleteness, it demonstrates the failure of specific spacetime models within General Relativity (or any theory incorporating the Raychaudhuri equation) under certain general conditions. Although this has been done before, I adopt a novel approach based on differentiating between physical and purely formal assumptions in the axiomatic foundation of general relativity. Next, I compare Penrose's result with Gödel's incompleteness theorem, highlighting key similarities and differences. Finally, I draw philosophical conclusions regarding the limits and prospects of our epistemic reconstructions of the physical world.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinite multiverses and where to find them?</a><span class="id">[2602.07053]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Have you ever watched superhero movies like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse?

Imagine shrinking down to the size of an atom. What you'd see wouldn't be like our everyday world at all! This is the realm of quantum physics, where the rules we know do not apply, where things exist everywhere and nowhere at once. The moment you observe something, it starts behaving differently. In this article, we will explore two of the many possible explanations for such phenomena, namely the Copenhagen interpretation and the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics. We will also try to answer the question of whether there are many copies of you roaming around in different universes, and why you haven't met one.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ABL Rule and the Perils of Post-Selection</a><span class="id">[2602.07402]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In 1964, Aharonov, Bergmann, and Lebowitz introduced their well-known ABL rule with the intention of providing a time-symmetric formalism for computing novel kinds of conditional probabilities in quantum theory. Later papers attached additional significance to the ABL rule, including assertions that it supported violations of the uncertainty principle. The present work challenges these claims, as well as subsequent attempts to salvage the original interpretation of the ABL rule. Taking a broader view, this paper identifies a subtle category error at the heart of the ABL rule that consists of confusing observables that belong to a single system with emergent observables that arise only for physical ensembles. Along the way, this paper points out other problems and fallacious reasoning in the research literature surrounding the ABL rule, including the misuse of post-selection, a reliance on pattern matching to classical formulas, and a posture of measurementism that takes experimental data as providing answers to interpretational questions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative and geometric times in physics, mathematics, logic, and philosophy</a><span class="id">[2404.06566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We distinguish two different concepts of time that play a role in physics: \textit{geometric time} and \textit{creative time}. The former is the time of deterministic physics and merely parametrizes a given evolution. The latter is instead characterized by real change, i.e. novel information that gets created when a non-necessary event becomes determinate in a fundamentally indeterministic physics. This allows one to give a naturalistic characterization of the present as the moment that separates the potential future from the determinate past. We discuss how these two concepts find natural applications in classical and intuitionistic mathematics, respectively, and in classical and intuitionistic logic, as well as how they relate to the well-known A- and B-theories in the philosophy of time. We acknowledge that we do not offer here a unified concept or a new philosophy of time. However, we contend that none of the existing philosophical accounts fully integrate both the geometric and creative concepts of time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event Horizons, Spacetime Geometry, and the Limits of Integrated Consciousness</a><span class="id">[2512.23105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>What happens to a unified conscious field when its physical implementation straddles a black hole event horizon? This paper addresses that question for integration-based theories, including Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and Predictive Processing. These views share a structural commitment: unity requires a single strongly connected component (SCC) in an effective causal graph over a finite integration window $\tau$. Using the standard black hole causal structure, I show that no SCC can span an event horizon. Any theory that ties unity to strong connectivity must therefore accept that a single conscious field cannot remain numerically identical and unified across such a configuration. From the perspective of the theories themselves, the outcome is bifurcation: each causally connected subsystem continues to satisfy the very structural criteria the theory declared necessary for a unified field. On any such view, the number and boundaries of unified conscious fields are therefore fixed not by the substrate alone but by the conjunction of its internal architecture with the relativistic causal structure of the spacetime it occupies, a dependency that ordinary spacetime conceals by supplying it so abundantly, but which an event horizon abruptly withdraws.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relative Information, Relative Facts</a><span class="id">[2510.11349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We offer a fresh perspective on the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics as a way of thinking about the world described by quantum theory based on quantifiable notions of information. This allows us to provide a definition of a relative fact, with no addition to orthodox quantum theory and no fundamentally special role for observers. By associating perspectives with commutative observables rather than entire quantum systems, several previous problems with the interpretation are dissolved. As a side result, we show how a quantum measurement, properly described, is a continuous process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</a><span class="id">[2601.03567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</p></div></details></article>

Since most prior studies on student sensemaking in physics have focused on introductory physics, this study sheds light on a relatively unexplored research area involving the sensemaking of advanced physics students. We conducted individual interviews with graduate students to investigate their sensemaking while solving upper-level undergraduate electrostatics problems in the context of the method of images. Analysis through the lens of the epistemic game framework proposed by Tuminaro and Redish shows that the central part of student sensemaking can be mapped on to the Pictorial Analysis game with other epistemic games also playing a role, but the ontological components of some games require refinement. The study involves an in-depth comparison of sensemaking on related but distinct problems for individual graduate students and comparison between multiple students solving the same problems. It provides insights into how graduate students transfer and translate strategies between different problems while sensemaking. Graduate students showed persistence in activating different knowledge resources and consistent use of reasoning primitives across different problems sensemaking. The study investigated the impact of small nudging and scaffolding that resulted in significant improvements in the problem-solving approaches of graduate students. Another novel finding is that problem-solving approaches of graduate students significantly improved with successive attempts and multiple drawings for the same problem and across problems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relating visual attention and learning in an online instructional physics module</a><span class="id">[2602.08247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Learning using Computer-Assisted Instruction (CAI) demands a high level of attention given the tendency to be distracted and mind-wander. How does the online STEM instructor know when learners are having attentional problems and the extent to which these problems affect learning? In the present study, the visual attentional and cognitive state of physics graduate students were probed while they went through a multimedia instructional module to refresh their knowledge of Newton's II Law. Data from an eye tracker, webcam, egocentric glasses, screen recording, and mouse and keyboard events were integrated to record learners' attention overt attention to the learning environment (+/-) and thinking about learning content (+/-) to analyze students' attention spans during learning from this module. On average, learners were found to be on-task and on-screen for a vast majority of time, with evidence of mind wandering. The learning module improved the participants efficiency with which they answered the questions correctly on a post-test relative to the pre-test. Further, there is a positive albeit statistically non-significant correlation between the improvement from pre- to post-test efficiency and the time spent on-screen and on-task during the module.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-based Verbal and Visual Scaffolding in a Serious Game: Effects on Learning and Cognitive Load</a><span class="id">[2602.08893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Due to their interactive nature, serious games offer valuable opportunities for supporting learning in educational contexts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have further opened the door to new forms of personalized scaffolding in education. In this study, we combine both worlds and study three types of AI-based scaffolding designs in a serious game: (i) no scaffolding, (ii) chat-based (verbal) scaffolding provided by an AI-based non-player character (NPC), and (iii) combined chat-(verbal) and action-based (visual) scaffolding in which the AI may both try to explain or demonstrate the next step towards a solution. The scaffolding conditions are embedded in Qookies, a serious game designed to introduce fundamental concepts of quantum technologies. A total of 152 school students, university students, and members of the general public were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The results show that all groups experience significant learning gains, confirming the overall effectiveness of the serious game itself. No significant differences in learning outcomes emerged between scaffolding conditions. However, intrinsic cognitive load was lower in the combined chat-and-action (verbal+visual) scaffolding condition compared to the chat (verbal)-only condition, suggesting that visual demonstrations may offer more accessible support. Interaction analyses further revealed that players engaged with the AI character primarily for level-related questions and action recommendations, while deeper interactions were relatively rare.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDIO-CT collaborative strategy for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation: an illustration of solving the period of mathematical pendulum</a><span class="id">[2212.09209]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The problem-project-oriented STEM education plays a significant role in training students' ability of innovation. Although the conceive-design-implement-operate (CDIO) approach and the computational thinking (CT) are hot topics in recent decade, there are still two deficiencies: the CDIO approach and CT are discussed separately and a general framework of coping with complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation is missing. In this paper, a collaborative strategy based on the CDIO and CT is proposed for solving complex STEM problems in system modeling and simulation with a general framework, in which the CDIO is about “how to do&quot;, CT is about “how to think&quot;, and the project means “what to do&quot;. As an illustration, the problem of solving the period of mathematical pendulum (MP) is discussed in detail. The most challenging task involved in the problem is to compute the complete elliptic integral of the first kind (CEI-1). In the philosophy of STEM education, all problems have more than one solutions. For computing the CEI-1, four methods are discussed with a top-down strategy, which includes the infinite series method, arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) method, Gauss-Chebyshev method and Gauss-Legendre method. The algorithms involved can be utilized for R &amp; D projects of interest and be reused according to the requirements encountered. The general framework for solving complex STEM problem in system modeling and simulation is worth recommending to the college students and instructors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thematic analysis of student perceptions of resources and demands experienced in introductory physics</a><span class="id">[2502.14692]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current work aims to better understand student course experiences for those who reported negative perceptions in introductory physics. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 students who reported negative perceptions of their class on a screening survey. Participants were asked to share general reflections on challenges and successes they experienced, as well as their reflections on specific aspects of the course (e.g., experiences with instructors and peers). Interview transcripts were then coded to identify the types of experiences students reported, whether they were experienced as positive or negative, as well as the themes and features associated with those experiences. Experiences with the classroom, course structure, instructors, and exams were most frequently reported as negative. Experiences with peers, help-seeking, course curriculum, and specific learning activities were the most positive, though only experiences with peers had more positive reports than negative. We then used a resources vs. demands framework [Soc Personal Psychol Compass 7, 637 (2013)] to interpret the common instructional, cognitive, and motivational themes and features reported across multiple contexts. We discuss the implications of the results for theory and practice.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solving Linear Systems of Equations with the Quantum HHL Algorithm: A Tutorial on the Physical and Mathematical Foundations for Undergraduate Students</a><span class="id">[2509.16640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum computing enables the efficient resolution of complex problems, often outperforming classical methods across various applications. In 2009, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd proposed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, demonstrating exponential speedup (under ideal conditions) with a complexity of $poly(\log N)$, in contrast to classical approaches, which in the general case exhibit a complexity of $O(N^3)$, although they can achieve $O(N)$ in specific cases involving sparse matrices. This algorithm holds promise for advancements in machine learning, the solution of differential equations, linear regression, and cryptographic analysis. However, its structure is intricate, and there is a notable lack of detailed instructional materials in the literature. In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.</p></div></details></article>

This paper proposes a roadmap to quantum aesthetics that examines how quantum concepts become aesthetic phenomena through artistic mediation rather than direct representation. Two complementary and orthogonal approaches are articulated. The first, a pioneering top-down approach, employs text-prompt-based generative AI to probe quantum aesthetics as a collective cultural construct embedded in large-scale training data. By systematically modulating the linguistic weight of the term &quot;quantum,&quot; generative models are used as experimental environments to reveal how quantum imaginaries circulate within contemporary visual culture. The second, a bottom-up approach, derives aesthetic form directly from quantum-mechanical structures through the visualization of quantum-generated data, exemplified here by hydrogen atomic orbitals calculated from the Schrödinger equation. These approaches are framed not as competing methods but as intersecting paths within a navigable field of artistic research. They position quantum aesthetics as an emergent field of artistic research shaped by cultural imagination, computational mediation, and physical law, opening new directions for artistic practice and pedagogy at the intersection of art, data, artificial intelligence and quantum science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imagining the Alien: Human Projections and Cognitive Limitations</a><span class="id">[2602.07284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Imagining what life on other planets, and intelligent life in particular, may be like is a long-running theme in human culture. It is a manifestation of the innate human curiosity about the Cosmos, and it has inspired numerous works of art and folklore, including whole literary and other media genres. It is a profound question, with philosophical and existential implications. There is also an obvious connection with religious beliefs, as gods and other superhuman beings were imagined in the heavens. Speculations about alien beings grew in time, and today, it is a scientific subject of astrobiology, and it is pursued through serious searches for life and intelligence in the universe. However, almost all imaginings of the alien map terrestrial life forms and human cultural, historical, and psychological phenomena to the putative aliens. This lack of individual and collective imagination may reflect our biological and cultural evolution, as our minds are formed through our experiences, perceptions of the world, and interactions with our terrestrial and human environments. As such, imagining aliens is mainly a cultural phenomenon and may reflect the intrinsic cognitive limitations of the human mind. Interestingly, we did create what is effectively an alien intelligence on this planet in the form of now rapidly evolving Artificial Intelligence (AI). As its capabilities grow, it may give us new insights into what extraterrestrial advanced intelligences may be like.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Great Filter hypothesis – a new Great Filter?</a><span class="id">[2602.08188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Great Filter hypothesis is an extension of the Fermi Paradox: &quot;If life is so common in the universe, why don't we see it?&quot; The Great Filter theory posits there are multiple obstacles or filters life must pass through which ultimately sifts out intelligent life. This paper identifies a new filter: depopulation. As an exospecies advances and reaches the top of the food chain on its planet, Darwinian evolution selects the species to breed fewer offspring due to a lack of predation. As the species evolves intelligence, this leads to medicines and most notably contraception, enabling the species to reduce infant mortality while controlling reproduction. Finally, economic, social and educational factors add to the conscious decision of the intelligent life to slow reproduction. These factors are currently contributing to a human global population peak mid century with subsequent population collapse in less than 500 years. Noting that population growth and decline is exponential, our modelling forecasts human extinction thresholds being tested sometime after the year 2500. There is no reason to assume depopulation dynamics (exodepopulation) would not apply to exocivilizations (exodemography), thus providing a possible resolution of the Fermi Paradox. Furthermore, as machines and AI inevitably supplement humans as depopulation accelerates, the Fermi Paradox can be restated as &quot;Why don't we see machines and AI colonising the galaxy?&quot; A plausible answer is machines will not become conscious and will continue to operate only as tools, tools that will cease operating once humanity is extinct. The Fermi Paradox can then be restated as &quot;Machines will not become conscious, otherwise we would see them colonising the galaxy&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooperative Sovereignty on Mars: Lessons from the International Telecommunication Union and Universal Postal Union</a><span class="id">[2602.08853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As humans make ambitious efforts toward long-duration activities beyond Earth, new challenges will continue to emerge that highlight the need for governance frameworks capable of managing shared resources and technical standards in order to sustain human life in these hostile environments. Earth-based governance models of cooperative sovereignty can inform governance mechanisms for future Mars settlements, particularly regarding inter-settlement relations and the technical coordination required for multiple independent settlements to coexist. This study analyzes the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the Universal Postal Union (UPU), two of the oldest international organizations, which have successfully established evolving standards across sovereign nations. This analysis of the development and governance structures of these two organizations, and how they resolved key sovereignty issues, reveals principles that could be applicable to future settlements beyond Earth, particularly on Mars. Key insights include the strategic necessity of institutional neutrality, the management of asymmetric power relations, and the governance of shared resources under conditions of mutual vulnerability. The study distinguishes between a &quot;Survival Layer&quot; of technical standards essential for immediate safety and an &quot;Operational Layer&quot; governing economic and political activities, suggesting different governance approaches for each. Although some of these examples of cooperative sovereignty on Earth might not be sufficient for Mars due to its unique environment, lessons from the ITU and UPU case studies offer valuable strategies for designing flexible and sustainable governance models that can function from inception through explicit Earth-based coordination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI-based Verbal and Visual Scaffolding in a Serious Game: Effects on Learning and Cognitive Load</a><span class="id">[2602.08893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Due to their interactive nature, serious games offer valuable opportunities for supporting learning in educational contexts.
