<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scale Invariance, Variety and Central Configurations</a><span class="id">[2602.11225]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scale invariance has received very little attention in physics. Nevertheless, it provides a natural conceptual foundation for a relational understanding of the universe, where absolute size loses meaning and only dimensionless ratios retain physical significance. We formalize this idea through the $N$-body problem, introducing a scale-invariant function–the variety, $V$–built from the square root of the center-of-mass moment of inertia and the Newtonian potential. Critical points of $V$, known as central configurations, correspond to special particle arrangements that preserve their shape under homothetic collapse or expansion. Numerical exploration of these critical points reveals that even slight deviations from the absolute minimum of $V$, which corresponds to a remarkably uniform configuration, lead to the spontaneous formation of filaments, loops, voids and other patterns reminiscent of the cosmic web. This behavior is a consequence of the intrinsic structure of shape space–the space of configurations modulo translations, rotations and dilatations–in which regions of higher variety act as attractors. Our results suggest that scale-invariant dynamics not only captures the relational nature of physical laws but also naturally generates organized patterns, offering a novel perspective on the formation of cosmic structures and on the emergence of a gravitational arrow of time from scale-invariant, relational dynamics.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spreading viscous fluids on a horizontal surface: project-based learning in fluid mechanics</a><span class="id">[2602.12140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spreading of a thin viscous fluid film on a horizontal surface is an interesting problem in fluid mechanics with many practical applications ranging from coating processes to biological systems and environmental flows. It can even be observed in everyday situations, such as syrup spreading on a pancake. We present a project-based learning approach to this problem, in which engineering or physics undergraduates apply classroom knowledge to understand and solve it, using dimensional analysis, experiments, and theoretical modeling. First, a dimensional analysis is conducted to guide the design of the experiment suitable for an undergraduate laboratory or even at home. The problem is then simplified to obtain a mathematical model that accounts for the experimental results. Through this process, students are able to obtain a solution compatible with those published in fluid mechanics journals with minimal supervision from the instructor. This project not only develops important skills but also motivates students by showing that they have the ability to solve complex problems.</p></div></details></article></body>
