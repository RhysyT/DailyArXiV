X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T_c \simeq 6\times10^8~\mathrm{K}$. This supports the pure-deflagration progenitor scenario for Type Iax SN 1181, which implies the presence of a He star companion inside Pa 30; we also discuss why such a potential He star has not been detected and its prospects for discovery by future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Obliquities of Young Systems, Atmospheres Undergoing Contraction and Escape (SOYSAUCE): a likely aligned orbit for the 3 Myr planet TIDYE-1 b</a><span class="id">[2511.14838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite the wide range of planet-star (mis)alignments in the mature population of transiting exoplanets, the small number of known young transiting planets are nearly all aligned with the rotation axes of their host stars, as determined by the sky-projected obliquity angle. The small number of young systems with measured obliquities limits statistical conclusions. Here we determine the sky-projected obliquity ($\lambda$) of the 3 Myr transiting planet with a misaligned outer protoplanetary disk, TIDYE-1 b (IRAS 04125+2902 b), using the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect. Our dataset lacks a pre-transit baseline and ingress, complicating a blind RM fit. Instead, we use contemporaneous spectra and photometry from a mass-measurement campaign to model the stellar activity trend across the transit and provide an external prior on the velocity baseline. We determine $|\lambda|=11.8^{+5.9\,\circ}_{-5.0}$. Combined with the published rotational velocity of the star, we find a true three-dimensional obliquity of $\psi=15.2^{+7.3\,\circ}_{-5.7}$. Our result is consistent with an aligned orbit, suggesting the planet remains aligned to its star even though the outer disk is misaligned, though additional RM observations are needed to exclude the low-probability tail of misaligned ($&gt;30^{\circ}$) scenarios present in our posterior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio properties of the quasi-periodic eruption source RXJ1301.9+2747 at parsec scales</a><span class="id">[2511.14863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are repeating soft X-ray flares associated with galactic nuclei. Several recent works have found evidence that the accretion flow in the galactic nuclei of QPEs is of recent origin, and that it is unlike canonical active galactic nuclei (AGN). A precursor tidal disruption event has been observed in a few cases. In this work we report new radio observations of the QPE host galaxy RXJ 1301.9+2747 taken at 5.0 GHz with the High Sensitivity Array (HSA), to complement archival 1.7 GHz observations reported previously. Our new observations confirm the presence of a highly compact radio source in RXJ 1301.9+2747, which is smaller than $0.9\times0.4~\mathrm{pc}$ at 5.0 GHz. The nonsimultaneous very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) compact flux of the source is consistent with a negative spectral index, and thus is similar to the larger non-VLBI scale radio spectral index. Contrary to earlier results at 1.7 GHz, we find the 5 GHz emission offset from the optical Gaia position, which may be due to dust extinction in the host galaxy. In addition, there is a significant offset between the 1.7 and 5.0 GHz data, which may result from astrophysical uncertainties in the calibration source. This sheds new light on the elusive properties of the radio-detected QPE sources. Consistent with previous results, our observations disfavor a star formation or jet-core-region origin of the radio emission. We cannot rule out a reconnection-driven scenario for the radio emission, but we favor a remnant jet or outflow scenario. This is overall in agreement with the radio properties of radio-detected QPE sources at lower angular resolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2023taz: Implications for the UV Diversity of Superluminous Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.14916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are some of the brightest explosions in the Universe representing the extremes of stellar deaths. At the upper end of their distribution is SN 2023taz, one of the most luminous SLSNe discovered to date with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_{g,\rm{peak}}=-22.75 \pm 0.03$ and a lower limit for energy radiated of $E=2.9 \times 10^{51}$ erg. Magnetar model fits reveal individual parameter values typical of the SLSN population, but the combination of a low $B$-field and ejecta mass with a short spin period places SN 2023taz in a unusual region of parameter space, accounting for its extreme luminosity. The optical data around peak are consistent with a temperature of $\sim$17 000 K but SN 2023taz shows a surprising deficit in the UV compared to other events in this temperature range. We find no indication of dust extinction that could plausibly explain the UV deficit. The lower level of UV flux is reminiscent of the absorption seen in lower-luminosity events like SN 2017dwh, where Fe-group elements are responsible for the effect. However, in the case of SN 2023taz, there is no evidence for a larger amount of Fe-group elements which could contribute to line blanketing. Comparing to SLSNe with well-observed UV spectra, an underlying temperature of $8000-9000$ K would match the UV spectral slope, but is not consistent with the optical colour temperatures of these events. The most likely explanation is enhanced absorption by intermediate-mass elements, challenging previous findings that SLSNe exhibit similar UV absorption line equivalent widths. This highlights the need for expanded UV spectroscopic coverage of SLSNe, especially at early times, to build a framework for interpreting their diversity and to enable classification at higher redshifts where optical observations will exclusively probe rest-frame UV emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of a Conducting Sphere Moving through Magnetized Plasma: Alfvén Wings, Slow Magnetosonic Wings, and Drag Force</a><span class="id">[2511.14932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Plasma-mediated interaction between astrophysical objects can play an important role and produce electromagnetic radiation in various binary systems, ranging from planet-moon and star-planet systems to binary compact objects. We perform 3D magnetohydrodynamic numerical simulations to study an ideal magnetized plasma flowing past an unmagnetized conducting sphere. Such flow generates magnetic disturbances and produces a drag force on the sphere, and we explore the corresponding drag coefficient as a function of the flow speed relative to Alfvén speed and the $\beta$ parameter of the background plasma. We find that the drag is generally well-described by the Alfvén wing model, but we also show that slow magnetosonic waves provide a correction through their own wing-like features. These give rise to a nontrivial dependence of the drag coefficient on the plasma $\beta$, as well as enhanced drag as the flow speed approaches the Alfvén speed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton specific entropy as a proxy for the $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ charge state ratio over heliocentric distance</a><span class="id">[2511.14938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the fast solar wind has well-established origins in coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind remains uncertain. Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below  1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Jet Energetics of the Transient X-ray Binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070 through Calorimetry</a><span class="id">[2511.14941]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations aimed at identifying potential jet-ISM interaction sites in the vicinity of the transient black hole X-ray binaries MAXI J1348-630 and MAXI J1820+070, both of which have recently undergone an outburst, and displayed powerful large scale jets. Using this dataset, we construct molecular line emission maps. By analyzing the morphological, spectral, and kinematic properties of the detected emission, we identify a molecular structure that provides compelling evidence for a jet-driven cavity in the local environment of MAXI J1348-630 but find no significant emission in the local environment of MAXI J1820+070. We use the properties of the detected molecular emission surrounding MAXI J1348-630 to constrain the jet power, finding our results to be consistent with other independent studies of this source, and further validating the utility of astrochemistry for constraining jet energetics. Additionally, our findings provide the first assessment on the formation timescales for jet-ISM interaction regions in the transient black hole X-ray binary population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relative Strengths of Fundamental and Harmonic Emissions of Solar Radio Type II Bursts</a><span class="id">[2511.15011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar radio type II bursts are slow-drifting bursts that exhibit various distinct features such as Fundamental (F) and Harmonic (H) emissions, band-splitting, and discrete fine structures in the dynamic spectra. Observationally, it has been found that in some cases the F emission is stronger than the H emission, and vice versa. The reason for such behavior has not been thoroughly investigated. To investigate this, we studied 58 meter wave (20-500 MHz) type II solar radio bursts showing both F and H emissions, observed during the period from 13 June 2010 to 25 December 2024, using data obtained with the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (CALLISTO) spectrometers at different locations and Gauribidanur LOw-frequency Solar Spectrograph (GLOSS). We examined the intensity ratios of the H ($I_H$) and F ($I_F$) emissions and analyzed their variation with heliographic longitude. We found that 14 out of 19 bursts originating from heliographic longitudes beyond $\pm75^\circ$ exhibited an $I_H/I_F$ ratio greater than unity. In contrast, 32 out of 39 bursts originating from longitudes within $\pm75^\circ$ showed a intensity ratio less than unity. From these results, we conclude that the relative strength of the F and H emissions can be influenced by refraction due to density gradient in the solar corona, directivity and viewing angle of the bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyperaccretion-driven relativistic jets from massive collapsars in active galactic nucleus disks</a><span class="id">[2511.15056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observable characteristics of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) embedded in the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are mainly determined by the jet propagation within the disk. In the massive collapsar scenario, we consider that the mass and metallicity of progenitor stars can significantly affect the jet durations and luminosities, which in turn influence whether the jet can break out from AGN disks. For the cases with low metallicity, massive stars tend to keep their massive envelopes. Thus the hyperaccretion of these envelopes onto the newborn black holes (BHs) can prolong the activity duration of the central engine, thereby allowing the jets to potentially break out from the disks. For successful jets, we further study their prompt emission and afterglows for different supermassive BHs and locations and discuss the detectability of these signals by instruments such as \emph{Swift} and Einstein Probe. Future related observations will help constrain the structure, components, and evolutionary history of AGN disks and the massive stars embedded within them.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep-learning mitigation of foregrounds and beam effects in 21-cm intensity mapping using hybrid frequency differencing and PCA</a><span class="id">[2511.15072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>21-cm intensity mapping (IM) is a powerful technique to probe the large-scale distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) and extract cosmological information such as the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. A key challenge lies in recovering the faint HI signal from bright foregrounds and frequency-dependent beam effects, which can compromise traditional cleaning methods like principal component analysis (PCA) by removing part of the cosmological signal. Deep-learning approaches have recently been proposed to mitigate these effects by learning mappings between contaminated and true cosmological signals. Building upon our previous work \citep{2024PhRvD.109f3509S} on the frequency-differencing (FD) method, this study extends the framework to systematically compare FD-based and PCA-based UNet reconstructions using realistic simulations that include foregrounds and beam convolution. We find that both approaches perform comparably without beam or with a Gaussian beam, but under a realistic cosine beam they systematically underestimate the large-scale cross-correlation power spectrum, particularly for $k&lt;0.1 h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. To address this limitation, we explore a hybrid approach in which the UNet is trained with two input channels, one constructed from FD and the other from PCA cleaning, allowing the network to simultaneously exploit the strengths of both inputs. This two-channel strategy achieves superior performance, maintaining the cross-correlation power spectrum close to unity on large scales under a cosine beam, improving by 5-8% relative to either FD-based or PCA-based UNet alone. These results demonstrate that providing complementary FD and PCA information to a single deep network is an effective route to robust HI reconstruction, laying the groundwork for precision BAO measurements with future low-redshift 21 cm IM surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications of the Two-Component Dark Energy Model for Hubble Tension</a><span class="id">[2511.15087]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark energy plays a crucial role in the evolution of cosmic expansion. In most studies, dark energy is considered a single dynamic component. In fact, multi-component dark energy models may theoretically explain the accelerated expansion of the universe as well. In our previous research, we constructed the $w_{\rm{n}}$CDM ($n=2, 3, 5$) models and conducted numerical research, finding strong observational support when the value of n is small. Based on our results, both the $\chi^2$ and Akaike information criterion (AIC) favor the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model more than the $w_0w_{\rm{a}}$CDM model. However, previous studies were limited to two equal-component dark energy models, failing to consider the component proportions as variables. Therefore, we will further explore the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model. To simplify the model, we fix $w = -1$ in one component and set the other component to $w_{\rm{de2}}$, varying the proportions of both components in the population. Under different $w_{\rm{de2}}$, we obtain the one-dimensional distribution of ${H}_{0}$ with respect to $f_{\rm{de2}}$. Further fitting reveals the evolution of ${H}_{0}$ under varying $w_{\rm{de2}}$ and $f_{\rm{de2}}$. We also perform the same operation on $\chi^2$. To evaluate the error of fitting, we introduce two indicators, $\text{R}^{2}_{\text{adj}}$ and MAPE, to quantify the fitting ability of our models. We find that when $w_{\rm{de2}}$ is less than -1, ${H}_{0}$ increases with the decrease of $w_{\rm{de2}}$ and the increase of $f_{\rm{de2}}$, effectively alleviating ${H}_{0}$ tension. For $\chi^2$, it still prefers the $\Lambda$CDM model, and the $w_{\rm{2}}$CDM model will decrease significantly when it approaches the $\Lambda$CDM model. The excellent performance of $\text{R}^{2}_{\text{adj}}$ and MAPE further proves that our model has an outstanding fitting effect and extremely high reliability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale for 105 UTMOST pulsars with a Kalman filter</a><span class="id">[2511.15134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Crust-superfluid coupling plays an important role in neutron star rotation, particularly with respect to timing noise and glitches. Here, we present new timing-noise-based estimates of the crust-superfluid coupling time-scale \(\tau\) for 105 radio pulsars in the UTMOST dataset, by Kalman filtering the pulse times of arrival. The 105 objects are selected because they favor a two-component, crust-superfluid model over a one-component model with log Bayes factor \(\ln \mathfrak{B}_{\rm BF} \geq 5\). The median estimate of \(\tau\) ranges from \(10^{4.6\pm0.4}\) s for PSR J2241$-$5236 to \(10^{7.7^{+0.7}_{-0.4}}\) s for PSR J1644$-$4559 among 28 out of 105 objects with sharply peaked \(\tau\) posteriors. A hierarchical Bayesian analysis is performed on 101 out of 105 objects that are canonical (i.e.\ neither recycled nor magnetars) and reside in the populous core of the \(\Omega_{\rm c}\)-\(\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}\) plane. It returns the population-level scaling \(\tau \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{0.19^{+0.50}_{-0.52}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{0.18^{+0.18}_{-0.19}}\), where \(\Omega_{\rm c}\) and \(\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}\) are the angular velocity and spin-down rate of the crust respectively. The variances of the stochastic crust and superfluid torques are also estimated hierarchically, with \(Q_{\rm c} \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{1.23^{+0.80}_{-0.75}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{0.49^{+0.27}_{-0.32}}\) and \(Q_{\rm s} \propto \Omega_{\rm c}^{0.71^{+0.76}_{-0.78}} |\dot{\Omega}_{\rm c}|^{1.27^{+0.30}_{-0.28}}\) respectively. Implications for the physical origin of crust-superfluid coupling, e.g.\ through mutual friction, are discussed briefly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission as the Driving Mechanism in Long-Period Radio Transients</a><span class="id">[2511.15154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period radio transients (LPRTs) are highly polarised, coherent radio sources with periods of minutes to hours and bursts typically lasting 10-100s. We argue that electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) explains their narrow duty cycles and polarisation properties. In this picture, a rotating oblique magnetosphere beams radiation into a thin, hollow emission cone whose surface lies almost perpendicularly to the local magnetic field. The observed very narrow pulses arise when the line of sight skims the cone. Broader profiles and weak leading or trailing components occur when multiple azimuths along the emission ring satisfy the maser resonance condition. The observed isotropic-equivalent luminosities of  10^{30}-10^{31} erg s^{-1} correspond to modest intrinsic powers once strong ECME beaming is taken into account, which is readily achievable through accretion from the interstellar medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15158" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-thermal processes in standard big bang nucleosynthesis: III. Reactions with slow nuclei and the overall effect</a><span class="id">[2511.15158]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The present paper completes a series of our works on non-thermal nuclear processes in big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) started in JCAP05(2008)010 (Part I) and 05(2009)001 (Part II). The processes are triggered by non-Maxwellian particles naturally born in the main BBN reactions. Half of these reactions generate fast particles k^+ (= n,p,t,3He,alpha). The other half, being radiative capture processes, produce slow nuclei k^- (= d,t,3He,7Li,7Be) which can undergo (k^-,n) reactions with neutrons having large cross sections. The particle production rate R_k, thermalization time tau_k, and effective number density n_k are determined. It is shown that the values of n_k at the Universe temperatures T &gt; 65 keV can exceed the number densities of Maxwellian 7Li and 7Be ions. To clarify the overall non-Maxwellian effect on BBN, both types of the non-Maxwellian particles are taken into account in the reaction network. Particular attention is paid to two-step sequential processes like p(n,gamma)d^-(n,gamma)t, d(p,gamma)3He^-(n,p)t, t(alpha,gamma)7Li^-(n,gamma)8Li, 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be^-(n,p)7Li, d(t,alpha)n^+(A,n)a_1a_2, and d(3He,alpha)p^+(A,p)a_1a_2 with (A,a_1,a_2) = 7Li,t,alpha) and (7Be,3He,alpha. It is obtained that the non-Maxwellian particles can selectively affect the element abundances, e.g., improve the prediction on 7Li/H by  1.5% and at the same time leave unchanged the 4He abundance. The main conclusion however is that these particles are unable to significantly change the standard picture of BBN in general, and provide a pathway toward a solution of the cosmological lithium problem in particular.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refractive indices of photochemical haze analogs for Solar System and exoplanet applications : a cross-laboratory comparative study between the PAMPRE and COSmIC experimental set-ups</a><span class="id">[2511.15310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Previous observations of Titan, Pluto and Solar System gas giants along with recent observations of exoplanet atmospheres with the James Webb Space Telescope taught us that photochemical hazes are ubiquitous and form in a variety of temperature, gas composition and irradiation environments.

A Search for Exomoons</a><span class="id">[2511.15317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a search for exomoons around the Jupiter-like exoplanet Kepler-167e using a NIRSpec JWST transit. Our 60 hour time series clearly reveals the enormous impact of long-term trends in NIRSpec data, specifically a gradual flux drift occurring over each of six 10 hour exposures. We weighed the evidence for exomoons by comparing a planet-only model with a planet+moon model for a grid of twelve different analysis choices. Our grid was comprised of three different reduction pipelines and four different models for the exposure-long trends - two using linear models and two using Gaussian processes. Seven grid realizations indicate a strong exomoon detection, typically favoring a Roche-skimming orbit roughly 10% the size of the planet. We find that the only likely real astrophysical feature driving these fits is a syzygy-like event occurring almost exactly mid-transit, which is highly ambiguous with a spot-crossing event. Indeed, we show that a spot of the necessary size is compatible with the earlier Kepler data. Ironically, the fact that JWST is so superior to Kepler means that our fits are effectively driven by a single transit - a regime in which exomoons have enormous freedom to explain non-Gaussian behavior. We thus strongly urge the next transit be observed in October 2027 to break these degeneracies. Our pilot study to seek transiting exomoons with JWST reveals the profound impact exposure-long trends exert - a cautionary tale for future analyzes of this data - as well as the need for a deeper understanding of this systematic's cause and modeling best-practices.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.15325]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Milgromian Dynamics (MOND) has been particularly successful in predicting scaling relations for galactic systems, namely the baryonic Tully-Fisher for spirals, the Faber-Jackson for ellipticals and the Radial Acceleration Relation for late-type galaxies. Its essential tenet is the modification of the gravity law at low accelerations. Nevertheless, despite MOND's passed tests, the puzzle of the missing mass on galaxy clusters' scales still persists. One proposed scenario to complete this deficit and apply it further to cosmology is the so-called $\nu$HDM model. It is composed of a sterile neutrino and the MOND gravity. In this Ph.D. thesis, I have put forward this cosmological idea, conducting hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the $\nu$HDM structure formation. In the debut attempt, the $\nu$HDM model was proven capable of reproducing the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, imitating the same expansion history ($\Omega_m \approx$ 0.3 and $H_0 \approx$ 67.6 km/s/Mpc), reproducing the CMB phenomenology, while the cosmic web is nicely formed. In the next step, I have optimized the $\nu$HDM model using Bayesian statistics, re-branding it to opt-$\nu$HDM. I managed to optimally fit the angular power spectrum of the CMB calculated by \textit{Planck}, except its fourth peak, but the opt-$\nu$HDM cosmological parameters changed significantly with respect to its precursor, resulting in a much heavier cosmos, with $\Omega_m \approx$ 0.5 and $H_0 \approx$ 55.6 km/s/Mpc. Next, I explore the opt-$\nu$HDM expansion history, its structure formation and the resulting mass function. The appearance of the early-time structures, firstly in the $\nu$HDM model, as well as in the opt-$\nu$HDM model occurs quiet late, at $z\approx4$ and at $z\approx 5.5$, respectively. Although the resolution has improved from previous studies, the $\nu$HDM variants cannot explain easily the high-redshift galaxies, observed by JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interacting binaries on the Main Sequence as in-situ tracers of mass transfer efficiency and stability</a><span class="id">[2511.15347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the transfer of mass and angular momentum in binary interactions is crucial for modelling the evolution of any interacting binary after the first mass transfer phase. We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the present-day mass of the donor star represents its initial convective core mass at Zero-Age Main Sequence, we estimate its initial mass using detailed stellar evolution models. From the initial donor mass, we calculate the range of initial accretor masses (for different mass transfer efficiencies). By imposing physical constraints on the above initial parameter ranges, we derive the mass transfer efficiency, stability and angular momentum loss that can reproduce the current properties of each Algol binary. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\sim$28 \% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\lesssim$ 50 \%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\%. The current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods (2 d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\sim 0.6$. The massive Algols in the SMC seem to have undergone less efficient mass transfer than those in the LMC and Milky Way.

Using the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2, we identify galaxy multiplets as discrete objects and measure their cross-correlations with the general galaxy field. Our results show that the multiplets exhibit stronger clustering bias as they trace more massive dark matter halos than individual galaxies. When comparing the observed clustering statistics with the mock catalogs generated from the N-body simulation AbacusSummit, we find that the mocks underpredict multiplet clustering despite reproducing the galaxy two-point auto-correlation reasonably well. This discrepancy indicates that the standard Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model is insufficient to describe the properties of galaxy multiplets, revealing the greater constraining power of this higher-order statistic on galaxy-halo connection and the possibility that multiplets are specific to additional assembly bias. We demonstrate that incorporating secondary biases into the HOD model improves agreement with the observed multiplet statistics, specifically by allowing galaxies to preferentially occupy halos in denser environments. Our results highlight the potential of utilizing multiplet clustering, beyond traditional two-point correlation measurements, to break degeneracies in models describing the galaxy-dark matter connection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viscous Dark Energy and Mass-Varying Dark Matter in Lyra Manifold: Cosmological Dynamics and Observational Constraints</a><span class="id">[2511.15422]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a universe described by Lyra's geometry in the presence of dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM).

In this work, we focus on the imprint of non-cold dark matter (DM), which impacts the formation of the smallest halos. Our goal in particular is to clarify whether near-future radio telescopes such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionisation Array (HERA), will be able to distinguish between free-streaming dark matter, specifically in the form of thermal warm DM (WDM), and collisional damping due to neutrino-DM ($\nu$DM) interactions giving rise to larger overdensities on small scales. For that purpose we first implement a mapping between the two models in terms of a cutoff scale and determine detection thresholds for the two DM models. Using Fisher matrix forecasts, we show that $\nu$DM interaction strengths down to $\sigma_{\nu{\rm DM}}\sim 3\times10^{-35}$ cm$^2$ could be probed by $21\,$cm cosmology when considering two populations of galaxies for a GeV mass DM. This would allow to either confirm or rule out a recent claimed preference for a non-zero $\nu$DM interaction in Lyman-$\alpha$ data. Furthermore, we find that HERA will not be able to distinguish between $\nu$DM and WDM. In the latter context, the threshold for detection of $\nu$DM interactions translates into WDM with mass up to $m_{\rm WDM}\sim 9$ keV that could be detected by HERA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advancing Identification method of Gamma-Ray Bursts with Data and Feature Enhancement</a><span class="id">[2511.15470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are challenging to identify due to their transient nature, complex temporal profiles, and limited observational datasets.

These scenarios appear alternative dark energy parameterizations with respect to the well-known $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model, claimed as the most viable model by DESI. Accordingly, we perform Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) analyses with the publicly available \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code, including the three Padé cosmology, along with the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM and $\Lambda$CDM standard pictures. To this end, we combine independent probes from high to low redshifts to obtain reliable constraints on the cosmological parameters of these models and compare them using statistical selection criteria. \emph{Our results show that Padé cosmology is neither statistically excluded nor worse than the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM parametrization}.

Even though PDS at L1 have been extensively studied both through statistical and event analysis, their investigation at distances closer to the Sun is limited. This study performs a statistical investigation of PDS at various distances from the Sun between 0.3 and 1 AU by exploiting Solar Orbiter data. We compiled and made publicly available an extensive list of PDSs following a well-established methodology that combines the Multitaper method as well as wavelet analysis to reveal the distribution of PDS radial length scales and how they vary with respect to the radial distance. Our results indicate that PDS advected with the ambient slow solar wind are expanded at a rate of approximately 10%, while PDS detected during fast solar wind segments show compression at a similar rate. These are consistent with the scenario in which PDSs are formed at the Sun by processes involving magnetic reconnection and interchange reconnection in the solar corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is There New Physics Beyond 30 TeV in the BOAT?</a><span class="id">[2511.15542]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the GRB 221009A spectrum detected by LHAASO can be used to probe effects of quadratic subluminal Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) through the enhancement of the observed flux at the highest energies.

Our systematic echelle spectroscopy, secured since September 2021, led to the discovery that the optical spectra are dominated by spectral lines of three early-type stars, two moving around each other on a 8.234 d orbit of a high eccentricity, which causes periodic brightenings near the periastron passage, and the third one (component Ba) being the brighter component of the 5.853 d binary. Both pairs are physically bounded and revolve around each other with a period somewhere between 1600 and 2200 days (4.4 to 6 years). The object exhibits small cyclic light variations of a variable amplitude and characteristic time scale of 0.071 d (14.14 c d-1), seen throughout the whole orbit.

This non-detection may stem from limited sensitivity and source localization of current $\gamma$-ray instruments, as well as strong interactions of $\gamma$-rays with intervening material that restrict detectable signals to only a few nearby and dynamically active clusters. Motivated by these constraints, we selected a sample of nearby ($z&lt;0.05$) merging clusters and analyzed 14 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. In this work, we present a detailed study of Abell 119 (A119), a merging cluster with significant X-ray luminosity and complex dynamics. Using \textit{Fermipy} and \textit{Fermi} Science Tools, we modeled all potential $\gamma$-ray sources and confirmed the 4FGL point sources 4FGL J0059.3$-$0152, 4FGL J0101.0$-$0059, and 4FGL J0059.2+0006 with significant TS values.s. It further reveals, a $\sim4\sigma$ excess of diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission offset by $\sim0.25^\circ$ from the cluster center, plausibly associated with the cluster halo. An extended model provides the best fit, yielding luminosity bounds of $\sim 12.21^{+2.74}_{-3.95}\times10^{42}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ and a particle spectral index of $\sim2.25^{+0.38}_{-0.13}$, consistent with earlier expectations for cluster-scale non-thermal emission. These results suggest a hadronic origin for the detected signal. Although the $\sim4\sigma$ excess is compelling, uncertainties in localization and instrumental limitations prevent a definitive detection. Nonetheless, the results highlight the potential for deeper cluster studies, and the estimated neutrino flux $E^{2}\phi_{\nu}\approx3\times10^{-10}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$ motivates future observations with upcoming neutrino telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unified Kraft Break at  6500 K: A Newly Identified Single-Star Obliquity Transition Matches the Classical Rotation Break</a><span class="id">[2511.15610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stellar obliquity transition, defined by a $\textit{T}_{\rm eff}$ cut separating aligned from misaligned hot Jupiter systems, has long been assumed to coincide with the rotational Kraft break. Yet the commonly quoted obliquity transition (6100 or 6250 K) sits a few hundred kelvin cooler than the rotational break ( 6500 K), posing a fundamental inconsistency. We show this offset arises primarily from binaries/multiple-star systems, which drive the cooler stellar obliquity transition ($6105^{+123}_{-133}$ K), although the underlying cause remains ambiguous. After removing binaries and higher-order multiples, the single-star stellar obliquity transition shifts upward to $6447^{+85}_{-119}$ K, in excellent agreement with the single-star rotation break ($6510^{+97}_{-127}$ K). This revision has two immediate consequences for understanding the origin and evolution of spin-orbit misalignment. First, the upward shift reclassifies some hosts previously labeled `hot' into the cooler regime; consequently, there are very few RM measurements of non-hot-Jupiter planets around genuinely hot stars ($T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim6500\,\mathrm{K}$), and previously reported alignment trends for these classes of systems (e.g., warm Jupiters and compact multi-planet systems) lose the power to discriminate the central question: are large misalignments unique to hot-Jupiter-like planets that can be delivered by high-$e$ migration, or are hot stars intrinsically more misaligned across architectures? Second, a single-star stellar obliquity transition near $6500\,\mathrm{K}$, coincident with the rotational break, favors tidal dissipation in outer convective envelopes; as these envelopes thin with increasing $T_{\rm eff}$, inertial-wave damping and magnetic braking weaken in tandem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The JWST weather report from the nearest brown dwarfs III: Heterogeneous clouds and Thermochemical instabilities as possible drivers of WISE 1049AB's spectroscopic variability</a><span class="id">[2511.15667]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new analysis of the spectroscopic variability of WISE J104915.57$-$531906.1AB (WISE 1049AB, L7.5+T0.5), observed using the NIRSpec instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (GO 2965 - PI: Biller). We explored the variability of the dominant molecular bands present in their 0.6–5.3 $\mu$m spectra (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO), finding that the B component exhibits a higher maximum deviation than the A component in all the wavelength ranges tested. The light curves reveal wavelength-(atmospheric depth) and possibly chemistry-dependent variability. In particular, for the A component, the variability in the light curves at the wavelengths traced by the CH$_4$ and CO molecular absorption features is higher than that of H$_2$O, even when both trace similar pressure levels. We concluded that clouds alone are unlikely to explain the increased variability of CO and CH$_4$ with respect to H$_2$O, suggesting that an additional physical mechanism is needed to explain the observed variability. This mechanism is probably due to thermochemical instabilities.

Methods. We perform a comprehensive re-evaluation of the Mg II-3000 Å correlation, explicitly accounting for dispersion introduced by AGN variability. After excluding &gt;3000 radio-loud sources, we employ a binning technique to mitigate variability effects, yielding a refined empirical relation. We also further examine the Non-Thermal Dominance (NTD) parameter, to investigate the dominant source of the continuum. Results. Our analysis reveals statistically significant differences in the slopes of the line-continuum luminosity relation between RQ quasars and FSRQs, with a parallel discrepancy in the Baldwin Effect. These findings imply either (1) intrinsic differences in the accretion disk spectra of RQ AGNs and FSRQs or (2) jet-induced continuum emission in FSRQs contributing to Broad Line Region (BLR) ionization. We also found that a substantial fraction of both RQ quasars (43.8\%) and blazars (55.5\%) exhibit NTD &lt; 1. For blazars, this suggests that the accretion disk alone cannot fully explain BLR ionization; while we interpret NTD &lt; 1 in radio-quiet quasars as a signature of several physical mechanisms: anomalies in the BLR structure (such as outflow or inflows), time lags between continuum and line variations, and the suppression of the UV continuum by a strong corona that diverts accretion power. Finally, we demonstrate that the Baldwin Effect emerges naturally from the line-continuum luminosity relationship, requiring no additional physical mechanism to explain its origin</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Cross-correlation of kSZ and continuity equation velocity reconstruction with photometric DESI LRGs</a><span class="id">[2511.15701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the last year, kinematic Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (kSZ) velocity reconstruction – the measurement of the large-scale velocity field using the anisotropic statistics of the small-scale kSZ-galaxy overdensity correlation – has emerged as a statistically significant probe of the large-scale Universe. In this work, we perform a 2-dimensional tomographic reconstruction using ACT DR6 CMB data and DESI legacy luminous red galaxies (LRGs). We measure the cross-correlation of the kSZ-reconstructed velocity $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ with the velocity inferred from the continuity equation applied to the DESI LRGs $v^{\mathrm{cont}}$ at the $\sim 10 \sigma$ level, detecting the signal with an amplitude with respect to our theory of $b_v = 0.339\pm 0.034$. We fit a scale-dependent galaxy bias model to our measurement in order to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$, finding {$f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}=-180^{+61}_{-86}$} at 67\% confidence, with $f_{\mathrm{NL}}^{\mathrm{loc}}$ consistent with zero at 95\% confidence. We also measure an auto spectrum at $2.1\sigma$ significance which provides a constraint on $b_v$ of $b_v=0.26_{-0.05}^{+0.11}$, which is consistent with the measurement from the cross spectrum. Our combined measurement is $b_v=0.33\pm0.03$, an $11\sigma$ measurement. We find a good fit of our model to the data in all cases. Finally, we use different ACT frequency combinations to explore foreground contamination, finding no evidence for foreground contamination in our velocity cross correlation. We compare to a similar measurement where $v^{\mathrm{kSZ}}$ is directly cross correlated with the large-scale galaxy field, and find signs of foreground contamination which is contained in the equal-redshift spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14790" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas</a><span class="id">[2511.14790]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity.

Behind the exciting story of the Bayeux Tapestry, however, goes a rich mythological world of intrigue, deceit, the succession of kings, and earlier sightings of the same comet. In historical accounts of many cultures, comets are generally considered portents of change rather than disaster. Here we consider the significance of the Tapestry's comet in the context of the so-called English succession crisis of 1066 with reference to other contemporary accounts of comets. We conclude that although the tapestry's illustration is suggestive and unmistakably Halleys Comet, it is not a priority for its creators to give a precise account of its arrival in the sky, but rather connect it, likely for political reasons, albeit retrospectively, to the sequential events of Edwards death and Harolds coronation. In that, the tapestry's anonymous artists provide a unique telling of its arrival.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Physics of Black Holes and Their Environments: Consequences for Gravitational Wave Science</a><span class="id">[2511.14841]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ten short years ago, we had the rare privilege of witnessing the onset of a renaissance in science: humanity finally succeeded in its arduous quest to directly detect gravitational waves.

It is a story of false starts, perseverance, and remarkable insights, propelled as much by technological progress as by human curiosity. We now proudly live in the new golden age of gravitational physics. The detection of gravitational wave signals from the merger of binary black holes and neutron stars are becoming routine.

The purpose of these lecture notes is to help the reader understand the language and framework of this rapidly evolving subject, and to develop the ability to interpret, think, and discuss ideas that lie at the confluence of gravitational wave astronomy and black hole physics. It is our hope that these notes will prepare students and colleagues for the next revolution when gravitational wave events become commonplace and we begin to observe unexpected features in the signal, indicating either surprising astrophysical scenarios or a strong need to modify the theoretical description of gravitational interactions. We provide first principles analysis of black hole and gravitational wave physics, and sometimes a very personal interpretation of results.

The perspectives are especially encouraging for dark photon searches using the Sun as a target, and for axion-like particles conversion in Jupiter's magnetosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">511 keV Gamma Ray Echo from Particle Decays in Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2511.14857]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of a hot and dense core in a core-collapse supernova (SN) can produce massive Beyond Standard Model (BSM) particles. These particles can decay in the stellar envelope, generating positrons either directly or through secondary processes involving neutrinos or photons. We show for the first time that such positrons regardless of their production channel, can thermalize and annihilate at rest with ambient electrons in the outer SN envelope, producing a characteristic echo of 511 keV gamma rays. For axion-like particles (ALPs), we derive bounds on the ALP-photon coupling ($G_{a \gamma}$) using Pioneer Venus Orbiter observations of SN 1987A. We also evaluate the sensitivity of upcoming MeV gap gamma-ray telescopes in the 511 keV range, such as COSI and AMEGO, for future Galactic SNe, which can improve existing constraints or enable ALP discovery. The echo signal is a generic prediction for any particle species that efficiently produces positrons near the stellar surface.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions</a><span class="id">[2511.14864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present updated cosmological constraints on axion-lepton interactions based on state-of-the-art computations of the thermal axion abundance. By combining Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2, we derive improved limits on both lepton-flavor-conserving (LFC) and lepton-flavor-violating (LFV) axion couplings. Incorporating finite axion mass effects substantially strengthens the bounds for axion masses above 0.1 eV compared to those inferred from the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint alone. The bounds on the LFC axion-tau coupling and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are improved by several orders of magnitude and the lower bound on the axion decay constant may exceed $10^6$ and $10^8$ GeV, respectively, for axion masses above 1 eV. Our cosmological constraints on LFC axion couplings to muons and taus and LFV axion couplings to tau and muon or electron are stronger than all other constraints for masses above 0.3 eV. In particular, they are stronger than recent collider constraints from Belle-II on $\tau \rightarrow la$ decays, where $l=e$ or $\mu$. The collider constraints on $\mu \rightarrow ea$ decays are weaker than the cosmological constraints for axion masses above 100 eV. Our results are relevant for both the QCD axion and axion-like particles (ALPs).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IonCast: A Deep Learning Framework for Forecasting Ionospheric Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2511.15004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ionosphere is a critical component of near-Earth space, shaping GNSS accuracy, high-frequency communications, and aviation operations.

We show that the effects of dark energy for a generic modified gravity model can be encoded in a momentum, space and polarization dependent effective matter-gravity coupling, in agreement with the results obtained in some specific theories, and that this is not just related to the effective Planck mass appearing in the action as a coefficient of the Ricci's scalar. Using appropriately defined effective energy tensors, we show that the method can be extended to include also the effects of higher order perturbations. The generality of this effective description of the effects of dark energy on cosmological perturbations gives a solid theoretical justification for the phenomenological approaches often used in the analysis of cosmological observations, allowing to understand the mapping between the results of phenomenological analysis of observational data and theoretical models. The momentum and polarization dependence of the effective gravitational coupling implies that the gravitational energy emitted by a binary coalescence can have an additional frequency and polarization dependence, due to the effects of dark energy perturbations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15081" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power-law Bianchi type I inflation with multiple vector fields</a><span class="id">[2511.15081]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We seek power-law Bianchi type I solutions for an inflationary universe in a model with one scalar field non-minimally coupled to three vector fields aligned along the three axes.

By numerically integrating the complete set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations that describe the evolution of the inflaton field, radiation energy density, and background expansion, we obtain an exact description of the system's dynamics. Our results reveal that, while transition to radiation domination is suppressed in the weak regime, the strong dissipative regime leads to a smooth and natural transition to a hot, radiation-dominated Universe, thereby confirming graceful-exit within warm inflation in the quartic scenario. The reheating temperature is extracted directly from the nonlinear evolution of warm inflation, yielding a temperature of approximately 10^13 GeV at the end of inflation, which cools to about 10^12 GeV near radiation-inflaton equality, whence the Universe transitions into a radiation-dominated era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A New Definition of Horndeski Theory and the Possibility of Multiple Scalar Field Extensions</a><span class="id">[2511.15423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the single-field case, Horndeski provides the most general scalar-tensor theory with second-order field equations.

We characterize Horndeski by two mild axioms: closure under invertible pure disformal transformations and the requirement that the theory includes the minimal Horndeski theory. Under this characterization, we recover the standard single-field action up to boundary terms and obtain a practical path to multi-field constructions.

Wavelengths for 10426 spectral lines were extracted from the FT spectra, with uncertainties at least an order-of-magnitude lower than previous measurements. Wavelengths for 13397 lines from new grating spectra were determined for spectral regions beyond the FT spectra range or to provide wavelengths for weak transitions not observed in FT spectra. To aid in level identification, selected, previously published grating lines were included in the energy level optimisation, but no levels in this work relied solely on previously published wavelengths. In total, 24237 lines were included in the final spectral linelist, and these were used to identify 2186 Mn I transitions. These classified spectral lines were then used to optimise the values of 384 previously published energy levels of Mn I, with typical uncertainties of a few 10-3 cm-1, again typically an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. Our study then expanded the known energy level structure of Mn I through the establishment of 18 new energy levels, reported here for the first time. In total, 2187 lines and 402 energy levels of Mn I have been determined as a result of our work, marking a substantial advance in the precision of Mn I atomic data which will enable far more accurate analyses of Mn I lines in astrophysical spectra. Please note: The final wavelength and energy level datasets are withheld from this pre-print to ensure that only the peer-reviewed, definitive versions are released. This approach prevents the propagation of duplicate or inconsistent data across widely used atomic databases and modelling frameworks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath: space-time correlation using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission</a><span class="id">[2511.15579]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spatiotemporal correlation of magnetic field fluctuations is investigated using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetosheath.

Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfvénic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides unprecedented insight into the space-time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic mean-field model with density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings</a><span class="id">[2511.15646]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new hadronic EoS with hyperons built within the relativistic mean-field (RMF) formalism with baryon-density- and isospin-density-dependent couplings.

In this paper, I propose two possible formation channels for NSs inside PNe. First, using simulations performed with the MESA stellar evolution code, I present a scenario in which NSs form via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) white dwarfs (WDs) inside PNe–referred to here as symbiotic nebulae. In the late evolutionary stages of ONeMg WD-red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, substantial mass loss can occur through strong stellar winds or/and Roche-lobe overflow, potentially leading to the formation of nebulae surrounding central accreting WD binaries. These nebulae may be ionized by the hot cores of the giant stars or by the accreting WDs themselves. Under such conditions, the accreting WD may grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit and undergo collapse into a neutron star. NSs formed via this AIC channel are likely to retain WD companions, resulting in NS-WD binary systems, of which the Milky Way may host dozens. Second, through binary population synthesis modeling, I introduce another evolutionary pathway: the core-merger-induced collapse occurring during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries. This process may result in the formation of a newborn NS within a PN-or, in some cases, a pulsar wind nebula.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Halo spin and orientation in Interacting Dark Matter Dark Energy Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2501.03750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, the interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) has become a topic of interest in cosmology.

This impact can be examined through the shape and spin orientation of halos in numerical simulations incorporating IDE effects. In our work, we use the N-body simulation pipeline ME-GADGET to simulate and study the halo spin and orientation in IDE models. We found that in models where DM transfers into DE (IDE I), the alignment of halo shapes with the surrounding tidal field is enhanced, while the alignment of halo spins with the tidal field is decreased compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Conversely, in models where DE transfers into DM (IDE II), the opposite occurs. We have provided fitted functions to describe these alignment signals.

A component of warm white noise emerges in our analysis, which arises due to the finite number density and undergoes scale-dependent evolution because of the velocity dispersion. Although free streaming erases adiabatic initial perturbations on small scales, warm white noise persists below the free-streaming length and grows during matter domination, with growth suppressed below the dark matter Jeans length. Our calculated power spectra agree with $N$-body simulations in the linear regime and accurately predict halo mass functions in the nonlinear regime. Effects of warm white noise can emerge on observable quasi-linear scales for ultralight dark matter produced after inflation with a subhorizon correlation length.

We utilise two machine learning (ML) models for denosing: generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM). We evaluate the performance of denosing with GAN and DM utilising the large suite of mock WL observations, which serve as the training and test data sets. We apply denoising to 1,000 noisy mass maps with GAN and DM models trained with 39,000 mock observations. Both models can fairly well reproduce the true convergence map on large scales. Then, we measure cosmological statistics: power spectrum, bispectrum, one-point probability distribution function, peak and minima counts, and scattering transform coefficients. We find that DM outperforms GAN in almost all considered statistics and recovers the correct statistics down to small scales. For example, the angular power spectrum can be recovered with DM up to multipoles $\ell \lesssim 6000$ while the noise power spectrum dominates from $\ell \simeq 2000$. We also conduct stress tests on the trained model; denoising the maps with different characteristics, e.g., different source redshifts, from the training data. The performance degrades at small scales, but the statistics can still be recovered at large scales. Though the training of DM is more computationally demanding compared with GAN, there are several advantages: numerically stable training, higher performance in the reconstruction of cosmological statistics, and sampling multiple realisations once the model is trained. It has been known that DM can generate higher-quality images in real-world problems than GAN, the superiority has been confirmed as well in the WL denoising problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of a Type-C QPO during the soft-to-hard transition in Swift J1727.8-1613</a><span class="id">[2505.07938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Timing analysis of accreting systems is key to probe the structure and dynamics around compact objects. In Black-Hole Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (BH LMXBs), the compact object accretes matter from a low-mass companion star via Roche Lobe overflow, forming an accretion disk, and occasionally exhibiting bright eruptions. The BH LMXB Swift J1727.8-1613 (hereafter J1727), recently underwent one of the brightest outbursts ever recorded in X-rays, in August 2023. This analysis aims to study the timing properties of J1727, in the decaying phase of its outburst, using high-time resolution XMM-Newton data. We analyzed J1727's power spectrum (PS) and cross spectrum (CS), which we modeled with Lorentzians. The PS reveals how the source's power is distributed across frequencies, and the Real and Imaginary parts of the CS compare the displacement of the light curves in different energy bands across the observations. Finally, we simultaneously derived the phase lags and the coherence, using a constant phase lag model. While the first (soft-state) observation does not show any strong variability, the two harder observations exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Because the QPO is more significantly detected in the Imaginary part of the CS than in the PS, we refer to it as the 'Imaginary QPO'. The QPO is more prominent in the soft 0.3-2 keV band than in the hard 2-12 keV band. As the source evolves towards the hard state, the Imaginary QPO shifts to lower frequencies, the broadband fractional rms amplitude in the 0.3-2 keV energy band increases, while the rms covariance of the Imaginary QPO decreases. Simultaneously, the phase lags increase and the coherence function drops at the Imaginary QPO frequency. In the elusive soft-to-hard transition of J1727, the first XMM-Newton observations of the source reveal an Imaginary QPO also detected in the PS, exhibiting the properties of a type-C QPO.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smoking gun signature from axion and the constraints with radio telescopes</a><span class="id">[2506.05795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions are an elegant solution to the strong CP problem for particle physics and a promising dark matter candidate.

We present measurements of galaxy cluster projection effects and velocity dispersion using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our findings are as follows: we confirm that the fraction of redMaPPer putative member galaxies mistakenly associated with cluster haloes is richness dependent, being more than twice as large at low richness than high richness; we present the first spectroscopic evidence of an increase in projection effects with increasing redshift, by as much as 25 per cent from $z\sim0.1$ to $z\sim0.2$; moreover, we find qualitative evidence for luminosity dependence in projection effects, with fainter galaxies being more commonly far behind clusters than their bright counterparts; finally we fit the scaling relation between measured mean spectroscopic richness and velocity dispersion, finding an implied linear scaling between spectroscopic richness and halo mass.

Previous work has shown that idealized models of the torque based on a single body moving in rectilinear motion through an unperturbed atmosphere can be highly inaccurate. Progress requires new models for the torque that account for binarity. Toward this end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of the companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant branch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation. First, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to their separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density pattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is roughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial distribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose major axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary components by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably well, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we compare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model that assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a uniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with our results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction ( 0.44) of the density at the spheroid surface. Overall, this work makes progress toward developing simple time-dependent models of the CE phase, for example by informing the development of drag force prescriptions for 1D spherically symmetric CE simulations, which could be used to explore the parameter space of luminous red novae or in binary population synthesis studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The source of the cosmic-ray excess in the Centaurus region – constraints on possible candidates, mass composition and cosmic magnetic fields</a><span class="id">[2509.06594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The most significant excess in the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with energies $\gtrsim40\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is found in the direction of several interesting source candidates, most prominently the nearby radio galaxy Centaurus A.

Leveraging the measured overdensity direction, significance, angular scale, and energy evolution, we place limits on the allowed signal fraction, the possible ejected charge number and the strength of the extragalactic magnetic field between the respective source and Earth. We find that the scenario of a subdominant source in the overdensity region requires the charge number to be $Z\lesssim6$ and the extragalactic magnetic field quantity $B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}$ to be between $~1$ and $~100$. For the Sombrero galaxy to be the source, the dominant charge number has to be around $Z=6$ with $1\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}\lesssim20$. We find that a scenario where all the flux above $30\,\mathrm{EeV}$ is supplied by Cen A or M83 is possible for $20\lesssim B/\mathrm{nG} \sqrt{L_c/\mathrm{Mpc}}\lesssim30$ and a mixed composition - explaining both the Centaurus region excess and the distribution of the highest-energy events - however, another contributing source is possibly required in the energy range $&lt;30\,\mathrm{EeV}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting Local and Integrated Relativistic Effects by Multi-Tracing a Single Galaxy Population in Harmonic Space</a><span class="id">[2509.08056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measuring relativistic effects on cosmological scales would provide further confirmation of the validity of general relativity in the still poorly tested condition of weak gravity. Despite their relevance, relativistic imprints in the distribution of galaxies on large scales have so far eluded detection, mainly because they are stronger on the largest cosmic scales, which are plagued by cosmic variance. Expanding on previous works, we study galaxy clustering by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples – bright and faint – and we here focus on their two-point correlation function in harmonic space, i.e. via the angular power spectrum. Thanks to such a split in magnitude and by exploiting the multi-tracer technique, we are able to boost the impact of the relativistic contributions. We first focus on the leading relativistic contribution given by the Doppler effect and show that, with a carefully tailored luminosity cut, it can be detected. Then, we look at the sub-dominant effects predicted by general relativity and quantify how their statistical significance, as yet undetectable, varies with redshift binning and survey specifications. As case studies, we consider in our forecasts a bright galaxy sample at low redshift, an H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxy survey at intermediate redshifts, and high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies at high redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological constraints on nonphantom dynamical dark energy with DESI Data Release 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillations: A 3$σ$+ lensing anomaly</a><span class="id">[2509.26144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider a 12-parameter cosmological model with non-phantom dynamical dark energy (NPDDE), where non-phantom implies that the equation of state (EoS) of dark energy (DE), $w(z)\geq-1$ for all redshifts $z$. Thus, the DE EoS covers the parameter space corresponding to the popular single scalar-field dark energy models, i.e., Quintessence. The cosmological model comprises 6 parameters of the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, and additionally the dynamical DE EoS parameters ($w_0$, $w_a$), the scaling of the lensing amplitude ($A_{\rm lens}$), sum of the neutrino masses ($\sum m_\nu$), the effective number of non-photon relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). We derive constraints on the parameters by combining the latest Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release (DR) 2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements with cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra from Planck Public Release (PR) 4, CMB lensing data from Planck PR4 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6, uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae (SNe) data from the Pantheon+ and Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 5 (DESY5) samples, and Weak Lensing (WL) data from DES Year 1. Our major finding is that with CMB+BAO+WL and CMB+BAO+SNe+WL, we find 3$\sigma$+ evidence for $A_{\rm lens} &gt;1$, indicating a higher than expected CMB lensing amplitude relative to the NPDDE prediction of unity. This implies that for cosmology to accommodate realistic quintessence-like dark energy models (as opposed to unrealistic phantom DE), one would also need to explain a relatively significant presence of the lensing anomaly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital decay candidates reconsidered: WASP-4 b is not decaying and Kepler-1658 b is not a planet</a><span class="id">[2510.05229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay.

By combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to an  7 Jupiter-mass companion at  8 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the &quot;planet&quot; to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change.

The approximation is implemented in CLASSIER (CLASS Integral Equation Revision), a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS that replaces the traditional truncated Boltzmann hierarchy of non-cold relic multipoles with a small set of integral equations solved iteratively. Applying it to massive neutrinos yields a factor-of-two reduction in total runtime relative to CLASSIER without the approximation. Compared to standard CLASS runs (with $\ell_{\rm max}^{\rm NCDM}=40$ and no late-time massive neutrino fluid approximation) under the same precision setting, CLASSIER with this approximation is faster by a factor of 3-6. The approximation faithfully reproduces the late-time behavior of massive neutrino perturbations and preserves sub-$0.1\%$ accuracy in the matter power spectrum today up to comoving wavenumber $k=100\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. With this approximation, massive-neutrino perturbations are no longer the computational bottleneck on small scales for linear-theory predictions. The approach can be readily extendable to non-standard dark-matter models, and offers prospects for further efficiency gains in high-precision cosmological analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM Spectroscopy of the Stellar-mass Black Hole GRS 1915+105</a><span class="id">[2510.25089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRS 1915$+$105 was the stellar-mass black hole that best reproduced key phenomena that are also observed in Type-1 active galactic nuclei. In recent years, however, it has evolved to resemble a Type-2 or Compton-thick AGN. Herein, we report on the first XRISM observation of GRS 1915$+$105. The high-resolution Resolve calorimeter spectrum reveals that a sub-Eddington central engine is covered by a layer of warm, Compton-thick gas. With the obscuration acting as a coronagraph, numerous strong, narrow emission lines from He-like and H-like charge states of Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, Mn, Fe, and Ni dominate the spectrum. Radiative recombination continuum (RRC) features are also observed, signaling that much of the emitting gas is photoionized. The line spectrum can be fit by three photoionized emission zones, with broadening and bulk velocities suggestive of an origin in the outer disk atmosphere and/or a slow wind at $r \simeq 10^{6}~GM/c^{2}$. The Fe XXV He-$\alpha$ and Fe XXVI Ly-$\alpha$ lines have a broad base that may indicate some emission from $r \sim 3\times 10^{3}~GM/c^{2}$. These results broadly support a picture wherein the current state in GRS 1915$+$105 is due to obscuration by the irradiated outer disk. This could arise through disk thickening if the Eddington fraction is higher than inferred, but it is more likely due to a warped, precessing disk that has brought the outer disk into the line of sight. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of this interpretation and our modeling, and possible explanations of some potentially novel spectral features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An extremely fast fading population II dwarf nova candidate: caught spectroscopically on the rise</a><span class="id">[2510.26682]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present AT2022kak, a rapidly evolving optical transient discovered by the KiloNova and Transients Program (KNTraP).

We deployed a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, monitoring the object for the next two months, but saw no recurrent burst. Three years later, while observing to get spectroscopy of the object in quiescence, there was a new outburst, enabling the collection of time-resolved spectra of the rise and fade of the outburst. The light curve properties of the first burst and spectra of the second burst are consistent with a dwarf nova. Its fast evolving behaviour makes it one of the fastest and faintest dwarf novae observed. The estimated distance of AT2022kak from the Galactic centre is  6.6 kpc, with a scale height of  2 kpc. This scale height places it in the Galactic thick disk, where only very few dwarf novae have been found, and is therefore a potential Population II dwarf novae system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kerr Black Hole Shadows in Dispersive Plasma: Frequency-Dependent Geodesics and Shadow Distortions</a><span class="id">[2511.06466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The black hole shadow, a direct probe of the event horizon's gravitational influence, has been observationally confirmed by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). While theoretical models of shadows in vacuum are mature, real astrophysical black holes like M87* and Sgr A* are enveloped in plasma, which can alter photon trajectories through dispersion. Current understanding, based on foundational work, indicates that only specific plasma distributions allow for an analytical treatment via the separation of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we build upon this framework to systematically investigate the propagation of light rays in Kerr spacetime surrounded by a pressureless, non-magnetized cold plasma. We explicitly derive the separability condition, identifying the exact class of plasma densities that permit a generalized Carter constant. For these models, we compute the photon regions and shadow boundaries, characterizing how the shadow's size and shape deviate from the vacuum case in a frequency-dependent manner. Our results provide analytical benchmarks for the distortion of shadows in dispersive media and determine the critical plasma frequency beyond which the shadow is erased, offering a direct link between observable shadow features and the properties of the ambient plasma environment and providing a foundation for studying more dynamic, non-separable plasma distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST/NIRCam observations of HD 92945 debris disk: An asymmetric disk with a gap</a><span class="id">[2511.07561]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first observations of the HD92945 debris disk obtained with JWST, targeting this nearby K0V star located at 21.54 pc from the Sun. High-contrast coronagraphic imaging was performed using JWST/NIRCam in the F200W and F444W filters. After subtracting the disk contribution through forward modeling by means of synthetic PSFs and MCMC optimizations, the residuals were analyzed to identify candidate point sources. From these, we derived contrast curves and constructed detection probability maps for substellar companions. The disk is clearly detected in both NIRCam filters and reveals a broad, inclined structure with a gap, consistent with previous scattered-light and ALMA observations. The modeling confirms the presence of a gap at  80 au and shows a scale height and scattering properties compatible with a dynamically active disk. A significant brightness asymmetry is observed in the southwestern inner ring at both 2 and 4.4 {\mu}m, consistent with previous ALMA results. Observing this feature across different wavelengths and epochs strongly supports a scenario where one or more unseen planetary companions are perturbing the disk. No comoving sources are detected, and all candidate objects in the field are consistent with background stars or galaxies. The derived detection limits exclude planets more massive than  0.4-0.5 MJ beyond 100 au and more massive than  1 MJ beyond 20-40 au. This, in turn, rules out the possibility of a single planet placed beyond  20 au as responsible for the astrometric signal observed by Gaia. These results, combined with the observed disk features, support a scenario in which a single or multiple sub-Jupiter planets dynamically shape the system through mechanisms such as secular apsidal resonances, providing a coherent explanation for the gap, the asymmetric brightness distribution and the astrometric signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conservation laws in non-inertial frames and non-conservation of energy of relative motion in two-body problem</a><span class="id">[2511.08709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of systems of multiple gravitationally interacting bodies is often studied in a frame attached to one of the objects (e.g. a central star in a planetary system). As this frame is generally non-inertial, indirect forces appear in the equations describing the motion of bodies relative to the reference object. According to the convention adopted in celestial mechanics, the associated indirect acceleration is defined to be different for every object under consideration, whereas the gravitational coupling between each body and the reference object is described via the effective two-body potential, which does not obey the equivalence principle. Here we point out that a slightly different and more physically motivated definition of the indirect acceleration provides significant benefits when interpreting relative motion in a non-inertial frame. First, the indirect acceleration ends up being the same for all objects in the system. Second, the non-conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy of the whole system in a non-inertial frame naturally follow from the action of the indirect acceleration on the system as an external force. We also argue that the vis viva integral of the classical two-body problem should not be interpreted as a statement of energy conservation. In fact, the energy of relative motion is not conserved due to the work done on the two-body system by the indirect force. These results can be useful for interpreting dynamics in various astrophysical contexts, in particular the physics of disc-planet coupling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Occurrence rate of stellar Type II radio bursts from a 100 star-year search for coronal mass ejections</a><span class="id">[2511.09296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather in the Solar System, but their occurrence rate on other stars is unknown. A characteristic (deca-)metric radio burst with a time-frequency drift, known as a Type II radio burst, is a key observational signature of CMEs. We searched a total of 107 years of stellar data using time-frequency spectra that targeted all known stars within 100 parsecs in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) up to May 2023. This resulted in the largest unbiased search for circularly polarised stellar Type II metric radio bursts to date, with a typical 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of 2.5 mJy for an integration time of 1 minute. We detected two drifting stellar radio bursts: the published 2-minute burst from the M dwarf StKM 1-1262 and a new 13-minute burst from the M dwarf LP 215-56. The new burst is characterised by a drift rate of $-0.060^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ MHz s$^{-1}$, an average Stokes V flux density of $-4.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ mJy, and a temporal duration of $63^{+31}_{-11}$ seconds. We constrained the occurrence rate of drifting stellar bursts by calculating Poisson upper and lower limits based on the two drifting bursts. We also fitted a cumulative burst luminosity distribution to the data using the burst detections and the non-detections; this yielded a power law index ($\alpha$) of $-0.7^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ and a normalisation point (N) of one burst per year with $E&gt;6.8\times10^{13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We find an agreement between this and the cumulative luminosity distribution of decametric SOHO/LASCO solar Type II data ($\alpha = -0.81 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.02$), which suggests that the current scarcity of detected stellar Type II bursts is likely due to limited sensitivity rather than to the intrinsic rarity of these events. Additionally, we identify 19 circularly polarised stellar radio bursts without a time-frequency drift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recalibrating Inflation: Insights from Starobinsky Gravity</a><span class="id">[2511.11339]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent analyses of low-redshift supernova and Cepheid data reveal localized shifts in the distance modulus, often interpreted as calibration anomalies or hints of new physics.

However, the presence of bright foregrounds over four orders of magnitude stronger than the HI signal makes its extraction highly challenging. While all methods perform well when assuming a Gaussian beam degraded to the worst resolution, most of them degrade significantly in the presence of a more realistic beam model. In this work, we investigate the performance of SDecGMCA. This method extends DecGMCA to spherical data, combining sparse component separation with beam deconvolution. Our goal is to evaluate this method in comparison with established foreground removal techniques, assessing its ability to recover the cosmological HI signal from single-dish intensity mapping observations under varying beam conditions. We use simulated HI signal and foregrounds, covering the frequency ranges relevant to MeerKAT and SKA-Mid. The foreground removal techniques tested fall into two main categories: model-fitting methods (polynomial and parametric) and blind source separation methods (PCA, ICA, GMCA, and SDecGMCA). Their effectiveness is evaluated based on the recovery of the HI angular and frequency power spectra under progressively more realistic beam conditions. While all methods perform adequately under a uniform degraded beam, SDecGMCA remains robust when frequency-dependent beam distortions are introduced. In the oscillating beam case, SDecGMCA suppresses the spurious spectral peak at $k_\nu \sim 0.3$ and achieves $\lesssim 5\%$ accuracy at intermediate angular scales ($10 &lt; \ell &lt; 200$), outperforming other methods. Beam inversion, however, remains intrinsically unstable beyond $\ell \sim 200$, setting a practical limit on the method.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Flares in the TESS Light Curves of Planet-hosting M dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2511.13716]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>M dwarfs are magnetically active stars that frequently produce flares, which have implications for both stellar evolution and exoplanet studies. Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period. We search TESS observations of a known active population of M dwarfs as well as a volume-limited sample of M dwarfs within 15 parsecs. We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($\alpha$) across activity levels. We find $\alpha =1.99 \pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $\alpha = 1.94 \pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $\alpha = 2.03 \pm 0.43$ for those with &gt; 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $\alpha$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismic Imprints of Mass Transfer in Binary Stars: Probing the Interiors of Donors and Accretors with Gravity and Acoustic Modes</a><span class="id">[2511.14372]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The synergy between close binary stars and asteroseismology enables constraints on mass-transfer episodes and their consequences for internal structure, rotation profiles, and oscillation modes. Aims. We investigate how mass accretion and donation in close binaries affects the internal structure and oscillation modes of main-sequence stars. Methods. Building on the established relation between the Brunt-Vaisala (buoyancy) glitch and the Fourier spectra of g-mode period spacings, we quantitatively explain the origins of the g-mode period-spacing differences between single-star and mass-accretion/donation models of intermediate-mass stars (M = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 Msun). In particular, the hydrogen mass fraction profiles X of the donor model show two chemical gradient regions, which results in a double-peaked Brunt-Vaisala profile. The presence of additional buoyancy glitches gives rise to further periodic modulations in the g-mode period spacings. Results. Mass-accretion induced changes in the chemical profile create sharp features in the buoyancy frequency, which modify both the amplitudes and frequencies of the g-mode period-spacing variations. This behavior resembles that produced by multiple chemical transition zones in compact pulsators such as white dwarfs and sub-dwarf B stars. Similarly, for acoustic modes in the M = 1 Msun solar-like models, we attribute the differences in frequency-separation ratios between single-star and mass-donor models to the variations in the internal sound-speed gradient (acoustic glitches). We discuss future prospects for using asteroseismology to discover the mass-transfer products and constrain the mass-transfer processes in binary star evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detector Response to Gravitational Wave Polarizations in Gravitational Quantum Field Theory</a><span class="id">[2504.01809]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of gravitational wave polarization modes within Gravitational Quantum Field Theory (GQFT), a unified theoretical framework reconciling general relativity and quantum field theory.

Nonetheless, events like GW190521 show that strong spin precession can indeed be gleaned. In this work, we track how spin precession imprints on simulated high-mass binary black hole signals cycle-by-cycle using time-domain inference. We investigate a suite of signals, all with the same spins and (near-unity) mass ratio – yielding identical spin evolution – but different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), total masses, and extrinsic angles, all of which affect the observed waveform morphology. We truncate each signal at various times and infer source parameters using only the data before or after each cutoff. The resultant posterior allows us to identify which time segments of each signal inform its spin precession constraints. We find that at a sufficiently high post-peak SNR ($\sim 20$), spin precession can be constrained by the NRSur7dq4 waveform model when just the post-peak data (i.e., ringdown) are visible. Similarly, at a large enough pre-cutoff SNR ($\sim 10$), spin precession can be constrained using only pre-peak data (i.e., inspiral); this occurs for signals with detector-frame total mass $\lesssim 100 M_{\odot}$ at GW190521's full-signal SNR. Finally, we vary the inclination, polarization, and phase angles, finding that their configuration need not be fine-tuned to measure spin precession, even for very high-mass and short signals with two to three observable cycles. We do not find that the same morphological features consistently drive precession constraints: in some signals, precession inference hinges on the relationship between a loud merger and quiet pre-merger cycle, as was the case for GW190521, but this is not generically true.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter.

We also obtain constraints from quasar absorption spectra and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightweight posterior construction for gravitational-wave catalogs with the Kolmogorov-Arnold network</a><span class="id">[2508.18698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neural density estimation has seen widespread applications in the gravitational-wave (GW) data analysis, which enables real-time parameter estimation for compact binary coalescences and enhances rapid inference for subsequent analysis such as population inference. In this work, we explore the application of using the Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) to construct efficient and interpretable neural density estimators for lightweight posterior construction of GW catalogs. By replacing conventional activation functions with learnable splines, KAN achieves superior interpretability, higher accuracy, and greater parameter efficiency on related scientific tasks. Leveraging this feature, we propose a KAN-based neural density estimator, which ingests megabyte-scale GW posterior samples and compresses them into model weights of tens of kilobytes. Subsequently, analytic expressions requiring only several kilobytes can be further distilled from these neural network weights with minimal accuracy trade-off. In practice, GW posterior samples with fidelity can be regenerated rapidly using the model weights or analytic expressions for subsequent analysis. Our lightweight posterior construction strategy is expected to facilitate user-level data storage and transmission, paving a path for efficient analysis of numerous GW events in the next-generation GW detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A General Framework for the Spontaneous Scalarization of Regular Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2511.01544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the spontaneous scalarization of generic, static, and spherically symmetric regular black holes supported by nonlinear electrodynamics. Starting from an arbitrary seed metric, we employ the P-dual formalism to reconstruct the electromagnetic sector and subsequently couple a real scalar field nonminimally. As a worked example, we apply the framework to the regular Balart-Vagenas black hole, showing that scalarized and scalar-free branches can coexist in a region where the scalarized configurations are entropically preferred. We further assess possible observational imprints, finding percent-level deviations in both the shadow size and the fundamental scalar quasi-normal modes ($&lt; 10\%$ for small charge-to-mass ratios), indicating that current electromagnetic and gravitational-wave observations do not rule out these solutions. Our construction thus provides a general route to explore scalarization on top of nonlinear-electrodynamics-supported spacetimes, extending beyond specific Reissner-Nordström-like cases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-Scale Calculations of $β$-Decay Rates and Implications for $r$-Process Nucleosynthesis</a><span class="id">[2511.02999]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nuclear $\beta$ decay is a key element of the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process ($r$-process). In this paper, we present state-of-the-art global $\beta$-decay calculations based on the quantified relativistic nuclear energy density functional theory and the deformed proton-neutron quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Our analysis considers contributions from allowed and first-forbidden transitions. We used two point-coupling functionals with carefully calibrated time-odd terms and isoscalar pairing strength. The new calculations display consistent results for both employed functionals, especially near the neutron drip line, suggesting slower $\beta$ decays past the $N=126$ neutron shell closure than in commonly used $\beta$-decay models. The new rates, along with the existing rates based on the latest non-relativistic calculations, are found to slow down the synthesis of heavy elements in the $r$-process and significantly reduce the contribution of neutron-induced fission.</p></div></details></article></body>
