A key diagnostic for their nature is the spiral arm pattern speed: the radial profile of the angular rotation rate of spiral features. This profile determines the location and number of dynamical resonances where peculiar motions and azimuthal metallicity fluctuations in stars and gas can manifest; their precise patterns have the potential to support or reject theories of spiral structure. However, limited observations of this type have been carried out so far, despite an increasing number of theoretical predictions emerging from realistic and detailed cosmological simulations. A systematic observational programme focussed on the resolved kinematics and metallicities of stellar populations around galaxy spiral arms is required to confront these predictions. This calls for wide-area multi-object spectrographs on 12m-class telescopes capable of accurately capturing such data across the full coverage of spiral arms in nearby galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The accretion of quasars at the epoch of reionisation: $JWST$ catches the primeval monsters slowly feasting</a><span class="id">[2512.16981]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasars (QSOs) emit an enormous amount of light as a result of the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Thanks to their luminosity, the most distant known QSOs allow us to trace the growth of SMBHs deep into the epoch of reionisation. In this work, we employed $JWST$/NIRSpec observations of eight luminous (log$(L_{3000\,A^{\circ}}/(erg \, s^{-1}))&gt;$45.7) QSOs at $z\geq$5.9 to constrain their accretion properties, namely black hole mass, accretion disc (AD) luminosity, and Eddington ratio ($M_{BH}$, $L_{AD}$, $\lambda_{Edd}$), by fitting the rest-frame UV and optical emission with different AD models. This method provided self-consistent measurements of both $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$. The uncertainties on $M_{BH}$ and $L_{AD}$, obtained within the AD-modelling framework ($\sigma^{AD}_{M_{BH}}\sim$0.2 dex; $\sigma^{AD}_{L_{AD}}\sim$0.1 dex), are significantly smaller than the systematic uncertainties associated with single-epoch $M_{BH}$ ($\sim$0.4 dex) and $L_{AD}$ derived via bolometric corrections ($\sim$0.2 dex). Based on these results, in our sample we found an average Eddington ratio of $\langle \log(\lambda_{Edd}) \rangle=-0.9$, with a dispersion of $\sim$0.2 dex. Assuming that our high-z QSOs are representative of optically-selected bright blue QSOs, we derive a fraction of systems accreting above the Eddington limit of $\sim$0.2%. In conclusion, this work i) demonstrates the suitability of $JWST$ to test AD models on high-redshift ($z\gtrsim$4) QSOs, thanks to the large NIRSpec spectral coverage; ii) shows that AD modelling can yield robust $M_{\rm BH}$ and $L_{\rm AD}$ measurements, with smaller uncertainties than the typical calibrations; and iii) provides compelling evidence for sub-Eddington accretion in bright high-$z$ QSOs, challenging the widespread paradigm of near- or super-Eddington accretion occurring in these sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reviving sub-keV warm dark matter: a UVLF-based analysis</a><span class="id">[2512.16987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thermal warm dark matter (WDM) particles with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 1~\mathrm{keV}$ are ruled out at more than $4\sigma$ by multiple observational probes, owing to the strong suppression of small-scale structure induced by early-time free-streaming. Recently, it was highlighted that a small admixture of $\sim1\%$ ($f_{\rm CDM} \sim\!0.01$) cold dark matter (CDM) endowed with a blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum could offset the WDM-induced suppression and relax the WDM mass bound by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)$. If viable, this ”warm + cold-isocurvature” scenario would allow sub-keV WDM particles to constitute nearly the full dark matter abundance while potentially alleviating some small-scale tensions. In this work, we test this mechanism by constraining the WDM mass $m_{\rm WDM}$ while marginalizing over CDM isocurvature parameters. We combine ultraviolet luminosity function measurements from the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} and \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} over redshift $4 \leq z \leq 11$ with CMB, BAO, and SNe data. For a pure WDM model, our joint analysis yields a lower bound $m_{\rm WDM} &gt; 1.8~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals). When CDM isocurvature is introduced at $f_{\rm CDM} = 0.01$, the limit relaxes to $m_{\rm WDM} &gt; 0.27~\mathrm{keV}$ (95% credible intervals), reflecting a shallow degeneracy in which blue-tilted isocurvature fluctuations partially compensate for WDM suppression. These results provide new constraints on thermal WDM in the presence of CDM isocurvature fluctuations and quantify the extent to which such fluctuations can mask the small-scale signatures of light relics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AURORA Survey: The Mass – Metallicity and Fundamental Metallicity Relations at $z \sim 2.3$ Based Purely on Direct $T_e$ Metallicities</a><span class="id">[2512.16989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new constraints on the Mass – Metallicity (MZR) and Fundamental Metallicity Relations (FMR) using a sample of 34 galaxies at $1.38\leq~z\leq~3.5$ (median $z=2.28$). These galaxies have direct $T_e$ measurements from [O\sc{iii}]4363Å and/or [O\sc{ii}]7320,7331Å auroral emission lines detected with \textit{JWST}/NIRSpec as part of the AURORA survey. The detection of both oxygen auroral lines allows for dual-zone direct $T_e$ measurements and expands the dynamic range in $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ (7.68 to 8.65 dex), stellar mass ($10^{8}$ to $10^{10.4}$ M$_\odot$), and star-formation rate ($1$ to $100$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) compared to previous direct $T_e$ studies of the high-redshift MZR and FMR. We characterize the $z\sim2$ MZR and find a slope of $0.27\pm0.04$ and normalization of $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)} = 8.44\pm0.04$ at $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ with an intrinsic scatter of 0.10 dex, consistent with past strong-line MZR measurements. Comparisons with $z\sim2$ predictions from six simulations reveal that none reproduce our observed MZR normalization evolution between $z\sim0$ and $z\sim2$. This discrepancy suggests current models do not fully capture the chemical enrichment and feedback processes occurring at cosmic noon. However, all 34 galaxies are on or above the star-forming main sequence such that our sample may be biased towards lower $12+\log\mathrm{(O/H)}$ if the FMR persists at $z\sim2$. Correcting for this selection effect would increase O/H by $\approx0.1$ dex at 10$^{9.3}$ M$_\odot$ (the median mass of our sample) bringing our MZR into better agreement with that of \texttt{TNG}. Lastly, we find our $z\sim2.3$ sample is consistent with the $z\sim0$ FMR within 0.1 dex in O/H, indicating that the smooth secular mechanisms regulating chemical enrichment, star formation, stellar mass, and outflows were in place at cosmic noon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The supernova Ia progenitor problem in the 2040s</a><span class="id">[2512.16991]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are fundamental to cosmology and galactic chemical evolution, yet the nature of their progenitor systems remains unresolved. Multiple evolutionary pathways, including single-degenerate, double-degenerate, and helium-donor systems, are thought to contribute to the SN Ia population, but direct observational constraints are limited. This uncertainty hampers our understanding of SN Ia diversity and introduces systematic uncertainties in their use as precision cosmological probes. By the 2040s, surveys such as Gaia, LSST, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and the gravitational-wave mission LISA will identify thousands of compact binaries in the Milky Way that are potential SN Ia progenitors. However, survey discoveries alone are insufficient. Robust identification and characterization require high-time-resolution, phase-resolved spectroscopy to determine fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital inclinations, chemical compositions, and accretion states. Addressing these challenges demands new observational capabilities. The most compact binaries require continuous, dead-time-free spectroscopy with negligible readout noise, while the progenitor population spans a wide range of brightness and orbital periods. A modular, multi-aperture telescope array equipped with fast, low-noise spectrographs can flexibly combine collecting area for faint targets, observe bright systems efficiently, and deliver uninterrupted time series through staggered exposures. Such observations are difficult for single-aperture facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empirical instability strip for classical Cepheids II. The Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy</a><span class="id">[2512.16997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. This study aims to determine empirical intrinsic edges of the classical Cepheids instability strip (IS) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) galaxy, considering various effects that alter its shape, and compare them with theoretical models and other galaxies. Methods. We used the data of classical fundamental-mode (F) and first-overtone mode (1O) SMC Cepheids from the OGLE-IV variable star catalog, with the final cleaned sample including 2388 F and 1560 1O Cepheids. The IS borders are determined by tracing the edges of the color distribution along the strip. Based on that, and using evolutionary tracks, the IS crossing times are computed. Results. We obtained the blue and red edges of the IS in V- and I-photometric bands and in the HR diagram, and detected breaks at periods between 1.4 and 3 days. A comparison with existing theoretical models showed good agreement for the blue edge and significant differences for the red edge. We also found that the IS of the SMC is wider than that of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), with its red edge being redder despite its lower metallicity. The analysis of crossing times showed that the expected number of Cepheids as a function of period agrees with the observed distribution for P &gt; 1 days but differs for P &lt; 1 days. Conclusions. Slope changes along the SMC IS borders are most likely explained by the distribution of metallicity. The behavior of the blue loops at the SMC metallicity is not consistent with observations, and at the LMC metallicity, the blue loops are too short for lower-mass stars. A comparison of theoretical edges with our empirical ISs imposes constraints on the models and enables the identification of valid ones. Based on the positions of the breaks, our study also suggests that fundamental-mode Cepheids with periods longer than 3 days should be used for distance determination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Archaeological investigation of galaxies' evolutionary history in the cosmic middle ages</a><span class="id">[2512.16998]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic Middle Ages, spanning the last 8-10 Gyr of the Universe, is a critical period in which massive early-formed systems coexist with global star formation quenching in less massive galaxies, yet galaxies experience further dynamical, morphological and chemical evolution. Understanding the relative role of internal drivers and of interaction with the evolving large-scale structures remains a highly complex and unsettled issue. To make transformative progress on these questions we must characterize the physical and kinematic properties (integrated and spatially resolved) of stellar populations in galaxies, fossil record of their past star formation and assembly histories, together with gas properties, across a wide range of masses and environmental scales, over this critical cosmic epoch. Volume-representative samples of 10^6 galaxies down to 10^9 solar masses are essential to fully trace the complex interplay between physical processes and to physically connect progenitor and descendant galaxy populations. This demands a deep and extensive survey with high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution, rest-frame optical spectroscopy. Current and planned facilities in the 2020-2030s cannot simultaneously achieve the required sample size, spectral quality, mass limit, and spatial coverage. A dedicated large-aperture spectroscopic facility with wide-area high-multiplex MOS and large field-of-view IFU is needed to provide transformative insights into the physical mechanisms regulating star formation and galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying Systematic Age Discrepancies in Very Young Star Clusters</a><span class="id">[2512.17033]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We infer the ages of three young stellar clusters, NGC 2004, NGC 7419, and NGC 2100, using Stellar Ages, a statistical algorithm designed to infer stellar population properties from color magnitude diagrams. Recent studies have revealed emerging inconsistencies in the inferred ages of very young stellar clusters with ages less than or equal to 50 Myr. Here, we identify and quantify two distinct discrepancies. First, we identify a systematic age offset of 0.55 plus minus 0.09 dex between red supergiant and bright blue star age estimates, equivalent to a factor of approximately 3.5 in linear age, with bright blue star ages appearing systematically younger than those inferred from red supergiants. Second, given the observed numbers of red supergiants and bright blue stars, we find a pronounced deficit of lower-mass main-sequence stars relative to expectations from a standard initial mass function. Although these discrepancies resemble those reported for intermediate-age clusters, their magnitude and character suggest that they are unique to the evolution of massive stars. Together, these results highlight population-level inconsistencies with single-star evolutionary models and underscore the need to consider multiple evolutionary tracers when age-dating young clusters. By combining individual stellar ages with population-wide constraints, our approach refines prior work on cluster age determinations and provides new insight into massive star evolution and the interpretation of cluster demographics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SHARP: Beyond JWST – Revealing the galaxy birth and growth with the resolution of the ELT</a><span class="id">[2512.17042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A deep understanding of the life-cycle of galaxies, particularly those of high mass, requires clarifying the mechanisms that regulate star formation (SF) and its abrupt shutdown (quenching), often capable of stopping SF rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. What initially triggers quenching, and what sustains the quiescent state thereafter, especially given the frequent presence of large gas reservoirs or even massive gas inflows, are unsolved key issues. Ultimately, the crucial connection between the galaxy life-cycle and the surrounding Intergalactic (IGM) and Circumgalactic (CGM) Medium remains largely unclear. Addressing these issues requires studying star formation, chemical enrichment, and quenching homogeneously up to high redshift. The upcoming AO-assisted Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), will deliver sharper and deeper data than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 mu) spectrograph designed to fully exploit the capabilities of ELT. Designed for multi-object slit spectroscopy and multi-Integral Field spectroscopy, SHARP points to achieve angular resolutions ( 30 mas) far superior to NIRSpec at JWST(100 mas) to decipher and reconstruct the life-cycle oa galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden Companions of the Early Milky Way I. New alpha-Enhanced Exoplanet Hosts</a><span class="id">[2512.17072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet formation in the chemically ancient, dynamically heated Galactic thick disc remains poorly constrained, owing to the expectation that its low solid reservoirs, short disc lifetimes, and harsh irradiation environments inhibit efficient assembly of planetary bodies. However, an increasing number of confirmed thick disc planet hosts now challenge this view, indicating that planetary formation and survival in the early Milky Way may have been more resilient – and more diverse – than standard disc-evolution models suggest. Here we present a homogeneous characterisation of 38 exoplanetary systems orbiting bona fide thick disc stars, combining new detections with a systematic reassessment of archival systems. High-precision radial velocities and space-based transit photometry, combined with uniform high-resolution spectroscopy, yield self-consistent stellar and planetary parameters, and thick disc membership is secured via joint chemical and kinematic criteria. Among these systems, we identify two remarkably low-density, inflated planets – TOI-1927 b and TOI-2643 b – representing the first puffy planets known to orbit thick disc stars, and an outcome that is highly unexpected in metal-poor environments, thereby challenging current models of atmospheric retention and thermal inflation at low metallicity. This consolidated sample establishes a new empirical baseline for understanding how planetary architectures emerge under the depleted, short-lived discs characteristic of the early Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A robust morphological classification method for galaxies using dual-encoding contrastive learning and multi-clustering voting on JWST/NIRCam images</a><span class="id">[2512.17162]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The two-step galaxy morphology classification framework {\tt USmorph} successfully combines unsupervised machine learning (UML) with supervised machine learning (SML) methods. To enhance the UML step, we employed a dual-encoder architecture (ConvNeXt and ViT) to effectively encode images, contrastive learning to accurately extract features, and principal component analysis to efficiently reduce dimensionality. Based on this improved framework, a sample of 46,176 galaxies at $0&lt;z&lt;4.2$, selected in the COSMOS-Web field, is classified into five types using the JWST near-infrared images: 33\% spherical (SPH), 25\% early-type disk (ETD), 25\% late-type disk (LTD), 7\% irregular (IRR), and 10\% unclassified (UNC) galaxies. We also performed parametric (S{é}rsic index, $n$,and effective radius, $r_{\rm e}$) and nonparametric measurements (Gini coefficient, $G$, the second-order moment of light, $M_{\rm 20}$, concentration, $C$, multiplicity, $\Psi$, and three other parameters from the MID statistics) for massive galaxies ($M_*&gt;10^9 M_\odot$) to verify the validity of our galaxy morphological classification system. The analysis of morphological parameters is consistent with our classification system: SPH and ETD galaxies with higher $n$, $G$, and $C$ tend to be more bulge-dominated and more compact compared with other types of galaxies. This demonstrates the reliability of this classification system, which will be useful for a forthcoming large-sky survey from the Chinese Space Station Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ODIN: A New Lyman Alpha Blob Selection Method, Sample, and Statistical Analysis at $z\sim3.1$</a><span class="id">[2512.17368]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ly$\alpha$ blobs (LABs) are large, spatially extended Ly$\alpha$-emitting objects whose nature remains unclear. Their statistical properties such as number densities and luminosity functions are still uncertain because of small sample sizes and large cosmic variance. The One-hundred-deg$^2$ DECam Imaging in Narrowbands (ODIN) survey, with its large volume, offers an opportunity to overcome these limitations. We describe our LAB selection method and present 112 new LABs in the 9 deg$^2$ E-COSMOS field. We begin with the conventional LAB selection approach, cross-matching LAEs with extended Ly$\alpha$ sources, yielding 89 LAB candidates. To obtain a more complete LAB sample, we introduce a new selection pipeline that models all galaxies detected in deep broadband imaging, subtracts them from the narrowband image, and then directly detects extended Ly$\alpha$ emission. This method successfully identifies 23 additional low-surface-brightness LABs which could otherwise be missed by the conventional method. The number density of ODIN LABs near an ODIN protocluster ($n=7.5\times10^{-5}$ cMpc$^{-3}$) is comparable to that found in the SSA22 proto-cluster and is four times higher than the average across the field. The cumulative Ly$\alpha$ luminosity function within the protocluster regions is similar to that measured for the LABs in the SSA22 proto-cluster, suggesting a large excess of luminous LABs relative to the average field. These findings suggest the Ly$\alpha$ luminosities and number densities of LABs are environment-dependent. ODIN will provide an expansive LAB and protocluster samples across six additional fields and two more redshifts, allowing us to investigate the nature of LABs in relation to their environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using a neural network approach and starspots dependent models to predict effective temperatures and ages of young stars</a><span class="id">[2512.17480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study presents a statistical approach to accurately predict the effective temperatures of pre-main sequence stars, which are necessary for determining stellar ages using the isochrone methodology and cutting-age starspots-dependent models. By training a Neural Network model on high-quality spectroscopic temperatures from the Gaia-ESO Survey as the response variable, and using photometric data from Gaia DR3 and 2MASS catalogs as explanatory variables, we implemented a methodology to accurately derive the effective temperatures of much larger populations of stars for which only photometric data are available. The model demonstrated robust performance for low-mass stars with temperatures below 7000 K, including young stars, the primary focus of this work. Predicted temperatures were employed to construct Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams and to predict stellar ages of different young clusters and star forming regions through isochrone interpolation, achieving excellent agreement with spectroscopic-based ages and literature values derived from model-independent methods like lithium equivalent widths. The inclusion of starspot evolutionary models improved the age predictions, providing a more accurate description of stellar properties. Additionally, the results regarding the effective temperature and age predictions of the young clusters provide evidence for intrinsic age spreads in the youngest clusters, suggesting multiple formation events over time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17486" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Competing Influence of Ram Pressure and Tidal Interaction in NGC 2276</a><span class="id">[2512.17486]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution of galaxies in groups is profoundly influenced by a variety of physical processes, with ram pressure and tidal interactions playing pivotal roles in shaping their structural and evolutionary pathways. The relative influence of these two processes is still debated in groups compared to clusters, as ram pressure is less understood there. We study NGC 2276, a nearby galaxy (z$\sim$0.0079) where the dominant process is still an open question. We examine the distribution of stellar populations in NGC 2276 using multiwavelength data to assess potential evidence of tidal interactions and ram-pressure stripping. We present the first HST WFC3/UVIS images of NGC 2276, and use them to investigate the distribution of stellar populations across the disk of NGC 2276, where we assume that the bluer broadband filters mainly trace younger stellar populations, while the redder filters trace mainly older stellar populations. Furthermore, by comparing HST images with maps of H$\alpha$ emission from Calar Alto's PMAS/PPAK integral field unit (IFU) and near-IR maps from Spitzer's IRAC, we identify arm-like overdensity features that trace the spiral structure of this galaxy and tracked the variation of their pitch angle with radius. Our results indicate that the distribution of the stellar populations is asymmetrical. The youngest stellar populations (up to $\sim$100 Myr) show higher concentration on the leading side of the galaxy and are more diffuse on the trailing side, consistent with gas compression due to ram-pressure. This asymmetry is visible in the red filters as well. We also show that the average pitch angles of the overdensity features increase with galactocentric distance. Our findings are consistent with the fact that ram pressure is the leading mechanism for the peculiar morphology of NGC 2276, but do not exclude the possibility that tidal interactions could have played a role.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observations of AGN-driven feedback: dynamics and ionization of the filaments in M87</a><span class="id">[2512.17563]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive kinematic and ionization analysis of the warm ionized filaments ($10^4$ K) in M87, the central galaxy of the Virgo cluster, using new integral field spectroscopy from MEGARA (GTC) and SITELLE (CFHT). MEGARA targets the southeastern (SE) filaments (3 kpc from the nucleus), coincident with the only known molecular gas clump, and the far eastern (FE) filament (15 kpc), spatially isolated within an old radio lobe. SITELLE fully maps the filaments, offering the first complete views of their kinematics and excitation. Combined with archival ALMA, MUSE and Chandra data, these observations offer a multi-phase view of gas dynamics. The filaments display complex motions inconsistent with simple rotation. Velocity structure functions (VSFs) of the warm and cold gas in the central and SE filaments show consistent steep slopes (2/3) and flattening on small scales of a few hundred parsecs, possibly suggesting energy injection from Type Ia supernovae, though interpretation is method-limited. The FE filament shows a lower VSF amplitude, suggesting less active driving. ALMA CO emission is co-spatial and kinematically aligned with the ionized gas, the latter showing broader velocity dispersions. Ionization diagnostics indicate AGN-related processes (e.g., shocks) dominate, with higher-energy excitation near the radio lobes and lower-energy fossil feedback signatures in the FE filament. Finally, the filaments follow the same strong H$\alpha$-X-ray surface brightness correlation seen in other clusters, supporting local thermal coupling between phases. However, the FE filament deviates from this trend, possibly due to uplift from past AGN outbursts or limitations in the analysis method.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Across the Universe: GW231123 as a magnified and diffracted black hole merger</a><span class="id">[2512.17631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GW231123 appears as the most massive binary black hole (BBH) ever observed by the LIGO interferometers with total mass $190-265 M_\odot$. A high observed mass can be explained by the combination of cosmological redshift and gravitational magnification if the source is aligned with a gravitational lens, such as a galaxy. Small-scale objects such as stars and remnants diffract the signal, distorting the wavefront and providing additional lensing signatures. Here we present an analysis of GW231123 combining for the first time the effects of diffraction by a small-scale lens and gravitational magnification by an external potential, modelled as an embedded point-mass lens (PL), finding an intriguing case for the lensing hypothesis. Lensing is favoured by the data, with a false alarm probability of the observed Bayes factors bounded below $&lt;1\%$, or $\sim 2.6 \sigma$ confidence level. Including lensing lowers the total source mass of GW231123 to $100-180 M_\odot$, closer to BBHs reported so far, and also removes discrepancies between different waveform approximants and the need for high component spins. We reconstruct all source and lens properties, including the microlens mass $190-850 M_\odot$, its offset, the magnitude of the external gravitational potential and its orientation. The embedded PL analysis leads to a lighter microlens compared to the isolated PL. Within our assumptions, the reconstruction is complete up to an ambiguity between the distance and projected density (mass-sheet degeneracy). Assuming a single galaxy as the macroscopic lens allows us to infer the total amplification of the signal, placing the event at redshift $0.7-2$, and predict the probability $~55\%$ of forming an additional detectable image due to strong lensing by the macrolens. We discuss the implications of our findings on the source and nature of the microlens, including a possible dark matter origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The contribution of the color space in LSST-like photometry for the selection of extragalactic globular cluster candidates</a><span class="id">[2512.17644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Globular clusters (GCs), densely packed collections of thousands to millions of old stars, are excellent tracers of their host galaxies' evolutionary histories. Traditional methods for identifying GCs in galaxies rely on cuts over photometric catalogs and can yield source lists with high levels of contamination from compact background galaxies and foreground stars. In an era when large-scale sky surveys produce photometry for millions of sources, it is essential to employ flexible and scalable tools to reliably identify GCs in external galaxies. To prepare for surveys like Rubin/LSST, we need to explore practical methodological improvements and quantify the limitations inherent in the datasets. This paper investigates the selection of point-like extragalactic GCs exclusively in the $ugrizY$ color space. We use archival data to assemble an LSST-like photometric catalog for the Fornax Cluster containing labeled spectroscopically confirmed GCs, galaxies, and stars. From this catalog, using principal component analysis and non-linear auto-encoders (AEs), we construct inputs to random forest and multi-layer perceptron classifiers. We show that selecting GCs using ugrizY colors can lead to contamination rates of   45%. If the principal components of the colors are used instead, this rate reduces to   35% without increasing incompleteness. The AEs did not improve GC identification. To further reduce contamination and extract the full potential of LSST for star cluster studies, we argue for the need to augment photometric information with ancillary data (morphology from space-based missions and near-infrared photometry) before attempting to leverage more complex models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The MeerKLASS L-band On-the-Fly Continuum Survey: Data Release 1</a><span class="id">[2512.17685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The MeerKAT Large Area Synoptic Survey (MeerKLASS) collaboration has acquired multiple passes of L-band (856-1712 MHz) scanning observations over a 268 deg$^2$ sky region. This scanning enables efficient, large-area sky surveys by continuously scanning the MeerKAT array back and forth at fixed elevation while recording data at 2 sec intervals, progressively covering the survey region as the Earth rotates. We employ a novel on-the-fly (OTF) interferometric imaging technique to construct continuum images and catalogs from 16 hours of scan data. These data products, constituting the first MeerKLASS L-band data release (DR1), consist of high-fidelity radio continuum images and a catalogue of 34,874 radio sources detected with a SNR$&gt;$9. The resulting Stokes I images achieve a median noise level of 33 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ and a median angular resolution of approximately $25.5''\times 7.8''$. Cross-comparisons with previous surveys confirm the consistency of our flux density scale within 5\% and astrometric precision within $1.5''$. Additionally, flux densities measured across the seven sub-bands enable in-band spectral-index estimates for the detected sources, providing insights into their physical properties and the broader source population. We compute the differential source counts, finding good agreement with existing measurements and validating our end-to-end processing. This data release demonstrates the effectiveness of scanning surveys when combined with OTF interferometric imaging. Commensal intensity mapping and interferometric imaging offers a dramatic enhancement of survey science per invested hour of observations and could therefore be an appealing option for next generation facilities like SKA-Mid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A VLA search for compact radio sources in the explosive molecular outflows DR 21 and G5.89</a><span class="id">[2512.17698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-angular-resolution ($\sim0\rlap{.}''1$) VLA Ku-band (12–18 GHz) observations of two explosive molecular outflows (EMOs), DR 21 and G5.89, in a search for runaway stars related to these explosive events. In DR 21, we identified 13 compact radio sources (CRS), 9 located in the DR 21 core and near the CO streamer ejection region. The radio properties of the CRSs show that three are nonthermal radio emitters, likely magnetically active stars, while the nature of the remaining CRSs cannot be conclusively identified. All detected CRSs are good candidates for follow-up proper motion studies to confirm whether they are runaway stars. We also identify multiple ionized arc-shaped structures that can be fitted with parabolas whose symmetry axes converge to a position coincident with CRSs #11, raising the possibility that this source is the main ionizing star. A re-analysis of the 18 molecular outflow streamers refines the center of the explosive event, which aligns closely with the position indicated by the arcs convergence point, supporting a common stellar origin for the EMOs and the HII-region. In G5.89, the observations reveal a shell with a square-like morphology. The strong extended emission from this HII region prevents the detection of weak compact radio sources inside the shell; only two were identified well beyond the shell, and a single parabolic arc was fitted within this region. Overall, arc structures in ionized regions seem to be good tracers of the origin of the ionizing sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interpreting the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies by halo spin bias</a><span class="id">[2512.17742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the IllustrisTNG300-ODM simulation to investigate the spin bias of low-mass halos and its connection to the strong clustering of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) reported by Zhang et al. (2025). By comparing two halo spin definitions-one using only bound particles ($\lambda_{\rm b}$) and another including unbound particles ($\lambda_{\rm a}$)-we demonstrate that the spin bias of low-mass halos critically depends on the definition. While $\lambda_{\rm a}$ yields stronger clustering for higher-spin halos at all masses, $\lambda_{\rm b}$ produces an inverted trend below $M_{\rm h}\sim 10^{11} \rm M_{\odot}/h$. This discrepancy is driven by a subset of halos in high-density environments that have large $\lambda_{\rm a}$ but small $\lambda_{\rm b}$. Using an empirical model implemented in SDSS-like mocks, we link the stellar surface-mass-density ($\Sigma_\ast$) of a galaxy to $\lambda_{\rm a}$ of its host halo and find an anti-correlation that more diffuse dwarfs tend to reside in higher-spin halos. The model naturally reproduces the observed strong clustering of UDGs within the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework without invoking exotic assumptions such as self-interacting dark matter. The high fraction of unbound particles in UDG hosts likely originates from tidal fields in dense regions, an effect particularly significant for low-mass halos. We discuss how the angular momentum of a halo represented by $\lambda_{\rm a}$ may be transferred to the gas to affect size and surface density of the galaxy that forms in the halo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic field spreading from stellar and galactic dynamos into the exterior</a><span class="id">[2512.17770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The exteriors of stellar and galactic dynamos are usually modeled as a current-free potential field. A more realistic description might be that of a force-free magnetic field. Here, we suggest that, in the absence of outflows, neither of those reflect the actual behavior when the magnetic field spreads diffusively into a more poorly conducting turbulent exterior outside dynamo. In particular, we show that the usual ordering of the dipole magnetic field being the most slowly decaying one is altered, and that the quadrupole can develop a toroidal component that decays even more slowly with radial distance. This behavior is best seen for spherical dynamo volumes and becomes more complicated for oblate ones. In either case, however, those fields are confined within a magnetosphere beyond which the field drops exponentially. The magnetosphere expands ballistically (i.e., linearly in time $t$) during the exponential growth phase of the dynamo, but diffusively proportional to $t^{1/2}$ during the saturated phase. We demonstrate that the Faraday displacement current, which plays a role in a vacuum, can safely be neglected in all cases. For quadrupolar configurations, the synchrotron emission from the magnetosphere is found to be constant along concentric rings. The total and the polarized radio emissions from the dipolar or the quadrupolar configurations display large scale radial trends that are potentially distinguishable with existing radio telescopes. The superposition of magnetic fields from galaxies in the outskirts of the voids between galaxy clusters can therefore not explain the void magnetization of the intergalactic medium, reinforcing the conventional expectation that those fields are of primordial origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the AGN variability timescale – black hole mass relationship with Gaia, SDSS and ZTF</a><span class="id">[2512.17811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit variability in their luminosities with timescales that correlate with the mass of the black hole at the centre of the AGN. Presently, the empirical correlation lacks sufficient precision to confidently convert these timescales into black hole masses, especially at the low-mass end. To find more AGNs with timescale measurements, we study a very large catalog of AGNs from the Gaia Data Release 3 called GLEAN (Gaia variabLE AgN; 872228 objects). We identify GLEAN objects with optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17 and light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) DR21. After fitting the light curves with a damped random walk model, we find that the GLEAN light curves have insufficient sampling to extract reliable amplitude and timescale measurements outside the range of 50-100 days. On the other hand, well-sampled ZTF light curves allow more accurate estimations of these parameters. The fractional variability amplitude is an effective, model-independent metric for measuring variability amplitude, but only when derived from high-quality light curves. We provide a catalog of 127 GLEAN AGNs with spectroscopic virial black hole masses, and variability amplitudes and timescales. Though we do not find any low-mass black holes in this AGN sample, we confirm a relationship between the damped random walk timescale and the black hole mass that is consistent with previous studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotic behaviour of galactic small-scale dynamos at modest magnetic Prandtl number</a><span class="id">[2512.17885]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields are critical at many scales to galactic dynamics and structure, including multiphase pressure balance, dust processing, and star formation. Dynamo action determines their dynamical structure and strength. Simulations of combined large- and small-scale dynamos have successfully developed mean fields with strength and topology consistent with observations but with turbulent fields much weaker than observed, while simulations of small-scale dynamos with parameters relevant to the interstellar medium yield turbulent fields an order of magnitude below the values observed or expected theoretically. We use the Pencil Code accelerated on GPUs with Astaroth to perform high-resolution simulations of a supernova-driven galactic dynamo including heating and cooling in a periodic domain. Our models show that the strength of the turbulent field produced by the small-scale dynamo approaches an asymptote at only modest magnetic Prandtl numbers. This allows us to use these models to suggest the essential characteristics of this constituent of the magnetic field for inclusion in global galactic models. The asymptotic limit occurs already at magnetic Prandtl number of only a few hundred, many orders of magnitude below physical values in the the interstellar medium and consistent with previous findings for isothermal compressible flows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Environment matters: stronger magnetic fields in satellite galaxies</a><span class="id">[2409.17229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the universe and an important component of the interstellar medium. It is crucial to accurately model and understand their properties in different environments and across all mass ranges of galaxies to interpret observables related to magnetic fields correctly. However, the assessment of the role of magnetic fields in galaxy evolution is often hampered by limited numerical resolution in cosmological simulations, in particular for satellite galaxies. To this end, we study the magnetic fields in high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of disk galaxies (with $M_{200}\approx10^{10}$ to $10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) and their satellites within the Auriga galaxy formation model including cosmic rays. We find significantly higher magnetic field strengths in satellite galaxies compared to isolated dwarfs with a similar mass or star-formation rate, in particular after they had their first close encounter with their host galaxy. These are stronger on average by factors of 2-8 when compared at the same total mass, with a large scatter, ranging up to factors of $\sim$15. While this result is ubiquitous and independent of resolution in the satellites that are past their first infall, there seems to be a wide range of amplification mechanisms acting together. Our result highlights the importance of considering the environment of dwarf galaxies when interpreting their magnetic field properties as well as related observables such as their gamma-ray and radio emission, the latter being particularly relevant for future observations such as with the SKA observatory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The structure and evolution of a high-mass stellar merger in the Hertzsprung gap</a><span class="id">[2505.05562]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Post-main-sequence binary mergers are a common evolutionary pathway for massive stars, but the effects of merging on the long-term structure and evolution of the resulting star are a matter of active debate.

We present the evolution of an 11 M$_\odot$ and 6.6 M$_\odot$ binary on an 11 day orbit, that merges while the primary is crossing the Hertzsprung gap. We construct the merger product either by rapidly accreting the secondary onto the surface of the primary or by injecting material from the secondary deeper into the primary via entropy sorting. We then evolve them to carbon ignition, comparing their interior structures at this stage. We find that all merger products experience an extended blue supergiant phase and have undermassive helium cores and low carbon mass fractions compared to single and stripped stars.

This work aims to use a numerical framework that is a close match to the observed large-scale distribution of stars and gas in the MW to isolate and understand the impact of galaxy-driven flows on the formation, agglomeration, and longevity of spiral patterns, prior to the inclusion of chemistry, star formation, and feedback. We use an isothermal simulation of a MW-like galaxy, found to closely match the longitude-velocity observational features of the MW in previous work, that includes the coupled evolution of gas, stars, and dark matter under purely gravitational and hydrodynamical processes. We characterise the morphology and kinematics of the stars and gas in the disc, quantify velocity residuals and their association with spiral features, and analyse the time-evolution of individual spiral-ridge segments. Our results demonstrate that our model reproduces many observed MW structural and kinematic signatures, from the inner Galaxy to the Solar neighbourhood, supporting its suitability as an analogue of the MW. The stellar spiral pattern in our model is relatively weak and shows lower multiplicity relative to the sharper gaseous arms, offering an explanation for discrepancies in observational determinations of the number and location of MW spiral arms. Both gas and stellar spiral arms are highly segmented, without a single coherent spiral pattern as expected from a grand-design type of galaxy.

For every accreted system in Auriga, we compute stellar masses and metallicities two ways: considering the total system (bound + lost material) and only considering the progenitor. Accreted systems in Auriga have a tight relation between total stellar mass and metallicity, with scatter at a fixed stellar mass driven by age. When only considering the progenitor, the tidally evolved mass-metallicity relation has similar scatter ($\sim$0.27 dex) as observed for the Local Group satellites ($\sim$0.23 dex). Satellites that lie above the relation have experienced substantial mass loss and typically have low metallicity for their total stellar mass. Even satellites that fall exactly on the evolved relation can lose over half of their stellar mass. Only satellites substantially below the evolved relation are reliably intact.

From these, robust detections of water gas emission at $2.7$-$2.8\,\mu$m and CO$_2$ gas at $4.23$-$4.27\,\mu$m plus tentative detections of $^{13}$CO$_2$ and CO gas were found. A slightly extended H$_2$O coma was detected, and a huge CO$_2$ atmosphere extending out to at least $4.2\times10^{5}\,$km was discovered. Gas production rates for H$_2$O, $^{12}$CO$_2$, $^{13}$CO$_2$, and CO were $Q_{\mathrm{gas}} = 3.2\times10^{26} \pm 20\%$, $1.6\times10^{27} \pm 10\%$, $1.3\times10^{25} \pm 25\%$, and $1.0\times10^{26} \pm 25\%$, respectively. Co-addition of all $\lambda = 1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m scattered light continuum images produced a high SNR image consistent with an unresolved source. The scattered light lightcurve showed $\lesssim 15\%$ variability over the observation period. The absolute brightness of 3I at $1.0$-$1.5\,\mu$m is consistent with a $&lt; 2.5\,$km radius nucleus surrounded by a 100 times brighter coma. The $1.5$-$4.0\,\mu$m continuum structure shows a strong feature commensurate with water ice absorption seen in KBOs and distant comets. The observed cometary behavior of 3I, including its preponderance of CO$_2$ emission, lack of CO output, small size, and predominance of large icy chunks of material in a flux-dominant coma is reminiscent of the behavior of short period comet 103P/Hartley 2, target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission in 2010 and a “hyperactive comet” near the end of its outgassing lifetime. This correspondence places 3I closer to barely- or non-active 1I/Oumuamua than primitive, ice rich 2I/Borisov, suggesting that ISOs are often highly thermally processed before ejection into the ISM.</p></div></details></article>

Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments.

For example, if one classifies a discontinuity as a density gradient larger than 0.02 kg m$^{-4}$, then most solutions should have at most one such discontinuity. Finally, we find that discontinuities, if present, are concentrated around a planetary normalised radius of 0.65 for Uranus and 0.7 for Neptune. Our algorithm to efficiently and faithfully investigate the full space of possible interior density profiles can be used to study all planetary objects with gravitational field data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SatTrack: Software for Evaluating Satellite Interference and Rim-Based Interference Mitigation Using a Reconfigurable Parabolic Antenna</a><span class="id">[2512.17016]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations (e.g., Starlink and Iridium) significantly increase the likelihood of transient, high-power interference events at ground receivers. This report presents SatTrack, a GUI-driven simulation framework that (i) tracks satellite motion relative to a fixed antenna boresight, (ii) predicts reflector gain patterns of a parabolic reflector antenna with a reconfigurable rim of specified size using a physical optics (PO) surface-current model decomposed into fixed and reconfigurable rim regions, and (iii) synthesizes deep, directional nulls using fast rim-weight optimization algorithms. Beyond baseline serial greedy and greedy bit-flip methods, additional files support advanced weight optimization algorithms including simulated annealing and majorization-minimization operating over higher-order complex weight alphabets, enabling deeper null formation. Interference power from satellites is estimated using free-space path loss and an FCC-derived Starlink EIRP versus steering-angle model, and event-level throughput for each satellite is computed using Shannon capacity. Results show simple binary rim control achieves about 40-55 dB of average interference suppression, while advanced optimization methods can exceed 65-70 dB under favorable geometries, with best-case received interference below -220 dBm. We compare no mitigation, satellite muting, and rim-based spatial nulling, showing rim-based nulling approaches muting-level suppression while preserving throughput close to the no-mitigation case. These results highlight both the scalability of rim-based reflector reconfiguration and the fundamental limitation when satellites cross the main lobe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exoplanets in reflected starlight with dual-field interferometry and a fifth Unit Telescope at VLTI</a><span class="id">[2512.17026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this white paper, we propose an upgrade to the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) consisting of the addition of a new 8m Unit Telescope (UT5).

However, many questions about their formation, evolution, and atmospheres remain unanswered. Phase curve observations can reveal answers to these questions by constraining multiple atmospheric properties including circulation, albedo, and chemistry. To this end, we simulate and forecast a survey of UHJ atmospheres via phase curve observations with the upcoming $\textit{Twinkle}$ mission. $\textit{Twinkle}$ is a spectroscopic satellite covering 0.5–4.5 micron with a spectral resolving power of R $\sim$ 50–70. Using a physically motivated model, we simulate white-light photometric phase curve observations for 14 UHJs in $\textit{Twinkle's}$ field of regard. We project that $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be able to detect all phase curve signals in our survey. Additionally, we simulate spectroscopic phase curves for the UHJ, WASP-189b. From our simulated spectroscopic phase curves, we generate mock phase-resolved emission spectra. Previously detected UHJ molecules (e.g. H$_2$O, CO and CO$_2$) produce notable features in the resulting spectra, allowing for detailed atmospheric characterization to study the 3D structure of UHJ atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. For planets with hotspot phase offsets, $\textit{Twinkle}$ will be capable of detecting them both in the optical and infrared wavelength ranges. This future survey would represent the first UHJ phase curve survey with simultaneous coverage in optical and infrared wavelengths and will provide new constraints and reveal intriguing trends in these extreme environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semantic Model for the SKA Regional Centre Network</a><span class="id">[2512.17305]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The unprecedented volume of data from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescopes will require the implementation of robust and solid strategies for efficient data processing and management. In this context, the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet) – a collaborative global infrastructure comprising multiple regional centres distributed across various geographical regions around the globe – is poised to play a critical role. This network will be instrumental in facilitating the effective handling and analysis of extensive data streams generated by the telescopes, thereby enabling significant advancements in astronomical research and exploration. This paper introduces a semantic model implemented with JSON-LD designed specifically for the SRCNet, detailing its architecture, data distribution, and computing service. By explicitly defining nodes, resources, relationships, and workflows, this model lays a foundation for interoperability and efficient resource management within the distributed network. The model presented in this text supports two possible configurations: centralized and decentralized – depending where data reside – enabling a future service broker to efficiently plan workflows by querying nodes for real-time system availability. Consistency tests conducted using SPARQL queries were made on the model in order to validate and test its integrity. Therefore, this research contributes to the advancement of semantic modeling in astronomy by addressing the semantic model for the SRCNet, a topic that has not been previously explored. This semantic model serves as a precursor to the development of a precise mathematical representation of the network and establishes a foundational framework for a future service broker.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESO Expanding Horizons: Underluminous Thermonuclear Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2512.17404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Underluminous Thermonuclear Supernovae (uTSNe) are an emerging class of transient events that resemble classic Supernovae Type Ia, but peak at much lower luminosities.

The ability to detect and study uTSNe is limited by the lack of high spatial resolution (&lt;0.1&quot;), wide-field (&gt;10'x10') imaging capabilities in the optical, as well as large-scale segmented-telescope spectroscopic abilities that allow highly dynamic time-critical spectroscopy of short-duration transient events.

Astrophys., 667, 48, 2022) argued and made a compelling case that classical astronomical adaptive optics (AO) tomography performance can be further enhanced by carefully designing and optically configuring the system to leverage inherent super-resolution (SR) capabilities. Our goal here is to further materialise the concept by providing the means to compute SR-enabling tomographic reconstructors for AO and showcase its broad uptake on soon every 10 m-class VIS/NIR telescopes and Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes of up to 40 m in diameter. To that end we indicate the necessary tomography generalisations where we: (i) clarify how model-and-deploy is a generic methodological umbrella for linear minimum-mean-squared-error (LMMSE) tomographic reconstructors arising naturally from the solution of the tomographic inverse problem, thus unifying various solutions presented as distinct in the literature within a single framework, (ii) recall how such solutions are found as limiting cases of a model-based optimal control problem, thus elucidating how pseudo-open-loop control is a feature of the latter that allows LMMSE reconstructors to be adapted to closed-loop systems, (iii) review the two forms of the LMMSE tomographic reconstructors, highlighting the necessary adaptations to accommodate super-resolution, (iv) review the implementation in either dense-format vector-matrix-multiplication or sparse iterative forms and (v) discuss the implications for runtime and off-line real-time implementations, anticipating widespread adoption. We illustrate our examples with physical-optics numerical simulations for 10 m and 40 m-scale systems showing the performance benefits of super-resolution in the order of several tens of nm rms and the computational burden associated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17469" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super-resolution wavefront reconstruction in adaptive-optics with pyramid sensors</a><span class="id">[2512.17469]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Super-resolution (SR) refers to a combination of optical design and signal processing techniques jointly employed to obtain reconstructed wave-fronts at a higher-resolution from multiple low-resolution samples, overcoming the intrinsic limitations of the latter. After compelling examples have been provided on multi-Shack-Hartman (SH) wave-front sensor (WFS) adaptive optics systems performing atmospheric tomography with laser guide star probes, we broaden the SR concept to pyramid sensors (PyWFS) with a single sensor and a natural guide star. We revisit the analytic PyWFS diffraction model to claim two aspects: i) that we can reconstruct spatial frequencies beyond the natural Shannon-Nyquist frequency imposed by the detector pixel size and/or ii) that the PyWFS can be used to measure amplitude aberrations (at the origin of scintillation). SR offers the possibility to control a higher actuator density deformable mirror from seemingly fewer samples, the quantification of which is one of the goals of this paper. A super-resolved PyWFS is more resilient to mis-registration, lifts alignment requirements and improves performance (against aliasing and other spurious modes AO systems are poorly sensitive to) with only a factor up to 2 increased real-time computational burden.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLiENT: A new tool for emulating cosmological likelihoods using deep neural networks</a><span class="id">[2512.17509]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological emulation of observables such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectra and matter power spectra have become increasingly common in recent years because of the potential for saving computation time in connection with cosmological parameter inference or model comparison. In this paper we present CLiENT (Cosmological Likelihood Emulator using Neural networks with TensorFlow), a new method which circumvents the computation of observables in favour of directly emulating the likelihood function for a data set given a model parameter vector. We find that the method is competitive with observable emulators in terms of the required number of function evaluations, but has the distinct advantage of producing a surrogate likelihood which is completely auto-differentiable. Using less than $2 \times 10^4$ function evaluations CLiENT typically achieves credible intervals within better than $0.1 \sigma$ of those obtained using the true likelihood and single-point emulator precision better than $\Delta \chi^2 \sim 0.5$ across relevant regions in parameter space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surrogate-Accelerated Bayesian Inversion for Exoplanet Interior Characterization</a><span class="id">[2512.17626]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing the interior structure of exoplanets is an inverse problem often solved using Bayesian inference, but this approach is hampered by the high computational cost of planetary structure models. To overcome this barrier, we present a robust framework that accelerates inference by replacing the computationally expensive physics-based forward model with a fast polynomial chaos-Kriging (PCK) surrogate directly within a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling loop. We rigorously validate our approach using a suite of tests, including a direct comparison against a benchmark MCMC inference using the full forward model, and a large-scale coverage study with 1000 synthetic test cases to demonstrate the statistical reliability of our inferred credible intervals. Our surrogate-assisted framework achieves a computational speedup of over 2 orders of magnitude (factor of $\sim$320), reducing single-CPU inference times from days to minutes. This efficiency is achieved with a surrogate that requires only a few hundred forward model evaluations for training \rev{for a single planet}. This data efficiency provides significant flexibility for model developments and a clear advantage over common machine learning approaches, which typically demand vast training sets ($&gt;10^6$ model runs) and intensive pre-computation. The PCK surrogate maintains high fidelity with $R^2 &gt; 0.99$ for most scenarios, and root-mean-square errors typically an order of magnitude smaller than observational uncertainties. This efficiency enables large scale population studies while preserving statistical robustness, which is computationally impractical with traditional methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Systematic search of laser and phase modulation noise coupling in heterodyne interferometry</a><span class="id">[2512.17802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Heterodyne interferometry for precision science often comes with an optical phase modulation, for example, for intersatellite clock noise transfer for gravitational wave (GW) detectors in space, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The phase modulation potentially causes various noise couplings to the final phase extraction of heterodyne beatnotes by a phasemeter. In this paper, in the format of space-based GW detectors, we establish an analytical framework to systematically search for the coupling of various noises from the heterodyne and modulation frequency bands, which are relatively unexplored so far. In addition to the noise caused by the phase modulation, the high-frequency laser phase noise is also discussed in the same framework. The analytical result is also compared with a numerical experiment to confirm that our framework successfully captures the major noise couplings. We also demonstrate a use case of this study by taking the LISA-like parameters as an example, which enables us to derive requirements on the level of the laser and phase modulation noises in the high frequency regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17204" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Search for Binary Black Hole Mergers in LIGO O1-O3 Data with Convolutional Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2512.17204]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since the first detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by LIGO from the binary black hole merger GW150914, gravitational wave astronomy has developed significantly, with over 200 compact binary merger events cataloged. The use of neural networks has the potential to significantly speed up the detection, classification, and especially parameter estimation for gravitational wave events, compared to current techniques, quite important for electromagnetic follow-up of events. In this work, we present a machine learning pipeline using neural networks to detect gravitational wave events. We generate training data using real LIGO data to train and refine neural networks that can detect binary black hole (BBH) mergers, and apply these models to search through LIGO's first three observing runs. We detect 57 out of the 75 total cataloged BBH events with two detectors of data in O1, O2, and O3, with 57 false positives that can mostly be ruled out with parameter inference and human inspection. Finally, we extensively test this pipeline on time-shifted data to characterize its False Alarm Rate (FAR). These results are an important step in developing machine learning-based GW searches, enabling low-latency detection and multi-messenger astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In situ substrate birefringence characterization in gravitational wave detectors using a heterodyne polarimetry method</a><span class="id">[2512.17395]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-quality test mass substrates play essential roles in laser interferometric gravitational wave detectors.

Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types–LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP–followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.

From this we estimate a total data volume of 238 TB for the full three year mission, or 70 TB after Huffman compression. We further estimate the running time for one Gibbs sample, from TOD to cosmological parameters, to be approximately 3000 CPU hours. The current simulations are based on an ideal instrument model, only including correlated 1/f noise. Future work will consider realistic systematics with full end-to-end error propagation.
