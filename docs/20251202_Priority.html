Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations, we study the evolution of isolated halos in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) with massive PCs embedded at their centers, a scenario that could be realized in certain SIDM models with light mediators that predict a small-scale suppression of the linear matter power spectrum. We track the evolution of three equally concentrated $10^7\,{\rm{M}}_\odot$ halos, hosting PCs of various total masses, and quantify how the presence of a PC affects the processes of core formation and collapse. Early in the core-formation phase, halos with more prominent PCs exhibit a delayed evolution by a factor of $\sim 2$ due to smaller velocity dispersion gradients in the inner region. During most of the core-collapse phase, the halo evolution becomes closely aligned in physical time, with appropriate rescaling of densities, radii, and velocity dispersions. The scale densities and radii preserve the virial mass of the original halos, but with increased concentration. Deviations occur at the late phase of core-collapse at the level of $\sim 5\%$ relative to the reference collapse track of an NFW halo. These deviations depend non-trivially on both the increased concentration incurred by the PCs, as well as the velocity dispersion (temperature) of the outer halo regions, which can inhibit or enhance the heat transfer process. Our simulations illustrate the complex interplay between the inner and outer halo profiles in determining the onset of core collapse and motivate future studies in the full cosmological context.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA Survey of 70 μm Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XIII. Core Mass Function, Lifetime, and Growth of Prestellar Cores</a><span class="id">[2512.00147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The core mass function (CMF) of prestellar cores is essential for understanding the initial conditions of star and cluster formation. However, the universality of the CMF and its relationship to the initial mass function (IMF) remain unclear. We study the CMF in the earliest stage of high-mass star formation using 461 prestellar core candidates and 254 protostellar cores as a part of the ALMA Survey of 70 \mu m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). We find that prestellar core candidates tend to have lower masses than protostellar cores. We also find that the lifetime of prestellar cores is several times longer than the freefall time, although it approaches the freefall time as the core mass increases. The CMF, including both protostellar and prestellar cores, has a power-law slope of $-2.05\pm0.04$, shallower than Salpeter's IMF slope of -2.35. Conversely, the CMF of gravitationally bound, prestellar cores has a steeper slope ($-2.32\pm0.30$), indistinguishable from Salpeter's slope. This finding is consistent with observations in both low-mass star-forming regions and high-mass protoclusters, implying a universal core formation mechanism. The protostellar CMF with a larger maximum core mass can be reproduced by the prestellar CMF when an external gas infall is considered. The inferred mass infall rate is higher than the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion rate and follows a shallower mass dependence (smaller power-law index), more consistent with the tidal-lobe accretion. This may contribute to the evolution of CMFs seen in later stages.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DREAMS Project: A New Suite of 1,024 Simulations to Contextualize the Milky Way and Assess Physics Uncertainties</a><span class="id">[2512.00148]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a new suite of 1,024 cosmological and hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass halos, run with Cold Dark Matter, as part of the DREAMS Project. Each simulation in the suite has a unique set of initial conditions and combination of cosmological and astrophysical parameters. The suite is designed to quantify theoretical uncertainties from halo-to-halo variance, as well as stellar and black hole feedback. We develop a novel weighting scheme that prioritizes regions of the input parameter space, yielding galaxies consistent with the observed present-day stellar mass–halo mass relation. The resulting galaxy population exhibits a wide diversity in structural properties that encompasses those of the actual Milky Way, providing a powerful statistical sample for galactic archaeology. To demonstrate the suite's scientific utility, we investigate the connection between a galaxy's merger history, focusing on Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) analogs, and its present-day properties. We find that galaxies with a GSE analog have lower star formation rates, more compact disks, and more spherical stellar halos. Crucially, significant halo-to-halo scatter remains, demonstrating that matching more than the most significant events in the Milky Way's past is necessary to recover its present-day properties. Our results highlight the necessity for large statistical samples to disentangle the stochastic nature of galaxy formation and robustly model the Milky Way's unique history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00151" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Episodic Star Formation – I. Overview and Scatter of the Star-Forming Main Sequence</a><span class="id">[2512.00151]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Episodic star formation cycles in both high- and low-redshift galaxies have gained more and more evidence. This paper aims to understand the detailed physical processes behind such behaviors and investigate how such an episodic star-forming scenario can explain the scatter in star-formation rate (SFR) of star-forming main-sequence galaxies. This is achieved through tracing back in time the history of z=0 star-forming central galaxies in the TNG100 simulation over the past 7-8 Gyrs. As the first paper in this series, we provide an overview of the episodic star formation history. We find that two branches of star formation typically develop during each episode: while one branch happens in heavily metal-enriched gas in the centers of galaxies, a secondary branch starts in lower-metallicity regions at galaxy outskirts where fresh gas first arrives, and gradually progresses to inner regions of galaxies. Additionally, the temporal variation in the SFR at galaxy outskirts is more significant than that at centers. As a consequence, the metallicities in both gas and young stars exhibit remarkably different distributions between SFR peaks and valleys. The resulting temporal SFR fluctuation within individual galaxies has an average of   0.2 dex, while the intrinsic differentiation between (the historical mean of) galaxies is   0.15 dex. These two together can well account for the scatter in SFR of   0.25 dex as observed for z=0 star-forming main-sequence galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CECILIA: The Mass-Metallicity Relation of Low-Mass Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</a><span class="id">[2512.00162]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A galaxy's metallicity and its relation to stellar mass encode the history of gas accretion, star formation, and outflows within cosmic ecosystems. We present new constraints on the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at $z\sim2-3$ from ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of seven continuum-faint galaxies in the Chemical Evolution Constrained using Ionized Lines in Interstellar Aurorae (CECILIA) Faint sample (Raptis et al. 2025). Our sample includes Ly$\alpha$-selected and other low-luminosity star-forming galaxies with stellar masses $\log(M_\star / M_\odot)\sim7.2-9.7$ and moderately faint rest-UV magnitudes ($-20.7 \lesssim M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -17.3$). Gas-phase oxygen abundances, calculated using empirical calibrations of [O III]/H$\beta$ together with [N II]/H$\alpha$ constraints, span $\sim0.04-0.5$ $Z_\odot$. We measure a steep MZR slope of $\gamma = 0.48 \pm 0.11$, suggesting a rapid increase in metal retention efficiency with mass, consistent with energy-driven outflows. Comparison with lower- and higher-redshift studies indicates an evolution in normalization from $z\sim0$ to $z\sim2$, reflecting less metal enrichment in early galaxies. We find no significant evolution in the MZR between $z\sim2$ and the Epoch of Reionization, suggesting that our galaxies may serve as useful analogs of reionization-era systems. Expanded samples and direct $T_e$-based abundance measurements will be crucial to fully trace the build-up of metals in low-mass galaxies during the peak epoch of cosmic star formation and to test the reliability of strong-line calibrations in these galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recoiling Black Hole Candidates from Spatially Offset Broad Emission Lines in MaNGA</a><span class="id">[2512.00174]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we identify 14 off-nuclear broad (FWHM&gt;1000 km/s) Halpha and/or Hbeta emission line sources that indicate spatially offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates. In addition to massive black holes (MBHs) in on-going galaxy mergers, this selection can also find MBHs that have been ejected from the host galaxy nucleus due to MBH binary coalescence and asymmetric gravitational wave emission or the dynamical `slingshot' mechanism. Recoiling/slingshot MBHs are predicted to affect co-evolution between MBHs and their host galaxies, and they are observational tracers of past binary MBH mergers and gravitational wave emission. This is the first systematic search through an integral field spectroscopy survey for ejected MBHs to enable uniform constraints on their surface densities. We find that 42% (6/14) have optical image counterparts consistent with galaxy stellar cores from infalling MBHs before the close binary MBH stage. The remaining 58% (8/14) have large broad line luminosities relative to their stellar core mass upper limits ( 2 times larger than for central AGN), suggesting merger-driven MBH accretion enhancements or potentially ejected MBHs. The signatures of AGN-ionized narrow emission lines for recoil/slingshot candidates are weaker by 68%, which is consistent with the ejected MBH scenario. The broad line projected velocity offsets range from  10-600 km/s and suggest motion within the host galaxy potentials. Finally, the implied recoiling MBH surface density upper limit is consistent with predictions that assume random spin orientations in MBH binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The sonic scale does not determine the core separation in turbulent molecular clouds</a><span class="id">[2512.00284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has recently been suggested that the typical separation between cores in molecular clouds dominated by turbulence is determined by the sonic scale, the size scale at which the turbulent velocity dispersion equals the sound speed. In this work, we test this hypothesis using a suite of turbulent simulations with Mach numbers $\mathcal{M}=4$ and 8, and three turbulent forcing wavenumbers ($k_{\rm for}=2,4$ and 8). Dense cores are identified through dendrogram analysis of column density maps, and their separations are compared to the sonic scale measured from velocity structure functions. We find no statistical correlation between the core separation and the sonic scale nor with the driving scale. Instead, for each run, the core separation spans the entire range of values between these two scales. Our results indicate that fragmentation in turbulence-dominated clouds is not governed by an intrinsic scale in the turbulent cascade. This finding calls into question the use of the sonic scale as a predictive quantity in star formation theories and cautions against interpreting observational core spacings as evidence for universal turbulent fragmentation physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A tale of three tails: A misaligned streamer and mysterious structures around [BHB2007]1</a><span class="id">[2512.00295]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent discoveries of streamer-like structures around protostellar sources challenge the traditional picture of isolated, axisymmetric star formation. Here, we present new ALMA observations of [BHB2007]1, a flat-spectrum source connected to at least three such elongated structures. Two of these features are symmetrically located to the north and south of the disk, with velocities aligned with the disk on their respective sides. However, their unbound kinematics and curved morphology make it difficult to determine their origin. Possible explanations include outflows, interactions with the nearby BHB2 system, and hyperbolic infall, but none fully account for all observed properties. In contrast, a newly identified collimated structure to the west shows clear evidence of gravitationally bound infall. Estimates of its mass, mass infall rate, and angular momentum suggest that this infalling streamer would roughly double the mass budget available to form planets and tilt the disk by a few tens of degrees. Furthermore, its misalignment with the midplane of the disk and the lack of diffuse envelope emission indicate that the streamer may have formed due to gravitational capture of cloud material unrelated to the source's natal core. Together, these findings support a more dynamic picture of star formation, one where environmental interactions continue to shape conditions for building planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Excitation of molecular hydrogen by cosmic-ray protons</a><span class="id">[2512.00474]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low-energy cosmic rays ($E\lesssim 1$ GeV) are responsible for the ionisation and heating of molecular clouds. While the role of supra-thermal electrons produced in the ionisation process in inducing excitation of the ambient gas (mostly molecular hydrogen) has been studied in detail, the role of primary cosmic-ray nuclei (protons and heavier nuclei) has been generally neglected. Here, we introduce, for the first time, cross sections for proton impact on H$_2$, calculated using the semi-classical implementation of the molecular convergent close-coupling method. Our findings show that proton-induced H$_2$ excitation is comparable in magnitude to that caused by electrons. We discuss the possible implications on the estimate of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from observations in the near-infrared domain and on the cosmic-ray-induced H$_2$ ultraviolet luminescence. We also derive a new approximated analytical parameterisation of the spectrum of secondary electrons that can be easily incorporated in numerical codes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquity of Methanol and its related Chemical Segregation in Orion Starless Cores: the ALMASOP Sample</a><span class="id">[2512.00498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complex organic molecules (COMs) in starless cores provide critical insights into the early stages of star formation and prebiotic chemistry. We present a chemical survey of 16 starless cores (including five prestellar cores) in the Orion A and B molecular clouds, targeting CH3OH, N2H+, CCS, and c-C3HD, using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) and the Yebes 40-m telescope. CH3OH was detected toward all targets, confirming its ubiquity in starless cores, consistent with previous surveys in Taurus and Perseus. ACA imaging shows that CH3OH, CCS, and c-C3HD generally trace the outer layers of the dense cores outlined by N2H+, each exhibiting distinct spatial distributions. Meanwhile, Comparison with Yebes data reveals an extended, flattened CH3OH component. CCS and c-C3HD tend to be detected or non-detected together across cores, while cores near dust-rich regions on a large scale often lack both, suggesting environmental influences linked to the interstellar radiation field. Within individual cores, CCS typically resides in an outer layer relative to c-C3HD. Our findings underscore the importance of high-resolution studies for understanding the origins and spatial differentiation of COMs and carbon-chain molecules in cold, quiescent environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: A comprehensive X-ray analysis of the Hydra I galaxy cluster</a><span class="id">[2512.00518]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hydra I galaxy cluster (Abell 1060) is a nearby example of a low-temperature cluster that exhibits intermediate cool core and non-cool core properties. We aim to extend the characterization of the intracluster medium (ICM) properties at least until $R_{200}$ and study the correlation between the X-ray emission and non-thermal emission within $R=0.15$$R_{500}$, and optical/IR galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. We used data from the first four SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Surveys and an archival Chandra observation to image the X-ray emission from Abell 1060. We also used multiwavelength data from TGSS (radio), 2MASS (IR), and NED (optical) to investigate the non-thermal emission, 2D galaxy distribution, and its redshift evolution, respectively. The surface brightness and spectral analyses are also extended until 3$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$, respectively, following a detailed cosmic X-ray background (CXB) analysis. Our fully corrected eROSITA image showcases a relaxed ICM morphology within $R_{500}$. We detect two weak ICM shocks with Mach number $M\approx 1.5$ near the central galaxy NGC 3311 that coincide with diffuse radio emission along the line of sight. Furthermore, we detect multiple soft X-ray excesses with high spatial correlation with the 2D optical galaxy distribution beyond $R_{200}$. In particular, the excess in the north has a significance of $5.8\sigma$ above the local CXB level. This suggests that Abell 1060's outskirts are actively accreting baryons. We also estimate the average ICM temperature and metallicity of $\langle k_\mathrm{B}T \rangle=2.27\substack{+0.15\\-0.11}\thinspace$ keV and $\langle Z\rangle=0.19\substack{+0.05\\-0.03}\thinspace Z_\odot$, respectively, from the 0.2-0.5$R_{500}$ annulus. Overall, the temperature profile is broadly consistent with the average temperature profiles from hydrodynamical simulation and Suzaku between 0.28$R_{200}$ and $R_{200}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar Ices as Carriers of Supernova Material to the Early Solar System</a><span class="id">[2512.00522]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary materials show systematic variations in their nucleosynthetic isotope compositions that resonate with orbital distance. The origin of this pattern remains debated, limiting how these isotopic signatures can be used to trace the precursors of terrestrial planets. Here we test the hypothesis that interstellar ices carried supernova-produced nuclides by searching for a supernova nucleosynthetic fingerprint in aqueous alteration minerals from carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. We focus on zirconium, a refractory element that includes the neutron-rich isotope $^{96}$Zr formed in core-collapse supernovae. Leaching experiments reveal extreme $^{96}$Zr enrichments in alteration minerals, showing that they incorporated supernova material hosted in interstellar ices. We show that the Solar System's zirconium isotope variability reflects mixing between these ices and an ice-free rocky component. Finally, the presence of supernova nuclides in a volatile carrier supports models where the Solar System's nucleosynthetic variability was imparted by thermal processing of material in the protoplanetary disk and during planetary accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniformly-calibrated VPHAS+ photometry in the third quadrant of the Galactic plane</a><span class="id">[2512.00650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The southern Galactic plane has been mapped at optical wavelengths and at under one-arcsecond angular resolution by the VST Photometric Ha Survey of the Galactic plane and bulge (VPHAS+). Anticipating the release of a uniform photometric calibration of the entire survey, we examine the properties of VPHAS+ ugriHa photometry of r &lt; 19 mag. point sources in the third Galactic quadrant (longitudes 210^o to 260^o). We compare our interim calibration in gri with that of Pan-STARRS, the DECam Plane Survey (DECaPS-2) and Skymapper. We use the comparisons to identify small gri photometric offsets. Corrections to the Ha and u magnitude scales are determined via comparison with synthetic photometry. VPHAS+ and its northern counterpart, the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS), are shown to closely align, where they overlap across the celestial equator. Aided by Gaia Data Release 3, SIMBAD, and specialist catalogues, we present selections of: A stars; sub-luminous stars; intrinsically-red luminous stars; young stellar objects; emission-line and OB stars. Attention is drawn to stellar variability as a contaminant in selecting emission line objects via (r - Ha) excess. It is argued the (r - i, r - Ha) plane is the better choice for this selection than (g - i, r - Ha). Using A stars to map extinction, we trace the main run of dust obscuration, situated at mainly negative Galactic latitudes. Like the dust, OB and emission line stars are more frequent below the Galactic equator: at heliocentric distances of up to  7 kpc, these stars' distribution fit in with the known warping of the Galactic plane. An overdensity of B stars, several degrees across and potentially in the Outer Arm, is found around (l,b) = (212.0, -0.6).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for the Faint-End Suppression in the z = 6 $\sim$ 8 UV Luminosity Function: A Lensing Analysis of Abell 2744</a><span class="id">[2512.00730]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We determine the $z=6-8$ ultraviolet (UV) LF in the JWST UNCOVER field behind Abell 2744, through a depth-tied completeness model and source-plane selection taking multiple images into account.

When fitting each lens model independently with both the original and turnover-extended form (while keeping $M^*=-20.5$), we obtain decisive model selection in favour of a faint-end turnover. The peak of the turnover posteriors is at $\alpha \simeq -1$, $\beta \simeq 1.6$, and drive $M_T$ to the high side of our prior ($\sim -18$) and the difference in normalization between CATS-GLAFIC is absorbed into $\phi^*$. A similar magnification-bias test in the image plane gives a $B(\mu)$ trend matching to what is expected, which provides an internal consistency of our selection and volumes. Our results indicate an early suppression of the UV LF at $z=6-8$, and carry implications for the ionizing contribution of ultra-faint systems during reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadband Spectral Analysis of 1ES2344+514: A Multi-epoch study</a><span class="id">[2512.00750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of the multi-epoch broadband spectral study of 1ES 2344+514 and study the evolution of physical parameters.

During 2017 July, 1ES 2344+514 appeared to be in the highest flaring state compared to other periods. We used the 0.5 – 7.0 keV and 3.0 – 20.0 keV data, respectively, from SXT and LAXPC of AstroSat and also 0.3 – 8.0 keV and 3.0 – 79.0 keV data, respectively, from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. A joint fit between SXT and LAXPC, and between Swift-XRT and NuSTAR has been done for constraining the synchrotron peak. A clear shift in the synchrotron peak has been observed, which included 1ES 2344+514 in the HSP BL Lac family. A `harder-when-brighter' trend is observed in X-rays, and the opposite trend, i.e., `softer-when-brighter', is seen in the $\gamma$-rays. The multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this source were built and studied to get an idea of the radiation processes. The SEDs were fitted using a steady-state leptonic one-zone synchrotron+SSC model, and the fitted parameters of the emission region are consistent with those of other TeV BL Lacs.

Non-parametric tests suggest that only a small fraction of the double systems ($\lesssim13$ per cent) are comprised of sources with compatible redshifts, while 47-67 per cent of triple and quadruple fields contain at least one potentially associated pair. Simulations using a mock catalogue of dusty star-forming galaxies suggest that 32 per cent of the double systems are likely physically associated ($\Delta z &lt; 0.01$, i.e. $\lesssim$10 comoving Mpc at $z = 3$) and, while only 8 per cent of the triple and none of the quadruple systems meet this criterion, $\sim$ 70 per cent of them include at least one likely associated pair. Our results suggest that enhanced star formation rates in submillimetre galaxies are primarily driven by internal processes rather than large-scale interactions. This study also provides a catalog of potential overdensities for follow-up observations, offering insights into proto-cluster formation and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Correlation between Dark Matter Content, Ages and Mass-to-Light Ratios in Spiral Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2512.00823]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an empirical investigation into the relationship between galactic age and dark matter content across a sample of 16 nearby, well-resolved spiral galaxies. Using raw rotation curve data from IOA Tokyo's publicly available repository, we model each galaxy's mass distribution via a three-component decomposition (Hernquist bulge, exponential disk, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo) fit using Monte Carlo simulations. The onset of dark matter dominance was identified using the NFW scale radius, beyond which we computed the total enclosed mass via Keplerian dynamics. I-band luminosities for these regions were estimated using a calibrated Tully-Fisher relation, yielding precise mass-to-light (M/L) ratios. We further calculated dark matter mass and density using NFW profile equations, and galaxy ages were retrieved through an extensive literature survey of stellar population studies. Our analysis reveals strong positive correlations between galactic age and both dark matter mass (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $\rho \approx 0.93$) and density (Pearson $r \approx 0.91$; Spearman $\rho \approx 0.91$), as well as M/L ratios, suggesting a robust link between evolutionary history and dark matter build-up. These findings are in quantitative agreement with predictions from large-scale cosmological simulations that incorporate assembly bias and smooth accretion-dominated growth, reinforcing the view that older galaxies, having formed earlier in high-density peaks, have accumulated significantly more dark matter over cosmic time. Our results offer observational evidence for time-dependent dark matter assembly and establish galactic age as a meaningful tracer of halo evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible quasi-periodic optical oscillations of ZTF blazars</a><span class="id">[2512.00871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we selected 10 blazars as our sample sources.

We conducted a detailed analysis of their optical light curves (g- and r-bands) over the past five years using the root mean square (RMS)-Flux relation, flux distribution, and QPO detection methods to investigate their variability characteristics. A linear RMS-Flux relation is present in both bands, and their flux distributions follow a log-normal form. This suggests that optical variability may arise from multiplicative, nonlinear processes across different timescales and flux states. Further QPO analysis using the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods identified candidate periodic signals in four blazars. J 0923.5+4125 (period $\sim$ 205 days) and J 1221.3+3010 ($\sim$ 630 days) show local significances of $\sim 3 \sigma$, whereas J 1503.5+4759 ($\sim$ 38.5 days) and J 1652.7+4024 ($\sim$ 48 days) reach $\sim 4 \sigma$. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the global significances for J 1503.5+4759 in the g- and r-bands are $\sim 2.7 \sigma$, while for J 1652.7+4024 they are approximately $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ in both bands. These two blazars warrant further monitoring and investigation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OzDES Reverberation Mapping Program: CIV lags from six years of data</a><span class="id">[2512.01260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present 29 successfully recovered CIV time lags in Active Galactic Nuclei from the complete Dark Energy Survey Reverberation Mapping campaign.

Here we present the final review and analysis of this OzDES reverberation mapping campaign. These observations use 6-7 years of photometric and spectroscopic observations of 735 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) in the redshift range $z\in [0.13, 3.85]$ and bolometric luminosity range $\log_{10}(L_{\mathrm{bol}})\in [44.3, 47.5] \mathrm{erg/s}$. Both photometry and spectra are observed in visible wavelengths, allowing for the physical scale of the AGN broad line region to be estimated from reverberations of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emission lines. We successfully use reverberation mapping to constrain the masses of 62 super-massive black holes, and combine with existing data to fit a power law to the lag-luminosity relation for the Hbeta and MgII lines with a scatter of $\sim0.25$ dex, the tightest and most robust fit yet identified. We fit a similarly constrained relation for CIV, resolving a tension with the low luminosity literature AGN by accounting for selection effects. We also examine the impact of emission line width and luminosity (related to accretion rate) in reducing the scatter of these scaling relationships and find no significant improvement over the lag-only approach for any of the three lines. Using these relations, we further estimate the masses and accretion rates of 246 AGN. We also use these relations to estimate the relative sizes of the Hbeta, MgII and CIV emitting regions, and find evidence that the MgII emission may occur further out than Hbeta. In short, we provide a comprehensive benchmark of high redshift AGN reverberation mapping at the close of this most recent generation of surveys, including light curves, time-delays, and the most reliable radius-luminosity relations to date.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Egent: An Autonomous Agent for Equivalent Width Measurement</a><span class="id">[2512.01270]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Egent, an autonomous agent that combines classical multi-Voigt profile fitting with large language model (LLM) visual inspection and iterative refinement. The fitting engine is built from scratch with minimal dependencies, creating an ecosystem where the LLM can reason about fits through function calls-adjusting wavelength windows, adding blend components, modifying continuum treatment, and flagging problematic cases. Egent operates directly on raw flux spectra without requiring pre-normalized continua. We validate against manual measurements from human experts using 18,615 lines from the C3PO program across 84 Magellan/MIKE spectra at SNR 50-250. We find per-spectrum systematic offsets between Egent and expert measurements, likely arising from differences in global continuum placement prior to manual fitting; after accounting for these offsets, the agreement is 5-7 milliangstrom. The LLM's primary role is quality control: it confirms good fits ( 60-65% of lines are LLM-refined and accepted), flags problematic cases ( 10-20%), and occasionally rescues edge cases where tool use improves fits. Agreement between GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini confirms reproducibility, with GPT-5-mini enabling low-cost analysis at  200 lines per US dollar. Every fit stores complete Voigt parameters, continuum coefficients, and LLM reasoning chains, enabling exact reconstruction without re-running. Egent compresses what traditionally requires months of expert effort into days of automated analysis, enabling survey-scale EW measurement.

These experiments are tailored to mimic what is expected to be the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) accretion event, which occurred circa 10 Gyr ago in the Milky Way (MW). We find that either an early clumpy phase or a retrograde merger significantly reduces the star formation rate (SFR) of the disk, giving rise to a chemical bimodality qualitatively similar to the MW's. The decrease of the SFR as the cause of the chemical bimodality is consistent with previous idealized and cosmological simulations. On the other hand, a prograde radial merger does not significantly modify the SFR of the disk, resulting in no clear chemical bimodality. We further show that stars originating from the inner regions ($R_{form}&lt;4$ kpc) do not create the disk's chemical bimodality, although they can enhance it. Finally, only the models with an early clumpy phase can produce a significant fraction of old, age $&gt;11$ Gyr, $\alpha-$poor stars with disk-like orbits, similar to what has been recently observed in the MW. Our results strengthen the case of clumpy disky galaxies observed at redshift $z\approx 1-2$ as likely progenitors of our Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01350" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Milky Way stellar halo is twisted and doubly broken: insights from DESI DR2 Milky Way Survey observation</a><span class="id">[2512.01350]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using K giants from the second data release (DR2) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Milky Way (MW) Survey, we measure the shape, orientation, radial profile, and density anisotropies of the MW stellar halo over 8 kpc$&lt;r_\mathrm{GC}&lt;200$ kpc. We identify a triaxial stellar halo (axes ratio $10:8:7$), 43 degrees tilted from the disk, showing two break radii at $\sim16$ kpc and $\sim76$ kpc, likely associated with Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus (GSE) and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), respectively. The inner stellar halo ($&lt;30$ kpc) is oblate and aligned with the disk, whereas the outer stellar halo becomes prolate and perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the Vast Polar Structure of MW satellites. The twisted halo may arise from the disk-halo angular momentum shift triggered by the infall of a massive satellite. The anisotropic density distribution of the stellar halo is also measured, with successful re-identification of the Hercules-Aquila Cloud South/North (HAC-N/-S) and Virgo overdensities (VOD). Break radii are found at 15/30 kpc for VOD/HAC-N(-S). We identify the LMC transient density wake with a break radius at 60 kpc in the Pisces overdensity region. We also find new observational evidence of the LMC collective density wake, by showing a break radius at $\sim$100 kpc in the northern Galactic cap with a clear density peak at 90 kpc. In the end, we found that more metal-poor halo stars are more radially extended.

Using {\it Spitzer} 8 and 24 micron, and unWISE 12 $\mu$m images, HFSs are identified as regions where three or more filaments converge onto a central hub, appearing as absorption features toward IRDCs. In each IRDC, HFSs mainly lie at the intersections of elongated substructures, associated with groups of protostars and lacking radio continuum emission. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) analysis shows that protostars are closely associated with the HFSs, with protostellar core separations of $\leq$ 0.7 pc, indicating strong clustering within fragmented structures. The HFSs form two main groupings spanning 10–15 pc, with member separations of 1–3.3 pc. Around 65\% are tightly clustered ($&lt;$ 2 pc), exhibiting rich small-scale structures and emphasizing the uniqueness of the complex. MST analysis of ALMAGAL 1.38 mm continuum cores – predominantly low-mass and embedded in ten HFSs – reveals a median core separation of $\sim$0.03 pc. The protostellar spacing ($\sim$0.7 pc) significantly exceeds the thermal Jeans length ($\sim$0.08 pc for temperature $\sim$18 K and density $\sim$10$^{5}$ cm$^{-3}$), whereas the core spacing is smaller than the Jeans length, suggesting that thermal fragmentation may influence core formation but alone cannot explain the larger-scale protostellar distribution. All these findings together support a picture in which fragments of clouds/filaments form clumps hosting compact HFSs that facilitate efficient and clustered star formation, often yielding massive stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: The first statistical census of dusty and massive objects in the ERO/Perseus field</a><span class="id">[2512.01489]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our comprehension of the history of star formation at $z&gt;3$ relies on rest-frame UV observations, yet this selection misses the most dusty and massive sources, yielding an incomplete census at early times.

Recently, Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) have made it possible to further study such objects by comparing Euclid data with ancillary Spitzer/IRAC imaging. We investigate a $232$ arcmin$^2$ area in the Perseus field using VIS and NISP photometry, complemented by the four Spitzer channels and ground-based MegaCam bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, ${\rm H}\alpha$, $i$, $z$). Applying the colour cut yields $121$ HIEROs; after removing globular clusters, brown dwarfs, and unreliable cases through visual inspection of multiband cutouts, we obtain a final sample of $42$ robust HIEROs. Photometric redshifts and physical properties are estimated with the SED-fitting code Bagpipes. From the resulting $z_{\mathrm{phot}}$ and $M_*$ values, we compute the galaxy stellar mass function at $3.5&lt;z&lt;5.5$. Even after excluding possible AGN hosts or systems where the stellar mass may be overestimated, the high-mass end remains comparable to previous determinations, suggesting the true abundance could be higher. These results highlight the importance of further study of this obscured population to assess its role in the cosmic star-formation rate density and its consistency with galaxy-formation models, demonstrating Euclid's capability to advance our understanding of dust-hidden star formation across early epochs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hubble Missing Globular Cluster Survey.

When combined with Gaia positional measurements, this data set enables the investigation of the bulk motion and the internal kinematics of these poorly studied clusters to an unprecedented level of detail. Focusing on the case of NGC 6749, we here showcase how the combined Gaia HST proper motions have a quality sufficient to accurately assess the cluster stellar membership, determine its absolute proper motion with a precision superior to Gaia, and to investigate its kinematic profile for the first time. Proper motions are determined using the public code GAIAHUB, which for NGC 6749 combines data sets separated in time by 8 years. The resulting measurements improve the precision of Gaia proper motions by a factor of 10 at the faint end, and enable recovering the proper motion for 662 stars for which Gaia could only measure the positions. These proper motions are efficient in decontaminating the colour magnitude diagram of NGC 6749, and make it possible to compare the efficacy of a method of statistical decontamination that relies only on the photometric information extracted from the HST parallel fields. Finally, using the sample of best measured proper motions we determine the velocity dispersion and anisotropy profiles of NGC 6749, that reveal an isotropic behaviour in the cluster inner regions and a slight radial anisotropy outside 1.5 half light radii. The proper motions and the code to statistically decontaminate the clusters color magnitude diagram are made available as public products of the survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the ultra-faint dwarf Bootes I using JWST and HST: Metallicity distribution and binaries</a><span class="id">[2512.01547]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) are among the oldest and most metal-poor stellar systems in the Universe. Their metallicity distribution encodes the fossil record of the earliest star formation, feedback, and chemical enrichment, providing crucial tests of models of the first stars, galaxy assembly, and dark matter halos. However, due to their faint luminosities and the limited number of bright giants, spectroscopic studies of UFDs typically probe only small stellar samples. Here, we present an analysis of multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope observations of the UFD Bootes I. Using deep color-magnitude diagram in the F606W and F322W2 bands, extending from the subgiant branch to the M-dwarfs, and stellar proper motions to identify likely members, we obtained an unprecedentedly clean census of the system. The exquisite quality of the diagram, combined with the sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to metallicity, allowed us to constrain the metallicity distribution in a large stellar sample. As a first step, we derived the binary fraction in Bootes I. This is crucial, since binaries can bias kinematic mass estimates, affect stellar population analyses, and shape the photometric signatures used to infer metallicity. We find that 20$\pm$2% of stellar systems in Bootes I are binaries with mass ratios larger than 0.4, corresponding to a total binary fraction of $\sim$30%. This value is comparable to the binary fractions observed in globular clusters of similar stellar mass, suggesting that the presence of dark matter does not significantly affect the binary properties of Bootes I. We then exploited the metallicity sensitivity of M-dwarf colors to derive the metallicity distribution function. We find that most of the stars $\sim$85% have [Fe/H]&lt;-2, and that roughly $\sim$17% have [Fe/H]&lt;-3.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Black Hole to Galaxy: Neural Operator: Framework for Accretion and Feedback Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2512.01576]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs–making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ”subgrid black hole” that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Substellar Initial Mass Function of Trumpler 14</a><span class="id">[2512.01606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young, massive stellar clusters offer a prime setting to explore brown dwarf (BD) formation under high densities and intense UV radiation. Trumpler 14 (Tr 14), a 1 Myr-old cluster located at a distance of 2.4 kpc, and particularly rich in O-type stars, is an ideal target for such a study. Our goal is to measure the initial mass function (IMF) in the young massive, high UV flux cluster. We present the deepest study to date of the IMF in Tr 14 based on GeMS/GSAOI imaging. We construct the IMF using both the Besancon Galactic model and an observational control field from VISTA for background correction. Completeness was assessed using artificial-star tests and applied to the IMF derivation. We estimate the IMF down to the 20% completeness limit found at 0.01 MSun. Using the control field-based IMF as our primary result, we find a slope of alpha=0.14+-0.19 for masses between 0.01-0.2 MSun, and alpha=1.72+-0.04 for 0.2-4.5 MSun. The low-mass slope is largely influenced by the incompleteness-affected lowest bin; excluding it brings our results into agreement with those from other young clusters. The resulting median for the star-to-BD ratio in the 0.03-1 MSun mass range is 4.0, with a 95% confidence interval of 2.8-5.8. Our analysis reveals that Tr 14 hosts a relatively flat substellar IMF, but this is strongly influenced by the lowest-mass bin, which may be affected by incompleteness. When that bin is excluded, the IMF becomes consistent with those of other regions. The star-to-BD ratio falls within the usually observed 3-6 range, indicating that brown dwarfs with masses above 0.03 MSun form with similar efficiency across environments. However, the relative lack of objects below this threshold suggests that the presence of an environment with both high stellar density and FUV flux may play a role in shaping the IMF by suppressing the formation of BDs at masses &lt; 0.03 MSun.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for EeV photons with Telescope Array Surface Detector and neural networks</a><span class="id">[2512.01638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-high-energy photons play an important role in probing astrophysical models and beyond-Standard-Model scenarios.

We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_{\nu}\sim{\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\rm mm}/L_X\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transition from Outside-in to Inside-Out at $z\sim 2$: Evidence from Radial Profiles of Specific Star Formation Rate based on JWST/HST</a><span class="id">[2512.01684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>By combining high-resolution observations from JWST and HST, we have measured the stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and multi-wavelength morphologies of galaxies in the CANDELS fields.

For star-forming galaxies (SFGs), our results show excellent consistency with previous studies in terms of the star formation main sequence and the size-mass relation, demonstrating the robustness of our stellar mass and SFR measurements. For spatially resolved profiles, we find that at higher redshifts ($z&gt;2.5$), the median radial profile of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ is nearly parallel to but slightly steeper than that of $\Sigma_*$. This results in mildly negative gradients in the specific SFR (sSFR) profiles across all stellar mass bins considered. These findings indicate that galaxies at $z&gt;2.5$ cannot grow in size via only in-situ star formation, challenging the understanding of galaxy size evolution beyond the cosmic noon. In contrast, at $z&lt;2.0$, the sSFR profiles transition to exhibit more and more positive gradients at lower redshifts, consistent with an inside-out growth scenario where star formation preferentially expands the galactic outskirts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The chemical diversity of giant-planet nurseries as revealed by ALMA</a><span class="id">[2512.01731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the giant exoplanet occurrence rate peaking around stars of 1.5-2 solar masses, there is strong motivation to characterize the disks that set their formation conditions.

We find clear correlations between molecular tracers of C/O&gt;1 environments (e.g., CS, C2H) and disk mass, as traced by C18O line flux. In contrast, tracers of C/O&lt;1 environments (e.g., SO, CH3OH) do not show significant correlations with disk mass. Interestingly, these molecules are relatively brighter in lower-mass disks, with their presence primarily linked to disks with central cavities and spirals. Finally, we show that the observed chemical diversity seen across Herbig disks leads to varying C/O regimes at the orbital radii of candidate proto-planets identified within these disks. When comparing these inferred disk C/O ratios with those measured for directly imaged exoplanets, we find a notable overlap and show that low C/O gas is common on 10's of au scales in Herbig disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of new Galactic symbiotic stars with SALT - II.

Follow-up spectroscopy with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) was used to confirm their symbiotic nature and to characterize the cool and hot components of the full sample, including systems from earlier work. We report 14 newly confirmed bona fide symbiotic stars and identify 6 additional strong candidates. Photometric variability was examined using our data and archival light curves from multiple all-sky surveys. Most systems are variable, with the majority showing periodic modulation consistent with orbital motion or pulsations. Possible photometric orbital periods are reported for 19 confirmed and 3 candidate systems, pending spectroscopic confirmation. Eight objects exhibit signs of outburst activity. In one of the systems, multiple brightenings occur at similar orbital phases, closely resembling the evolution of FN Sgr, a symbiotic binary with a magnetic white dwarf. The peculiar variability of another symbiotic star is best explained by dust-obscuration events. These results expand the census of Galactic symbiotic stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First detections of methanol maser lines from a rare transition family</a><span class="id">[2512.01875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the first observations in a rare family of class II methanol maser transitions in both CH$_3$OH and $^{13}$CH$_3$OH toward three southern high-mass star formation regions, along with the first maser detected in the $^{13}$CH$_3$OH line.

Water emission in the Horsehead nebula is very weak and, surprisingly, extends outward beyond other PDR tracers such as $^{12}$CO or [CI] 609 $\mu$m, reaching as far out as [CII] 158 $\mu$m. We model the observations using a newly developed PDR wrapper that takes into account the geometry of this region. PDR modeling of the molecular and atomic lines studied here provides strong constraints on the thermal pressure, but not on the UV illumination. Maximum model line intensities %typically agree to within  40\% with the observations. and spatial profiles are well reproduced, except for CO isotopologues, where the increase on the illuminated side of the PDR is steeper than observed. Water vapor abundance in the model reaches $3.6 \times 10^{-7}$ at $A_V \sim 3$ mag. However, the ground state $o$-H$_2$O 557 GHz line is systematically overestimated by the models by at least a factor of 7 for any values of the model parameters. This line has a very high optical depth and the emergent line intensity is sensitive to radiative transfer effects such as line scattering by water molecules in a low-density halo surrounding the dense PDR and the assumed microturbulent line width. A more accurate model of the water surface chemistry is required.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST &amp; the Waz Arc I: Spatially Resolving the Physical Conditions within a Post-Starburst Galaxy at Redshift 5 with NIRSpec IFS</a><span class="id">[2512.02000]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present NIRSpec/IFS observations of a rest-frame UV-bright, massive ($M_* \sim 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$, $z_{AB}=20.5$) galaxy highly magnified by gravitational-lensing observed just after the end of the epoch of reionization ($z=5.04$, $\bar{\mu}\sim90$). With JWST accessing the restframe UV and optical spectrum of this galaxy with high fidelity, we classify this UV-bright galaxy as post-starburst in nature – due to weak/absent emission lines and strong absorption features – making this an example of a new class of UV-bright but significantly quenched galaxies being discovered in this epoch. With a median $E(B-V)=0.44\pm0.14$, we identify the presence of stellar absorption across the arc both in Balmer lines and the MgII doublet, indicative of older stellar populations dominated by A stars (and potentially B stars). Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-optical strong emission lines, we find a heterogeneous distribution of nebular metallicities across the arc, potentially hinting at different enrichment processes. With a low median lensing-corrected H$\alpha$ star formation rate of SFR$_{H\alpha} = 0.024 \pm 0.001$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we find in the most &quot;star-forming&quot; clumps indications of lower ionization (log$_{10}$U $\sim -3.2$), lower nebular metallicities (12+log$_{10}$O/H $\lesssim$ 8.3), and hints of higher densities that suggest a possible recent infall of more pristine (low metallicity) gas onto the galaxy. Investigating the regions with no detectable H$\beta$ emission, we find (for the first time at $z&gt;5$) signatures of diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Separating DIG from HII regions within a galaxy has predominantly been demonstrated at lower redshifts, where such spatial resolution allows clear separation of such regions – highlighting the immense power of gravitational lensing to enable studies at the smallest spatial scales at cosmic dawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI Agent for Source Finding by SoFiA-2 for SKA-SDC2</a><span class="id">[2512.00769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Source extraction is crucial in analyzing data from next-generation, large-scale sky surveys in radio bands, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Several source extraction programs, including SoFiA and Aegean, have been developed to address this challenge. However, finding optimal parameter configurations when applying these programs to real observations is non-trivial. For example, the outcomes of SoFiA intensely depend on several key parameters across its preconditioning, source-finding, and reliability-filtering modules. To address this issue, we propose a framework to automatically optimize these parameters using an AI agent based on a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, i.e., Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). The SKA Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset is utilized to assess the feasibility and reliability of this framework. The AI agent interacts with the environment by adjusting parameters based on the feedback from the SDC2 score defined by the SDC2 Team, progressively learning to select parameter sets that yield improved performance. After sufficient training, the AI agent can automatically identify an optimal parameter configuration that outperform the benchmark set by Team SoFiA within only 100 evaluation steps and with reduced time consumption. Our approach could address similar problems requiring complex parameter tuning, beyond radio band surveys and source extraction. Yet, high-quality training sets containing representative observations and catalogs of ground truth are essential.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy 1H 0323+342</a><span class="id">[1909.05525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Taking advantage of the most recent measurements by means of high-resolution radio observations and other multiwavelength campaigns, it is possible to elaborate a detailed map of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy 1H 0323+342.

In a bottom-up hierarchy, early collapse of low-mass halos preserves imprints of the primordial spectrum, whereas prolonged assembly of halos near $m_h^*$ erases that memory and establishes universality. We formulate a scale-to-scale cascade, the redistribution of mass and energy across scales, that yields universal scaling laws for the halo mass function and internal structure. Globally, the cascade drives a random walk of halos with mass-dependent waiting time $\tau_g\propto m_h^{-\lambda}$; A Fokker-Planck equation gives mass function $f_M\propto m_h^{-\lambda}$ and $\lambda=2/3$ for the gravity-dominant transition range. Locally, a radially directed cascade governs particle migration with waiting time $\tau_{gr}\propto r^{-\gamma}$, yielding density $\rho_r\propto r^{-2\gamma}$ and $\gamma=2/3$ on scales near $m_h^*$. The cascade drives the system toward a statistically steady state that continuously releases energy and maximizes entropy, characterized by scale-independent rates, preventing mass or energy buildup at intermediate scales. Scale-dependent dominance of the primordial spectrum versus gravity implies two effective exponents, producing double-$\lambda$ mass functions and double-$\gamma$ density in excellent agreement with simulations. Using Illustris and Virgo, we measure an inverse kinetic-energy cascade from small to large scales at $\varepsilon_u \approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$, a direct potential-energy cascade of $-1.4\varepsilon_u$, and a net dissipation of -0.4$\varepsilon_u$ via halo mergers and particle migration. The dependence of waiting time and step length on the particle mass suggests new constraints near $10^{12}$GeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back from the dead: AT2019aalc as a candidate repeating TDE in an AGN</a><span class="id">[2408.17419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context.

Our aim is to constrain the physical mechanism responsible for the second optical flare, which may also provide clues to the origin of the initial event. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023/2024. Results. The observations revealed multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient and a uniquely bright UV counterpart. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conslusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. We propose a repeating TDE scenario within an AGN framework to explain the multi-wavelength properties of AT2019aalc and suggest a possible connection among ECLEs, BFFs, and TDEs occurring in AGNs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</a><span class="id">[2504.05235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves  3% average error for $\xi$ and  5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Phenylium Reactivity under Interstellar Relevant Conditions</a><span class="id">[2506.13290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent work by Kocheril \textit{et al.}\cite{kocheril2025} claimed that phenylium–the cyclic structure of the \ce{C6H5+} species–is unreactive toward key interstellar molecules such as molecular hydrogen (\ce{H2}) and acetylene (\ce{C2H2}). This finding challenges the previously proposed role of phenylium as a cornerstone in the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) \cite{cherchneff1992,byrne2024}. The study focused on the reactivity of \ce{C6H5+}, formed via the radiative association between \ce{C4H3+} and \ce{C2H2}, believed to be a major pathway for phenylium formation in astrochemical model, e.g. \cite{byrne2024}. Here, we present new experimental and theoretical evidence that challenges this assumption. Our results demonstrate that phenylium does indeed react with \ce{C2H2} under astrophysically relevant conditions. Quantum chemical calculations support this finding by revealing a barrierless mechanism, indicating that the reaction is feasible even in cold interstellar environments. We believe this clarification is critically important, and that further investigations into the formation of the first aromatic ring in space–a process that remains a key bottleneck in our understanding of PAHs formation and growth–is essential.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Structure and Magnetic Field of Bright-rimmed Cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38</a><span class="id">[2506.14137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We carried out polarimetric observations of the bright-rimmed cloud IC 1396E/SFO 38 with SCUBA-2/POL-2 to study the effect of ultraviolet (UV) light on its structure and magnetic field.

The magnetic field directions of the cloud are different from the ambient field direction, demonstrating the field reconfiguration. The distortion or pinch of the magnetic field is seen toward the cloud head, where an intermediate-mass star cluster is located, suggesting gravitational contraction.

In this paper, we explore a range of computational techniques aimed at accelerating SPS predictions of galaxy photometry using the JAX library to target GPUs. We study a particularly advantageous approximation to the calculation of galaxy photometry that speeds up the computation by a factor of 50 relative to the exact calculation. We introduce a novel technique for incorporating burstiness into models of galaxy star formation history that captures very short-timescale fluctuations with negligible increase in computation time. We study the performance of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithms in which individual chains are parallelized across independent GPU threads, finding that our pipeline can carry out Bayesian inference at a rate of approximately $1000$ galaxy posteriors per minute on a single GPU. Our results provide an update to standard benchmarks in the literature on the computational demands of SPS inference; our publicly available code enables previously-impractical Bayesian analyses of large galaxy samples, and includes several standalone modules that could be adopted to speedup existing SPS pipelines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbit-based structural decomposition and stellar population recovery for edge-on barred galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.10832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our previous paper, we developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies and constructed a set of dynamical models based on different mock observations of three galaxies from the Auriga simulations.

We decomposed these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits. We then compared the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin discs, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and discs are well constrained with absolute biases of $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.15$. We recovered the mass fractions of halos with $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.03$.

Using a sample of $N=159$ SFGs at $1&lt;z&lt;8$, observed with deep medium-resolution spectroscopy from the JWST/NIRSpec EXCELS survey, we perform a statistical analysis of their ionizing photon production efficiencies ($\xi_\rm{ion}$). We consider $\xi_\rm{ion}$, measured with Balmer line measurements, in relation to a number of key galaxy properties including; nebular emission line strengths ($W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ and $W_\lambda$( [OIII])), UV luminosity ($M_\rm{UV}$) and UV slope ($\beta_\rm{UV}$), as well as dust attenuation ($E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$) and redshift. Implementing a Bayesian linear regression methodology, we fit $\xi_\rm{ion}$ against the principal observables while fully marginalising over all measurement uncertainties, mitigating against the impact of outliers and determining the intrinsic scatter. Significant relations between $\xi_\rm{ion}$ and $ W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$, $W_\lambda$([OIII]) and $\beta_\rm{UV}$ are recovered. Moreover, the weak trends with $M_\rm{UV}$ and redshift can be fully explained by the remaining property dependencies. Expanding our analysis to multivariate regression, we determine that $W_\lambda(\rm{H\alpha})$ or $W_\lambda$([OIII]), along with $\beta_\rm{UV}$ and $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}$, are the most important observables for accurately predicting $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$. The latter identifies the most common outliers as SFGs with relatively high $E(B-V)_\rm{neb}\gtrsim0.5$, possibly indicative of obscured star-formation or strong differential attenuation. Combining these properties enable $\xi_\rm{ion,0}$ to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.15\,$dex, with a population intrinsic scatter of $\sigma_\rm{int}\sim0.035\,$dex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric stellar masses for galaxies in DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</a><span class="id">[2510.02257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In many areas of extragalactic astrophysics, we need to convert the luminosity of a galaxy into its stellar mass.

This survey provides an unsurpassed combination of a deep imaging with an extensive sky coverage in up to four photometric bands. We calibrated the sought formula against a sample of local galaxies observed by the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^4$G) that was directly dedicated to measure the stellar masses. For the absolute magnitudes $M_g$ and $M_r$ of a galaxy in the Legacy Surveys $g$ and $r$ bands, we find that the stellar masses can be estimated as $0.673M_g - 1.108M_r + 0.996$ with the scatter of 25\%. Employing more complex functions does not improve the estimate appreciably, even after including the galaxy ellipticity, Sérsic index, or the magnitudes in different Legacy Surveys bands. Generally, measurements in $r$ band were the most helpful ones, while adding $z$-band measurements did not improve the mass estimate much. We provide a Python-based script \texttt{photomass\ this http URL } to automatically download images of any galaxy from the Legacy Surveys database, create image masks, generate GALFIT input files with well-assessed initial values, perform the GALFIT photometry, and calculate the stellar mass estimate.

We observe magnetic field amplification up to more than $\vert \mathbf{B}\vert_{\rm max}&gt;10^5$ G in the second core, which is surrounded by a small ($&lt;0.5 au) disk. This application demonstrates the robustness of our scheme in multi-scale and high-resolution simulations on arbitrary meshes and, as such, the model can be readily used for further simulations of protostar formation at high resolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapid, out of equilibrium metal enrichment indicated by a flat mass-metallicity relation at z 6 from NIRCam grism spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2510.19959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We aim to characterise the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) and the 3D correlation between stellar mass, metallicity and star-formation rate (SFR) known as the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) for galaxies at $5&lt;z&lt;7$. Using $\sim800$ [O III] selected galaxies from deep NIRCam grism surveys, we present our stacked measurements of direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities, which we use to test recent strong-line metallicity calibrations. Our measured direct-$T\rm_e$ metallicities ($0.1$-$0.2\,\rm Z_\odot$ for M$_\star$ $\approx5\times10^{7-9}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively) match recent JWST/NIRSpec-based results. However, there are significant inconsistencies between observations and hydrodynamical simulations. We observe a flatter MZR slope than the SPHINX$^{20}$ and FLARES simulations, which cannot be attributed to selection effects. With simple models, we show that the effect of an [O III] flux-limited sample on the observed shape of the MZR is strongly dependent on the FMR. If the FMR is similar to the one in the local Universe, the intrinsic high-redshift MZR should be even flatter than observed. In turn, a 3D relation where SFR correlates positively with metallicity at fixed mass would imply an intrinsically steeper MZR. Our measurements indicate that metallicity variations at fixed mass show little dependence on the SFR, suggesting a flat intrinsic MZR. This could indicate that the low-mass galaxies at these redshifts are out of equilibrium and that metal enrichment occurs rapidly in low-mass galaxies. However, being limited by our stacking analysis, we are yet to probe the scatter in the MZR and its dependence on SFR. Large carefully selected samples of galaxies with robust metallicity measurements can put tight constraints on the high-redshift FMR and, help to understand the interplay between gas flows, star formation and feedback in early galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Figuring Out Gas &amp; Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) XI: Circumgalactic O VI Emission Traces Clumpy Inflowing Recycled Gas</a><span class="id">[2510.25844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The circumgalactic medium (CGM) is host to gas flows into and out of galaxies and regulates galaxy growth, but the multiphase, diffuse gas in this region is challenging to observe. We investigate the properties of gas giving rise to O VI emission from the CGM that upcoming missions, such as the Aspera SmallSat, will be able to map in local galaxies. We use the FOGGIE simulations to predict the O VI emission from edge-on galaxies across the redshift range $z=1\rightarrow0$. O VI emission is brightest surrounding small, clumpy structures near the galaxy where the gas density is high. Most of the O VI surface brightness originates from collisionally ionized, $T\sim10^{5.5}$ K, inflowing gas and is not preferentially aligned with the major or minor axis of the galaxy disk. Simulated galaxies with higher halo masses, higher median CGM gas density, and higher star formation rates produce brighter and more widespread O VI emission in their CGM. We show that while O VI emission primarily originates in inflowing gas, turning off outflows in a simulation without star formation feedback eliminates most of the O VI emission. Enrichment from feedback is necessary to mix with the inflowing gas and allow it to glow in O VI. Collectively, our findings point towards a picture where O VI emission traces warm, ionized envelopes of cooler clouds that are accreting onto the galaxy in a metal-enriched galactic fountain. Finally, we show that the detection limit of Aspera is sufficient to detect O VI emission tens of kpc from the galaxy center for $\sim L^\star$ galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ACES: The Magnetic Field in Large Filaments in the Galactic Center</a><span class="id">[2511.18029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Galactic Center (GC) is an extreme region of the Milky Way that is host to a complex set of thermal and non-thermal structures. In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary &quot;bones&quot; observed previously in the Galactic Disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20300" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tails of Gravity: Persistence of Star Formation in the CMZ Environment</a><span class="id">[2511.20300]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We characterize star-forming gas in six molecular clouds (Sgr B1-off, Sgr B2, Sgr C, the 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 50 km s$^{-1}$ molecular clouds, and the Brick) in the Galactic central molecular zone (CMZ), and compare their star-forming activities with those in molecular clouds outside the CMZ. Using multi-band continuum observations taken from ${\it Planck}$, ${\it Herschel}$, JCMT/SCUBA-2, and CSO/SHARC2, we derived 8.5&quot; resolution column density maps for the CMZ clouds and evaluated the column density probability distribution functions (N-PDFs). With the archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.3 mm dust continuum data, we further evaluated the mass of the most massive cores ($M_{\rm core}^{\rm ma x}$). We find that the N-PDFs of four of the selected CMZ clouds are well described by a piecewise log-normal + power-law function, while the N-PDFs of the remaining two can be approximated by log-normal functions. In the first four targets, the masses in the power-law component ($M_{\rm gas}^{\rm bound}$), $M_{\rm core}^{\rm max}$, and star formation rate (SFR) are correlated. These correlations are very similar to those derived from low-mass clouds in the Solar neighborhood and massive star-forming regions on the Galactic disk. These findings lead to our key hypotheses: (1) In the extreme environment of the CMZ, the power-law component in the N-PDF also represents self-gravitationally bound gas structures, and (2) evolution and star-forming activities of self-gravitationally bound gas structures may be self-regulated, insensitive to the exterior environment on $\gtrsim$5-10 pc scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04280" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Periapsis shift in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime</a><span class="id">[2507.04280]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the periapsis shift of timelike bound orbits in the equatorial plane in the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime, which is an exact, static, axisymmetric, and vacuum solution characterized by the deformation parameter $\gamma$, including the Schwarzschild spacetime as $\gamma = 1$.

Applying this formula to observational data on S2, a star orbiting closely to Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), we show that the parameter $\gamma$ is constrained to $\gamma \gtrsim 1.9 \times 10^{-2}$ for the gravitational field of Sgr A*. This is equivalent to $\tilde{M}_2 \lesssim 9.7 \times 10^2$ in terms of the dimensionless quadrupole moment $\tilde{M}_2$, that is, the supermassive compact object at Sgr A* cannot be very prolate, whereas $\tilde{M}_2 \geq -1/3$ is required from the solution.

We use Gaia astrometry to search for planetary and stellar companions in a sample of 98 transition disks, assessing the occurrence rate of such companions and their potential influence on cavity formation. For the 98 Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), we compute Gaia proper motion anomalies which, together with the RUWE, identify companions with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 0.01$ at $\sim$0.1-30 au. We assess the impact of disk gravity, accretion, disk-scattered light, dippers, starspots, jets, and outflows on the measured proper motion anomalies, concluding that astrometric techniques such as the one of this work can be robustly applied to YSOs. Significant proper motion anomalies are found in 31 transition disks (32% of the sample), indicative of companions. We recover 85% of known companions within our sensitivity range. We model the semi-major axis and mass required for a companion to reproduce the observed astrometric signals. Most inferred companions have $M &gt; 30$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, placing many within or near the stellar mass regime. Seven sources host companions compatible with a planetary mass ($M &lt; 13$ M$\rm{_{J}}$, HD 100453, J04343128+1722201, J16102955-3922144, MHO6, MP Mus, PDS 70, and Sz 76). For the non-detections, we provide the companion masses and semi-major axes that can be excluded in future searches. About half (53%) of detected companions cannot be reconciled with having carved the observed dust cavities. We find that transition disks host as many companions within our sensitivity range as do randomly sampled groups of YSOs and main-sequence stars. If dust cavities are shaped by companions, such companions must reside at larger orbital separations than those of the companions detected here, and we predict them to be of planetary mass.

The direct imaging method captures exoplanet light while minimizing light from the host star. This is conventionally achieved with a coronagraph, which allows detailed characterization of planetary atmospheres and features. The Photonic Lantern Nuller (PLN) is an innovative instrument designed for the direct detection of closely orbiting exoplanets within the inner working angle of standard coronagraphs. Unlike traditional coronagraphs, where the planet's signal is usually rotationally invariant, with the same point-spread-function at different position angles, and which also overlaps minimally with the residual stellar signal, data from a PLN consist of a one-dimensional collection of points that do not have rotational invariance and overlap significantly with the residual starlight arising from wavefront errors. Exploiting angular diversity to subtract these stellar residuals with the PLN thus requires adapting the Angular Differential Imaging (ADI) technique for use with non-rotationally invariant planet signals at close separations, where strong self-subtraction effects occur. We reformulate ADI using principal component analysis to develop a method to extract spatial parameters of exoplanets from simulated one-dimensional PLN data. We test two variations of ADI on simulated data and show that injecting an antiplanet signal before stellar estimation helps localize the planet due to self-subtraction at lower separations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interferometry of Massive Stars: Multiplicity, Magnetism, and Stellar Winds</a><span class="id">[2512.00444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>After decades of efforts, optical long-baseline interferometry has become a mainstream observational technique in terms of operation robustness and user friendliness.

The main reason for the deviation is that the synthetic radio pulsar catalog is truncated based on a cut on the pulsar signal to noise ratio (SNR), which has a non-linear dependence on the flux along with plenty of scatter. We show that the disagreement is exacerbated as we raise the SNR threshold. We then demonstrate that if we create a synthetic catalog based on a flux cut (instead of an SNR-based threshold), we can recover the true distance exponent, with an accuracy ranging from pristine agreement to within $\pm 1 \sigma$ depending on the chosen flux threshold.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A First Order Filter for the Detection of Potentially Habitable Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2512.00899]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for potentially habitable exoplanets is a primary objective in modern astrophysics, yet the vast number of candidates discovered by missions like Kepler and TESS presents a significant challenge for detailed follow-up characterization. An efficient and reliable method for prioritizing the most promising targets is therefore essential. In this paper, we propose a novel first-order filter for identifying potentially habitable worlds based on a simple geometric ratio: the orbital semi-major axis to the stellar diameter ($d/D_s$). Using data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we demonstrate that the ideal value for this ratio is not constant, but is dependent on the host star's spectral class. We establish a tiered framework of ideal ratios, beginning with $\approx 108$ for G-type stars (anchored by the Earth-Sun system), and decreasing by a factor of two for K-type ($\approx 54$) and M-type ($\approx 27$) stars, respectively. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation, showing that exoplanets whose $d/D_s$ ratios are close to these empirically derived values consistently exhibit high Earth Similarity Index (ESI) scores. We propose that these tiered ratios represent &quot;Habitability Main Sequences,&quot; analogous to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for stars, providing a valuable and straightforward tool for the astronomical community to rapidly screen large datasets and efficiently shortlist high-priority candidates for further investigation with next-generation observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quiet Skies Report: A Primer on Protecting Radio Astronomy in the Age of Satellite Mega-Constellations</a><span class="id">[2512.00941]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid expansion of satellite constellations is transforming the radio-frequency environment around the Earth.

However, confirming these candidates as true planets demands meticulous vetting and follow-up observations, which hampers the discovery of exoplanets in large-scale datasets. To address this challenge, we developed a machine learning framework trained on Kepler's catalog of confirmed exoplanets and false positives to accurately identify true planetary candidates. Our model uses transit properties, planetary characteristics, and host stellar parameters as training features. The optimized model achieved 83.9% accuracy in cross-validation. When applied to 3987 TESS candidates with complete observational data, the model identified 1595 new high-confidence planets and correctly recovered 86% (358/418) of all previously confirmed TESS exoplanets in a blinded validation test. Our analysis revealed 100 previously unrecognized multi-planet systems, including five systems–that host habitable-zone exoplanets. Additionally, we identified 15 more planets within the habitable zone of a single system, suggesting strong potential for liquid water stability under conservative planetary albedo assumptions.

During spacecraft development, we verified through a structural-thermal-optical performance (STOP) analysis that the built and verified telescope with its spacecraft interface meets the in-orbit steady-state and transient image quality requirements. Methods. For the purposes of the STOP analysis, a detailed finite-element mathematical model was set up and a standard set of test cases, both steady-state and transient, was defined, comprising combinations of worst-case boundary conditions. Results. The STOP analysis addressed the interaction of all spacecraft components in transmitting temperature-induced loads that lead to optical train deformation. The results of the prelaunch analysis demonstrated that temperature-induced optical perturbations will be well below the allowable limits for all permitted observing conditions. During the first year in orbit, we used the STOP analysis predictions to help interpret the measured performance as a function of environmental variables. Unpredicted disturbances were discovered and unexpected sensitivities were revealed. In-orbit temperature variations are small (&lt;300 mK) and so are their effects on the telescope structure, but they are detected in the time histories of the image quality metrics and are a non-negligible factor in the PSF stability budget demanded by the WL science. Taking everything into account, our analysis confirms the excellent overall performance of the telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kratos-polrad: Novel GPU system for Monte-Carlo simulations with consistent polarization calculations</a><span class="id">[2512.01283]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarized radiation serves as a vital diagnostic tool in astrophysics, providing unique insights into magnetic field geometries, scattering processes, and three-dimensional structures in diverse astrophysical scenarios.

Additionally, we investigate how environmental conditions influence post-processed noise distributions and detection thresholds. We generate detection maps and contrast curves for 213 observations in the F150 SHINE sample using the RSM algorithm. A clustering approach based on environmental parameters is used to group observations with similar noise characteristics. We propose two methods for defining radial detection thresholds in the RSM maps: fitting a log-normal distribution to the post-processed noise and maximizing the F1 score. We also assess the performance of various combinations of post-processing techniques within the RSM framework to identify optimal configurations. This study demonstrates the utility of clustering based on observational parameters, effectively distinguishing features like wind-driven halos and low-wind effects. Detection thresholds vary significantly across clusters, differing by up to a factor of 10, highlighting the importance of considering observational environments. Log-normal thresholds provide conservative, noise-aware limits, while F1 score-based thresholds offer observation-specific results, both showing compatibility overall. RSM improves detection limits by an average factor of two at 1arcsec and five at inner working angles compared to standard PCA processing.

The method is validated on simulated and real astronomical time series, including the yearly sunspots number record, Kepler Lightcurves data of the red giant KIC 12008916, and TESS photometry of the exoplanet host star Ross 176. In all cases, the algorithm correctly identified the true or best-fitting model while simultaneously yielding well constrained posterior distributions for the model parameters. Our results demonstrate that Nested Sampling offers a potentially rigorous alternative to autoregressive model selection in astronomical time series analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pixel-Based Non-Linearity Correction for the WFC3 IR Detector</a><span class="id">[2512.01951]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current non-linearity correction for the Wide Field Camera 3 Infrared (WFC3/IR) channel is based on ground-based data acquired during WFC3's Thermal Vacuum 3 (TV3) testing campaign. In the current reference file, the correction coefficients derived for each pixel are averaged over each of the four detector quadrants. In this work, we compute a new pixel-based non-linearity correction using in-flight calibration observations with the internal tungsten lamp flats acquired between 2011 and 2013. We derive the new correction coefficients by fitting a third-order polynomial to the accumulated signal “up-the-ramp&quot; for each pixel. Approximately 2\% of IR detector pixels are flagged as bad, and a solution cannot be computed. For these, we use the quadrant averages of the new correction coefficients. An accompanying report (\cite{huynh2025}) provides detailed testing results using both internal flats and external science targets acquired in a variety of observing modes. The report highlights improvements in photometry derived from “\ this http URL &quot; data products calibrated using the new reference file, with the largest improvement for pixels with fluence levels approaching the full well limit of $\sim$80,000 $e^- $. A new NLINFILE reference file was delivered in October 2025 and will be used to reprocess all WFC3/IR imaging and grism observations in the MAST archive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Real-time RFI Excision Techniques and Their Limitations</a><span class="id">[2512.01954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio astronomy is facing critical challenges due to an ever-increasing human-made signal density filling up the radio spectrum. With the rise of satellites, mobile networks, and other wireless technologies, radio telescopes are struggling with radio frequency interference (RFI), which can masquerade, block or distort astronomical signals. In this chapter, we explain where RFI comes from, how it affects observations, and discuss different ways to reduce or remove interference. The techniques presented here reflect the state of the art in real-time RFI mitigation at the time of publication and include methods such as filtering, digital processing, and optimal scheduling. The proposed catalogue also explores new ideas like satellite avoidance through scheduling, the use of intelligent surfaces to block interference, and advanced computer algorithms to clean up data. The chapter also highlights the need for strong cooperation between astronomers and spectrum regulators to protect radio frequencies for future discoveries. By combining technical solutions and better policies, we can help ensure that radio astronomy continues to provide important insights into the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Astrometric Resoeccentric Degeneracy: Eccentric Single Planets Mimic 2:1 Resonant Planet Pairs in Astrometry</a><span class="id">[2512.02007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detections of long-period giant exoplanets will expand dramatically with Gaia Data Release 4 (DR4), but interpreting these signals will require care. We derive the astrometric resoeccentric degeneracy: an astrometric analogue of the well-known radial velocity degeneracy in which a single eccentric planet can mimic two circular planets near a 2:1 period ratio. To first order in eccentricity, the sky-projected motion of a single eccentric orbit decomposes into a fundamental mode and first harmonic with an amplitude proportional to that eccentricity. A pair of coplanar, circular planets in a 2:1 orbital resonance produces the same harmonic structure: the outer planet sets the fundamental mode, while the inner planet supplies an apparent first harmonic. We present a mapping between the harmonic amplitudes and effective eccentricity ($e_\mathrm{eff}$) of a single planet that mimics a 2:1 configuration, demonstrating that $e_\mathrm{eff} = \, 2^{1/3}(M_{p,2}/M_{p,1})$, the masses of the inner and outer planets, respectively. Using simulated Gaia data we show that (1) coplanar 2:1 systems are statistically indistinguishable from a single eccentric planet and (2) mutual inclination can break this degeneracy. This bias favors detecting mutually inclined systems, often fingerprints of a dynamically hot history – traces for processes such as planet-planet scattering or secular chaos. Determining the planetary architectures in which this degeneracy holds will be essential for measuring cool-giant occurrence rates with Gaia and for inferring their dynamical evolution histories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surveys on the Existence of Extraterrestrial Intelligent Life and Effects of Revealing Expert Consensus</a><span class="id">[2512.00364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Vickers et al. (2025) established that 58.20% of astrobiology experts believe intelligent extraterrestrial life likely exists, providing the first empirical baseline for public comparison. We surveyed 6,114 highly educated and scientifically engaged individuals (77.60% bachelor's degree+; 67.99% high-to-very-high scientific engagement) to assess their beliefs about extraterrestrial intelligent life existence: (1) personal beliefs, (2) perceived social circle beliefs, (3) perceived expert beliefs, and (4) responses to expert consensus revelation. Results showed 95.01% believed extraterrestrial intelligent life exists, with 62.59% holding definitive rather than probable convictions. Participants exhibited massive pluralistic ignorance, a 'cosmic closet', underestimating social circle beliefs by 46.07 percentage points despite near-universal personal conviction. Participants also exhibited a novel 'conviction intensity gap': while overestimating expert belief prevalence (67.63% vs. 58.20% actual), they underestimated expert conviction strength, perceiving only 21.10% as holding definitive beliefs. Experimental revelation of actual consensus (N = 5,106; 83.51% passed manipulation check) produced negligible personal belief change (d = -0.11) and small social belief change (d = 0.14). These findings demonstrate that consensus misperception operates along two dimensions, prevalence and intensity, and that even scientifically engaged audiences resist belief revision via expert consensus information.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00554" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large/small eddy simulations: A posteriori analysis in high Reynolds number isotropic turbulence</a><span class="id">[2512.00554]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While direct numerical simulations (DNS) are the most accurate method for studying turbulence, their large computational cost restricts their use to idealized configurations and to Reynolds numbers well below those found in practical systems. A recently proposed method, Large/Small Eddy Simulation (L/SES), aims to overcome this limitation while still providing the solution fidelity comparable to that of DNS. L/SES represents a pair of coupled calculations: a lower-fidelity Large Eddy Simulation (LES), which captures the large-scale flow structure, and a high-fidelity Small-Eddy Simulation (SES) targeting a sub-region of interest of the LES, in which the small-scale dynamics is fully resolved. In this study, we demonstrate the accuracy and performance of L/SES in large Reynolds-number homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) up to Taylor-scale Reynolds number approximately 600. Turbulence properties obtained with L/SES are shown to be in close agreement with the literature, both in terms of global characteristics, such as kinetic energy spectra and dissipative anomaly, as well as small-scale properties, such as higher-order moments of the velocity gradients up to the 10th order and probability density functions of the intermittent quantities. Also using simulations of HIT, we systematically investigate various method parameters and determine their optimal converged values. Finally, we discuss the computational cost of L/SES and demonstrate that it is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than for a traditional DNS at the highest Reynolds number considered here. This highlights the potential of L/SES as a discovery tool, which brings high-fidelity simulations of realistic flows into the realm of feasibility.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiometric sensitivity and resolution of synthetic tracking imaging for orbital debris monitoring</a><span class="id">[2211.09789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider sampling and detection strategies for solar illuminated space debris. We argue that the lowest detectable debris cross section may be reduced by 10-100x by analysis of stacks of image frames collected at high rates rather than single frame data. In particular, instead of a pixel as a spatial region, the analysis is based on a &quot;phase-space-pixel&quot; which corresponds to an angular velocity and space region and whose intensity is computed by a weighted stacking of spatial pixels corresponding to a test debris trajectory within a wide camera field-of-view (FOV). To isolate debris signals from background, the exposure time is set to match the time it takes a debris to transit through the instantaneous field of view. Debris signatures are detected by multiscale X-ray processing of the data cube. Radiometric analysis of line integrals shows that sub-cm objects in Low Earth Orbit can be detected and assigned full orbital parameters by this approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What can we learn about Reionization astrophysical parameters using Gaussian Process Regression?</a><span class="id">[2407.19481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reionization is one of the least understood processes in the evolution history of the Universe, mostly because of the numerous astrophysical processes occurring simultaneously about which we do not have a very clear idea so far. In this article, we use the Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) method to learn the reionization history and infer the astrophysical parameters. We reconstruct the UV luminosity density function using the HFF and early JWST data. From the reconstructed history of reionization, the global differential brightness temperature fluctuation during this epoch has been computed. We perform MCMC analysis of the global 21-cm signal using the instrumental specifications of SARAS, in combination with Lyman-$\alpha$ ionization fraction data, Planck optical depth measurements and UV luminosity data. Our analysis reveals that GPR can help infer the astrophysical parameters in a model-agnostic way than conventional methods. Additionally, we analyze the 21-cm power spectrum using the reconstructed history of reionization and demonstrate how the future 21-cm mission SKA, in combination with Planck and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest data, improves the bounds on the reionization astrophysical parameters by doing a joint MCMC analysis for the astrophysical parameters plus 6 cosmological parameters for $\Lambda$CDM model. The results make the GPR-based reconstruction technique a robust learning process and the inferences on the astrophysical parameters obtained therefrom are quite reliable that can be used for future analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VEGA: Voids idEntification using Genetic Algorithm</a><span class="id">[2501.16431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic voids are large, nearly empty regions that lie between the web of galaxies, filaments and walls, and are recognized for their extensive applications in the field of cosmology and astrophysics. Despite their significance, a universal definition of voids remains unsettled as various void-finding methods identify different types of voids, each differing in shape and density, based on the method that were used. In this paper, we present VEGA, a novel algorithm for void identification. VEGA utilizes Voronoi tessellation to divide the dataset space into spatial cells and applies the Convex Hull algorithm to estimate the volume of each cell. It then integrates Genetic Algorithm analysis with luminosity density contrast to filter out over-dense cells and retain the remaining ones, referred to as void block cells. These filtered cells form the basis for constructing the final void structures. VEGA operates on a grid of points, which increases the algorithm's spatial accessibility to the dataset and facilitates the identification of seed points around which the algorithm constructs the voids. To evaluate VEGA's performance, we applied both VEGA and the Aikio Mähönen method to the same test dataset. We compared the resulting void populations in terms of their luminosity and number density contrast, as well as their morphological features such as sphericity. This comparison demonstrated that the VEGA void finding method yields reliable results and can be effectively applied to various particle distributions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO): Options for robust Deep Spectral Line Imaging in the SKA-Era</a><span class="id">[2511.17307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The data storage requirements for deep spectral line observations with next-generation radio interferometers like the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are extremely challenging. The default strategy is to reduce data after each daily observation and stack the resulting images. Although this approach is computationally efficient, it risks propagating systematic errors and significantly degrades the final data quality. However, storage and computation requirements for a traditional way to image the entire deep dataset together are prohibitively expensive. We present an alternative \textit{uv}-grid stacking method and compare its scientific outcomes with both the traditional approach, which processes all data jointly and serves as the best-possible result, and the default image-stacking method. Our technique involves halting the standard imaging pipeline after the daily residual visibility grids are formed. These grids are then stacked and jointly deconvolved to combine many epochs of data. Using the traditional approach as a benchmark, we show that image-stacking recovers only 92\% of the true {\HI} flux. In contrast, our \textit{uv}-grid stacking method recovers 99\%, which is in excellent agreement with the traditional method within the noise limits. Furthermore, image-stacking introduces significant non-physical artefacts, such as negative bowls around strong sources, indicating poor deconvolution and a loss of physical information. Based on these findings, we intend to apply the \textit{uv}-grid stacking to the Deep Investigation of Neutral Gas Origins (DINGO) survey on ASKAP and strongly recommend this or a similar approach for future radio astronomy facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of the Hamamatsu R12699-406-M4 Photomultiplier Tube in Cold Xenon Environments</a><span class="id">[2506.04844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hamamatsu R12699-406-M2 is a $2\times2$ multi-anode 2-inch photomultiplier tube that offers a compact form factor, low intrinsic radioactivity, and high photocathode coverage. These characteristics make it a promising candidate for next-generation xenon-based direct detection dark matter experiments, such as XLZD and PandaX-xT. We present a detailed characterization of this photosensor operated in cold xenon environments, focusing on its single photoelectron response, dark count rate, light emission, and afterpulsing behavior. The device demonstrated a gain exceeding $2\cdot 10^6$ at the nominal voltage of -1.0 kV, along with a low dark count rate of $(0.4\pm0.2)\;\text{Hz/cm}^2$. Due to the compact design, afterpulses exhibited short delay times, resulting in some cases in an overlap with the light-induced signal. To evaluate its applicability in a realistic detector environment, two R12699-406-M2 units were deployed in a small-scale dual-phase xenon time projection chamber. The segmented $2\times2$ anode structure enabled lateral position reconstruction using a single photomultiplier tube, highlighting the potential of the sensor for effective event localization in future detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MHDuet : a high-order General Relativistic Radiation MHD code for CPU and GPU architectures</a><span class="id">[2510.13965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A synchronization-free one-way ranging observable for detecting and characterizing coherent orbital-period systematics in GRACE-FO laser ranging data</a><span class="id">[2511.14782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a synchronization-free differential observable for one-way inter-satellite laser ranging, designed to suppress first-order Doppler effects without requiring clock synchronization between spacecraft. The observable is constructed from successive pulse-interval differences, which isolate time-varying signatures while eliminating static and slowly varying biases. Applied to GRACE-FO Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI) Level-1B data over four seasonal epochs in 2019, the method reveals a stable, spectrally narrow modulation at the orbital frequency. The amplitude and phase of the detected signature remain consistent across all datasets, demonstrating a deterministic, mission-internal origin. The detection is independently confirmed through synthetic-signal injection, shuffle-based significance testing, and cross-comparison with K-band ranging data. These results show that the proposed observable provides a sensitive diagnostic for identifying coherent orbital-period systematics that may remain hidden in conventional range-rate analysis. The method offers a pathway toward improved characterization of instrument and dynamical effects in current and future satellite gravity missions.</p></div></details></article></body>
