We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The imprints of massive neutrinos on the 3-point correlation function of large-scale structures</a><span class="id">[2512.16992]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Free-streaming of cosmic neutrinos impacts the distribution and growth of cosmic structures on small scales, allowing constraints on the sum of neutrino masses $M_\nu$ from clustering studies. In this work, we investigate for the first time the possibility of disentangling massive neutrino cosmologies with the 3-point correlation function (3PCF). We measure the isotropic connected 3PCF $\zeta$ and the reduced 3PCF $Q$ of halo catalogues from the Quijote suite of N-body simulations, considering $M_\nu =0.0, 0.1, 0.2,$ and $0.4 \, \mathrm{eV}$ in different redshift bins. We develop a framework to quantify the detectability of massive neutrinos for different triangle configurations and shapes, and apply it to a case compatible with a Stage-IV spectroscopic survey. We also compare our results with the analysis of simulations without neutrinos, but with different $\sigma_8$ values, to test whether the 3PCF can break the well-known degeneracy between the two parameters. We find that, as a result of free-streaming, the largest signal is found for quasi-isosceles and squeezed triangles; this signal is increasing for decreasing redshifts. Among these configurations, elongated triangles, tracing the filamentary structure of the cosmic web, are the most affected by the impact of massive neutrinos, with a 3PCF signal increasing with $M_\nu$. A complementary source of signal comes from right-angled triangles in $Q$. Importantly, we find that the signatures of a $\sigma_8$ variation appear significantly different on elongated triangles in $\zeta$ and right-angled triangles in $Q$, suggesting that the 3PCF can be used to effectively break the $M_\nu - \sigma_8$ degeneracy. These results open the possibility to use the 3PCF as a powerful complementary tool to constrain neutrino masses in current and future spectroscopic surveys like DESI, Euclid, 4MOST, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Divergent Evolution of Io and Europa as Primordial Ocean Worlds</a><span class="id">[2512.17004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Galilean moons exhibit a decrease in bulk density with distance from Jupiter, which may reflect differences in evolutionary paths and water loss. Early in its history, Jupiter was more luminous and may have driven substantial atmospheric escape on Io and Europa. We investigate whether Io could have lost its water inventory while Europa retained its volatiles, assuming both moons initially accreted hydrous silicates. The formation and early thermal evolution of the protosatellites are modeled using an interior evolution model coupled with an atmospheric escape framework. Dehydration timescales and volatile losses for Io and Europa are computed during their early evolution, accounting for accretional heating from both satellitesimal and pebble accretion, as well as irradiation from Jupiter's primordial luminosity. Europa likely retained most of its volatiles under nearly all plausible formation and evolution scenarios, as large-scale dehydration would have taken place only after the first 10 Myr of its evolution. In contrast, Io was unlikely to lose a substantial amount of water through atmospheric escape and therefore probably accreted predominantly anhydrous silicates. If Europa initially accreted hydrous minerals, the present-day volatile contrast between Io and Europa could be explained by their relative locations with respect to the phyllosilicate dehydration line in the Jovian subnebula. Distinct evolutionary pathways or atmospheric escape processes alone appear insufficient to reproduce the observed differences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The contribution from smalls scales on two-point shear analysis: comparison between power spectrum and correlation function</a><span class="id">[2512.17022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A known problem in cosmic shear two-point statistics is the apparent inconsistency between analyses performed in harmonic space (power spectrum) and real space (angular correlation). This arises mainly from two factors: first, scale cuts in one space correspond to soft cuts in the other, as the relationship between the two spaces is mediated by Bessel functions. For the same reason, astrophysical effects that are compact in one space may not be in the other, which can lead to biased parameter estimates. In this paper, we argue that these two statistics are complementary: we expect a robust theory to provide consistent constraints regardless of the chosen scale cuts. We present the consequences of pushing our analysis to smaller scales in both spaces, accounting for different models of Intrinsic Alignment and Baryonic Feedback in HSC Y3 data: we find that the harmonic-space analysis is significantly less sensitive to the specific modeling of small-scale physics, with model-choice-driven biases in $S_8$ being 2-3 times smaller than in real space. We show that using a flexible, simulation-based emulator for baryonic feedback (BACCO) in combination with the TATT model for intrinsic alignments provides the most consistent cosmological constraints between the two spaces when pushing to the smallest scales. In contrast, the standard HMCode-2016 model results in a $\sim 1.1\sigma$ tension between the two statistics. While harmonic space appears more robust for cosmological inference given current model uncertainties, real-space analyses offer a clearer separation of baryonic effects and will play a crucial role in distinguishing between baryonic feedback models in upcoming surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The mass distribution of clumpy accretion onto the nearby young star TW Hya</a><span class="id">[2512.17074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The proliferation of high time-resolution and decades-long monitoring of classical T Tauri stars provides a vast opportunity to test the variability of the star-disk connections. However, most monitoring surveys use single broad-band filters, which makes the conversion of photometric variability into accretion rate difficult. In this study, we analyze accretion bursts onto the nearby young star TW Hya over short (hours, days) and long (months, years) timescales by calibrating TESS and ASAS-SN $g$-band photometry to accretion rates with simultaneous spectroscopy. The high cadence TESS light curve shows bursts of accretion in clumps with masses from a sensitivity limit of $\sim10^{-13}$ M$_\odot$ up to $3\times 10^{-11}$ M$_\odot$. The average burst duration of 1.8 days is longer than a simple estimate of the thermal response timescale, supporting the interpretation that the photometric variability probes the instantaneous accretion rate. The reset timescale of 1.2–2 days derived from the structure function and previously reported quasi-periods of 3.5–4 days are consistent with bursts that may be related to the different rotation between the stellar magnetosphere and inner disk or with azimuthal asymmetries in the inner disk. The near-daily ASAS-SN light curve across 8 years reveals some seasonal changes in brightness with a standard deviation of $\sim 0.13$ mag, about half of the scatter seen on short timescales. This study demonstrates the importance of coordinating contemporaneous multi-epoch spectroscopy with time domain surveys to interpret light curves of young stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational wave oscillations in Multi-Proca dark energy models</a><span class="id">[2512.17088]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave oscillations arise from the exchange of energy between the metric perturbations and additional tensor modes. This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO–Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \sim \mu_A$, where $\mu_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field. Detectability of gravitational wave oscillations, however, requires $m_g \gg H_0$, which is in tension with the ultra-light masses typically needed to drive accelerated expansion $\mu_A \sim H_0 \sim 10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, if gravitational wave oscillations were to be detected at the corresponding frequencies, they could not be attributed to these classes of dark-energy models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A VERITAS view of HESS J1857+026 within a multi-wavelength analysis</a><span class="id">[2512.17184]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HESS J1857+026 remains a mysterious gamma-ray emitter since its discovery in 2008. Despite the disclosure of a nearby pulsar and multiple studies in the high-energy (HE, E &gt; 100 MeV) and very-high-energy (VHE, E &gt; 100 GeV) regimes, there have been no confirmed counterparts (e.g., an SNR shell or other extended structure) in X-ray or other wavelengths. We present the result of our study of the VHE emission of HESS J1857+026 with VERITAS as part of a multi-wavelength investigation to uncover its emission mechanisms. Our result confirms the extended nature of the source and we characterize its spectral and morphological features in the VHE band. Using the morphology of the source revealed in our analysis, we also explore the underlying transport process of a possible electron population in a leptonic PWN scenario for the gamma-ray emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Near-Earth Object Model Calibrated to Earth Impactors</a><span class="id">[2512.17191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The population of Earth-impacting meteoroids and its size-dependent orbital elements are key to understanding the origin of meteorites and informing on planetary defence efforts. Outstanding questions include the role of collisions in depleting meteoroids on highly evolved orbits and the relative importance of delivery resonances. Those depend on size, with current dynamical models considering only asteroids larger than 10m in diameter. Based on 1,202 sporadic meteoroids observed by the Global Fireball Observatory, we created a debiased model of the near-Earth meteoroid population in the 10g - 150kg in size (approximately 1cm - 0.5m) as they dynamically evolved from the main asteroid belt onto Earth-crossing orbits. The observed impact population is best matched with a collisional half-life decreasing from 3Myr for meteoroids of 0.6kg (7cm) or higher, to 1Myr below this size, extending to the model lower bound of 10g. Placing our results in context with near-Earth object models for larger sizes, we find that the inner main belt continues to dominate feeding the small 1m to 10m diameter population primarily via the $\nu_6$ secular resonance and the 3:1J mean motion resonance. We also evaluated the potential significance of physical processes other than collisions on Earth-impacting meteoroids, such as low-perihelion disruptions from thermal stresses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Nanohertz Gravitational Wave Background with an X-ray Pulsar Timing Array from NICER observations</a><span class="id">[2512.17201]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present constraints on the nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB) using X-ray pulsar timing data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer(\textit{NICER}). By analyzing six millisecond pulsars over a six-year observational baseline, we employed a Bayesian framework to model noise components and search for a common red signal consistent with a GWB from supermassive black hole binaries (assuming a spectral index $\gamma_{\rm gwb}=13/3$). Our results show no significant evidence for a GWB, yielding a 95\% upper limit of $\log_{10}(A_{\rm gwb})&lt;-13.4$. Weak evidence for Hellings-Downs spatial correlations was found (S=2.5), though the signal remains statistically inconclusive. Compared to radio and $\gamma$-ray pulsar timing arrays, the \textit{NICER} constraint is currently less stringent but demonstrates the feasibility of X-ray timing with \textit{NICER} for GWB studies and highlights the potential for improved sensitivity with future X-ray missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsed radio emission from a Central Compact Object</a><span class="id">[2512.17214]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The high magnetic fields and rapid spins of young pulsars associated with supernova remnants, such as the Crab and the Vela, established the standard pulsar model in which massive stellar explosions produce rapidly rotating, radio-luminous neutron stars. Central Compact Objects (CCOs), identified in X-rays at the centers of other remnants, challenged this view, as decades of searches yielded no radio detections. Here we show that the prototypical young CCO 1E 1207.4-5209 is in fact a faint radio pulsar rotating at the 0.4s X-ray period. Analysis of its polarization indicates that the radio beam intersects our line of sight near the magnetic pole, affirming its radio faintness' being intrinsic. Once its supernova remnant dissipates, this source would be misidentified as an apparently gigayear-old pulsar. The CCO's low radio flux density may explain why many supernova remnants lack detectable radio pulsars and suggests a hidden population of young, slowly rotating neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncovering the population of compact binary mergers and their formation pathways with gravitational waves through the Einstein Telescope</a><span class="id">[2512.17339]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) observatories have transformed our view of compact-object mergers, yet their reach still limits a comprehensive reconstruction of the processes that generate these systems. Only next-generation observatories, with order-of-magnitude improvements in sensitivity and access to lower frequencies, will be capable of radically extending this detection horizon. GW observations will make it possible to detect the complete population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers out to redshifts of $z \simeq 100$. This capability will deliver an unprecedented map of merger events across cosmic time and enable precise reconstruction of their mass and spin distributions, while for several thousand events the signal-to-noise ratio will surpass 100, enabling precision physics of BHs and neutron stars (NSs). The access to lower frequencies will also open the intermediate-mass window, detecting systems of order $\sim 10^3 M_\odot$, potentially in coordination with multi-band observations from LISA. At higher redshifts, where Population III stars have so far remained beyond reach - even for the James Webb Space Telescope - GW observations by next-generation detectors will routinely provide observations of BH mergers thought to originate from these primordial stellar populations. Such measurements are expected to play a central role in clarifying the early assembly of supermassive black holes. A single detection of a binary BH system at $z \gtrsim 30$, or of a compact object with sub-solar mass and no tidal deformability, would constitute strong evidence for the existence of primordial black holes. Such a discovery would have profound consequences for our understanding of dark matter and the early Universe. Ultimately, the GW observations will become revolutionary for identifying the physical channels responsible for compact binary formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prediction of the Solar Polar Fields in 2026: An Unusually Weak Level Across the Last Five Solar Cycles</a><span class="id">[2512.17359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar polar fields are essential for the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field. Cycle 25 is now entering its declining phase, the critical period during which most of the cycle's polar fields are established. Therefore, reliable polar-field prediction is now especially important. Polar-field evolution is governed by the poleward transport of already-emerged active-region (AR) flux over a timescale of a few years. Thus, surface flux-transport models can reliably provide one-year predictions without requiring information about future AR emergence. Our prediction method is validated using simulations of the surface magnetic field from 2020-2025 and hindcasts of the 2023-2024 polar fields, employing a newly constrained profile of the meridional flow. Using the most recent HMI synoptic magnetogram as the initial condition, we predict the polar-field evolution from October 2025 to October 2026. The southern polar field is predicted to strengthen gradually, while the northern field is expected to decline sharply until March 2026 due to some ARs with abnormal polarity. By that time, the northern polar field becomes exceptionally weak, and the southern field remains relatively weak, raising concerns about the polar-field strength at the cycle 25/26 minimum and the amplitude of cycle 26.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantifying sunspot group nesting with density-based unsupervised clustering</a><span class="id">[2512.17364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sunspot groups often emerge in spatial-temporal clusters, known as nests or complexes of activity. Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\langle D\rangle = 0.61 \pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Signatures of a Possible New Physics Resonance in Atmospheric Air Showers Using a Parameterized Model</a><span class="id">[2512.17441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a parameterized model of atmospheric particle showers initiated by cosmic rays. Few physics shower parameters are tuned in a comparison to the Conex generator. Resulting shower properties are studied, with a comment on the cases where multiple shower maxima develop. Finally, we implement simple models of new physics resonance of masses of 100 GeV and 1 TeV and examine their effects on the shower profile, depth and maximum variation in dependence of the decay channel of the hypothetical resonance. It is shown that a new resonance effects can appear at the energy threshold and can persist for about a decade in $\log_{10} E/\mathrm{eV}$. Various assumed decay modes of the hypothetical resonance have different effects on the direction and shape of the modified average shower depth as function of the energy, with possible implications for current or future measurements. It is shown that, within the presented model, the visibility of the resonance in modified shower depth strongly depends on the resonance width. A significant modification at 10\% width gradually diminishes towards the percent-level width. We propose that looking at the 2D distributions of the two first individual shower moments can also reveal signatures of new physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A search for late-type brown dwarfs in the Euclid Quick Data Release 1</a><span class="id">[2512.17494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the identification and characterization of 15 mid-to-late T dwarf candidates in the Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1) dataset, based on a combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis.

From an initial pool of 38,845 sources, we extracted low-resolution near-infrared spectra from the Euclid NISP instrument and applied a two-stage validation procedure that included spectral template fitting followed by visual inspection. Eight of the 15 validated candidates are newly identified objects with no prior literature association. We examined their morphological and photometric properties and compared them with established spectral standards. Photometric distances were derived using band-averaged distance modulus estimates. We discuss the limitations and promise of the Euclid survey for ultracool dwarf studies, and demonstrate the potential for discovering substellar populations beyond the reach of current wide-field surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Resolution Measurements with the CTAO Southern Array: The Case for Pulsar Wind Nebulae</a><span class="id">[2512.17498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The advent of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) and recent advances in reconstruction of gamma-ray photons with Cherenkov telescopes are bound to push the limit of angular resolution to an unprecedented precision of less than one arcminute at tens of TeV. Naturally, such instrumental improvements open up possibilities for new and interesting scientific studies. We aim to show that the study of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) in particular is bound to profit from these high-resolution measurements. This is because PWNe are the dominant Galactic source population at TeV energies, exhibit hard spectra up to hundreds of TeV and from X-ray observations are known to possess plentiful structure on arcminute scales. Using HESS J1813-178 and MSH 15-52 as examples, we create simple leptonic models of the TeV morphology of these sources based on X-ray observations and existing gamma-ray measurements. Then, assuming different models for the exposure and point spread function of the observatory, we create mock observations with the future CTAO southern array. We use these to assess the ability of these observations to differentiate between models and study the physics of these sources, in particular to infer the structure of the magnetic field and electron distributions. We find that future observations with the CTAO southern array at multi-TeV energies - in combination with existing X-ray measurements - will likely be able to constrain the distributions of magnetic field and high-energy electrons in these sources. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of these measurements can be significantly enhanced with the improved angular resolution achievable with novel reconstruction algorithms. However, we also show that in the relevant multi-TeV regime, signal-photon statistics remain a limitation and trading event statistics for improved angular resolution is not necessarily advantageous.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio studies of supernovae 1979C, 1986J and 2006X with LOFAR</a><span class="id">[2512.17520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) studies of supernovae SN 1979C, SN 1986J, and SN 2006X, focusing on new observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) and the International LOFAR Telescope (ILT). For Type Ia SN 2006X, we derive a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.7 mJy at 0.146 GHz, and using radio emission models based on the CS15DD2 explosion model, we constrain the circumstellar density to $n_{\rm H} \lesssim 10$ cm$^{-3}$ for the microphysical parameters $\epsilon_{\rm rel} = \epsilon_{\rm B} = 0.01$. SN 1979C is clearly detected in the LoTSS image with a flux density of $4.6 \pm 0.36$ mJy nearly 40 years postexplosion. Modeling its radio evolution suggests a steep flux decay ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-2.1}$) between 22 and 42 years, a break in the spectrum near 1.5 GHz possibly due to synchrotron cooling, a progenitor mass of $\sim 13$ solar masses, and a progressive steepening with velocity for the density slope of the supernova ejecta. Our findings for SN 1979C contradict scenarios involving central compact object emission, and we obtain X-ray temperatures close to those derived from recent observations. For SN 1986J, we present the first ILT image showing a flux density of $6.77\pm0.2$ mJy at 0.146 GHz. The spectral index of the shell emission is found to be $0.66\pm0.03$, consistent with previous estimates, although variations at low frequencies warrant further investigation.

These observations span three epochs: 2002 and 2006 with XMM-Newton alone, covering the $0.3-10$ keV energy range, and a coordinated XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observation in 2016, covering the $0.3-60$ keV energy range. The X-ray spectra across all epochs exhibit both neutral and ionized absorption, along with reflection features from the accretion disc, including a prominent Compton hump in the broadband data. Notably, the spectral shape varies across epochs. Our analysis suggests this variability is attributed to changes in both line-of-sight absorption and the intrinsic emission from PG 1535+547. The source is obscured by multiple layers of partially and/or fully covering neutral and ionized absorbers, with neutral column densities ranging from undetectable levels in the least obscured phase to $\sim0.3-5\times10^{23}\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ in the most obscured phase. A clear warm absorber is revealed during the least obscured phase. The continuum remains fairly consistent ($\Gamma\approx 2.2\pm0.1$) during the first two observations, followed by a substantial flux decrease (by a factor of $\sim7$ in the $2-10$ keV band) in 2016 compared to 2006. The 2016 data indicates the source is in a reflection-dominated state during this epoch, with a reflection fraction of $R&gt;7$ and an X-ray source located at a height $\leq 1.72r_g$. Simultaneous fitting of the multi-epoch data suggests a rapidly rotating black hole with a spin parameter, $a&gt;0.99$. These findings imply that strong light-bending effects may account for the observed continuum flux reduction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Validating the performance of the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland using cosmic-ray air showers</a><span class="id">[2512.17664]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) is currently under construction with the aim to detect neutrinos with energies beyond $\sim 10\,\mathrm{PeV}$. A critical part of early detector commissioning is the study of detector characteristics and potential backgrounds, for which cosmic rays play a crucial role. In this article, we report that the number of cosmic rays detected with RNO-G's shallow antennas is consistent with expectations. We further verified the agreement in the observed cosmic-ray signal shape with expectations from simulations after careful treatment of the detector systematics. Finally, we find that the reconstructed arrival direction, energy, and polarization of the cosmic-ray candidates agrees with expectations. Throughout this study, we identified detector shortcomings that are mitigated going forward. Overall, the analysis presented here is an essential first step towards validating the detector and high-fidelity neutrino detection with RNO-G in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolving and interacting dark energy: photometric and spectroscopic synergy with DES Y3 and DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2512.17684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the Dark Scattering (DS) interacting dark energy scenario, characterised by pure momentum exchange between dark matter and dark energy, allowing for a time-dependent equation-of-state described by the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrisation.

We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models.

A relevant background to the astrophysical flux is prompt atmospheric neutrinos, originating from the decay of charmed mesons produced in cosmic-ray-induced air showers. The production rate of charmed mesons in the very forward phase space of hadronic interactions, and consequently, the prompt neutrino flux, remains uncertain and has not yet been observed by neutrino detectors. An accurate measurement of this flux would enhance our understanding of fundamental particle physics such as hadronic interactions in high-energy cosmic-ray-induced air showers and the nucleon structure. Furthermore, an experimental characterization of this background flux will improve the precision of astrophysical neutrino flux spectral measurements. In this work, we perform a combined fit of cascade-like and track-like neutrino events in IceCube to constrain the prompt atmospheric neutrino flux. Given that the prompt flux is a sub-dominant contribution, treating systematic uncertainties arising from the potential mis-modeling of the conventional and astrophysical neutrino fluxes is critical for its measurement. Our analysis yields a non-zero best-fit result, which is, however, consistent with the null hypothesis of no prompt flux within one standard deviation. Consequently, we establish an upper bound on the flux at $4\times 10^{-16}$ (GeV m$^2$ s sr)$^{-1}$ at 10 TeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Selected topics on: 1) proposal of interpreting the Crab supernova with a GRB 2) progress in identifying the seven GRBs episodes 3) the role of Sagittarius A in identifying the dark matter component (the X fermion)</a><span class="id">[2512.17787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the fiftieth anniversary of our common effort in the field of relativistic astrophysics is approaching, we offer a new look to some of our acquired knowledge in a more complete view, which evidence previous unnoticed connections.

We adopt a catalog-based pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimator and apply linear imaging weights validated on noiseless mocks.

These observed loops are in turn structured into bright strands. We investigate the relationship between magnetic field geometry, plasma properties and bright strands with the help of a 3D resistive MHD simulation of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistent convection zone layer. We find that it is impossible to identify a loop as a simple coherent magnetic flux tube that coincides with plasma of nearly uniform temperature and density. The location of bright structures is determined by a complex interplay between heating, cooling and evaporation timescales. Current sheets form preferentially at the interfaces of magnetic flux from different sources. They may also form within bundles of magnetic field lines since motions within magnetic concentrations drive plasma flows on a range of timescales that provide further substructure and can locally enhance magnetic field gradients and thus facilitate magnetic reconnection. The numerical experiment therefore possesses aspects of both the flux tube tectonics and flux braiding models. While modelling an observed coronal loop as a cylindrical flux tube is useful to understand the physics of specific heating mechanisms in isolation, it does not describe well the structure of a coronal loop rooted in a self-consistently evolving convection zone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equilibriums of extremely magnetized compact stars with force-free magnetotunnels</a><span class="id">[2303.17874]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present numerical solutions for stationary and axisymmetric equilibriums of compact stars associated with extremely strong magnetic fields.

Originally formulated by Rarita and Schwinger, the relativistic theory of a massive spin-3/2 field later found a home in supergravity as the superpartner of the graviton, and in nuclear physics as baryonic resonances and nuclear isotopes. We study a minimal model realization, namely a free massive spin-3/2 field minimally coupled to gravity, and adopt the name raritron for this field. We demonstrate that CGPP of raritrons crucially depends on the hierarchy between the raritron mass $m_{3/2}$ and the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_e$, with high-mass and low-mass cases distinguished by the evolution of the sound speed $c_s$ of the longitudinal (helicity-1/2) mode, which is approximately unity at all times for heavy (relative to Hubble) raritrons and can become small or vanish for lighter raritrons, leading to a dramatic enhancement of production of high momentum particles in the latter case. Assuming the raritrons are stable, this leads to a wide parameter space to produce the observed dark matter density. Finally, we consider a time-dependent raritron mass, which can be chosen to remove the vanishing sound speed of the longitudinal mode, but which nonetheless enhances the production relative to the constant high-mass case, and in particular does not necessarily tame the high momentum tail of the spectrum. We perform our calculations using the Bogoliubov formalism and compare, when applicable, to the Boltzmann formalism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermion Thermal Field Theory for a Rotating Plasma (with Applications to Neutron Stars)</a><span class="id">[2512.16993]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper provides a systematic and complete study of thermal field theory with fermion fields of any kind for generic equilibrium density matrices, which feature arbitrary values not only of temperature and chemical potentials, but also average angular momentum.

A general technique to compute ensemble averages is provided. Path-integral methods are developed to study thermal Green's functions (with an arbitrary number of points) in generic interacting fermion-scalar theories, which cover both the real-time and imaginary-time formalism. These general results are applied to physical situations typical of neutron stars, which are often quickly rotating: the Fermi surface and Fermi momentum, the average energy, number density and angular momentum for degenerate fermions and particle production (such as neutrino production from rotating neutron stars, e.g. pulsars). In particular, it is shown that the neutrino production rate due to the direct URCA (DU) processes grows indefinitely as the angular velocity approaches the inverse linear size of the plasma and, therefore, rotation can significantly increase this rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deviations from Gaussian White Noise in Stochastic Inflation</a><span class="id">[2512.17070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stochastic inflation is widely used as a framework to study scalar field perturbations on an inflationary spacetime in a classical manner. In Starobinsky's seminal work and most of the subsequent literature, stochastic inflation is driven by a white noise. This is a consequence of a number of assumptions about the background metric, the window function, and the initial state. Given that noise is the central object in this approach, it is worthwhile to investigate how the noise is modified upon relaxing some of these assumptions. We show that while deviation from an exact de Sitter background maintains the white character of the noise (only with a time-dependent amplitude), deviation from the Heaviside window function or the Bunch-Davies initial state can produce colored noise. We calculate the power spectrum and the memory of the noise for a toy model with a piecewise linear window function. We also show that, in order to produce a colored noise, the deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum should essentially be a sum of two-particle states. The resulting noise is non-stationary and we find its instantaneous power spectrum in a concrete example. Furthermore, while deviations from de Sitter background and sharp cutoff do not affect Gaussianity, changing the initial state yields a non-Gaussian noise.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost-free 2-form fields in cosmology: implications for gravitational parity violation</a><span class="id">[2512.17348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the possibility of parity-violating, nonminimally coupled 2-form field theories that retain the same dynamical degrees of freedom as a massive 2-form and thus are ghost-free.

However, we also find that parity-violating terms involving the dual 2-form field can be absorbed into a field redefinition, leaving a theory with essentially the same structure as that obtained by Heisenberg and Trenkler (i.e., the parity-preserving coupling to the double dual Riemann tensor). After the field redefinition, the only place where parity-violating terms can appear is in the potential. We then consider a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological model with an isotropic configuration of a triplet of 2-form fields, and study tensor perturbations in this setup.

The spacetime geometry, characterized by the BH mass and the coupling parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$, includes exponential and oscillatory corrections arising from the Lee-Wick terms. Using the effective potential approach, we derive specific energy, angular momentum, epicyclic frequencies, and the locations of the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of test particles. In addition to the analytical analysis, we explore the effects of the Lee-Wick spacetime parameters on the shock-cone morphology produced by Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion. To this end, we perform general relativistic hydrodynamic simulations in two characteristic regimes: Block-1 (weak Lee-Wick regime) and Block-2 (strong Lee-Wick regime). The results show that Block-1 solutions closely resemble the Schwarzschild case, while Block-2 models develop denser and asymmetric shock cones accompanied by stronger QPOs activity, shifting from low-frequency to high-frequency QPOs. These variations yield distinct observational signatures that may be detectable in high-resolution X-ray timing data. Our analytical and numerical findings demonstrate that the Lee-Wick parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$ cause measurable changes in the morphology of the accretion flow and in the frequency ratios near the BH. This suggests that future multi-wavelength observations could provide an important avenue to test higher-derivative gravity theories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinetic-Theory Bounds on the Equation of State of Dense QCD Matter</a><span class="id">[2512.17410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive bounds on the equation of state of cold, dense matter by extending the causal, model-agnostic interpolation between chiral effective field theory and perturbative calculations with a microscopic constraint from relativistic kinetic theory.

Whilst much of the post-discovery literature has focused on its astrophysical origins, primary analyses have exhibited considerable discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models, which cannot reliably be reproduced by simulations. Such discrepancies may arise when an unaccounted overlapping signal is present in the data, or from phenomena that produce similar effects, such as gravitational lensing or overlapping noise artifacts. In this work, we analyse GW231123 using a flexible model that allows for two overlapping signals, and find that it is favoured over the isolated signal model with Bayes factors of $\sim 10^2 - 10^{4}$, depending on the waveform model. These values lie within the top few per cent of the background distribution. Similar effects are not observed in GW190521, another high-mass event. Under the overlapping signals model, discrepancies in the measurement of source properties between waveform models are largely mitigated, and the two recovered sources show similar properties. Additionally, we find that neglecting an additional signal in overlapping-signal data can lead to discrepancies in the estimated source properties resembling those reported in GW231123.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum state of interacting primordial inhomogeneities: de-squeezing and decoherence</a><span class="id">[2512.17622]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how interactions affect the quantum state of scalar perturbations during inflation and the quantum correlations they may exhibit.

We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baryogenesis and EDMs in the 2HDM+CS</a><span class="id">[2512.17695]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We perform the first joint analysis of baryogenesis from initial Higgs charges (also called Higgsogenesis) and EDMs in a model with two Higgs doublets, a complex scalar and a Majorana fermion. In our proposed scenario, baryogenesis happens in three steps: (1) The decay of the scalar produces an asymmetry between the two Higgs doublets which is partly transferred to fermions via Standard Model processes. (2) This asymmetry is converted into a $B-L$ charge via interactions mediated by the Majorana fermion. (3) The weak sphaleron processes partially convert the resulting $B-L$ charge into a $B$ asymmetry. We perform a numerical analysis of baryogenesis and the EDM contributions and find that, due to resonant enhancement, baryogenesis is possible with singlet masses as low as $10^5$ GeV. We also find that for some parameters, the model can give large contributions to the electron and neutron EDM while also producing baryogenesis. The present scenario offers a new perspective on interpreting observational bounds in terms of cosmology: Because it relies on out-of-equilibrium decays, the questions of baryogenesis and $CP$ violation in the Higgs sector may be linked with EDM signals without the additional assumption of a first order electroweak phase transition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boiling away asymmetries: low-scale phase transitions, gravitational waves and leptogenesis</a><span class="id">[2512.17707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Leptogenesis is one of the most popular mechanisms to account for the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe. A generic feature of leptogenesis is a large separation of scales between the epoch of baryon asymmetry production (sphaleron freeze-out at temperature $T \sim 130$ GeV) and the one where it affects the big bang nucleosynthesis processes (BBN at $T \sim 1$ MeV). Any entropy release between these two epochs would lead to a dilution of previously produced relics, such as the baryons. Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational waves background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency range, we consider the case of supercooled first-order phase transition and we study the impact of the induced entropy dilution on the leptogenesis parameter space. We employ the Type-I seesaw with 2 right-handed neutrinos as benchmark scenario, and demonstrate that the viable leptogenesis parameter space is significantly reduced. Interestingly, the values of dilution predicted by the SGWB best fit points in several first order phase transition scenarios would completely exclude the leptogenesis parameter space testable by future experiments, thus establishing a phenomenological interconnection between leptogenesis, SGWB, first order phase transition and neutrino mass generation.

The resulting entropy relation contains, beside the standard Bekenstein-Hawking term, an additional integral contribution that encodes the effective energy density and pressure generated by deviations from general relativity. Using this universal entropy formula, a compact expression for the GSL is derived. This formalism is then applied to some viable $f(T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity models, in order to re-evaluate the validity of the GSL as a function of redshift.

The presence of a companion can dramatically impact both the cloud's evolution and the binary's orbital dynamics, generating a trail of feedback effects that require detailed modelling. Using a worldline effective field theory approach, we develop a systematic framework for binaries on generic (eccentric and inclined) orbits, capturing both resonant and non-resonant transitions without relying solely on balance laws. We demonstrate the existence of “co-rotating” floating orbits that can deplete the cloud prior to entering the detector's band, triggering eccentricity growth towards a sequence of fixed points. Likewise, we show that “counter-rotating” orbits can also deplete the cloud, driving (unbounded) growth of eccentricity. Furthermore, we uncover novel features tied to orbital inclination. Depending on the mass ratio, equatorial orbits can become unstable, and fixed points may arise not only for aligned or anti-aligned configurations but, strikingly, also at intermediate inclinations. We derive flow equations governing spin-orbit misalignment and eccentricity and identify distinctive signatures that can reveal the presence of boson clouds in the binary's history, as well as key features of possible in-band transitions. These results refine and extend earlier work, yielding a more faithful description of the imprints of ultralight particles in gravitational-wave signals from binary black holes, signatures that are within reach of future detectors such as LISA, Cosmic Explorer, and the Einstein Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.08003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisit the periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts with updated sample</a><span class="id">[2205.08003]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since FRB 200428 has been found to be associated with an X-ray burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154, it is interesting to explore whether the magnetar bursts also follow the similar active periodic behavior as some repeating FRBs. Previous studies show that there is possible period about 230 day in SGR J1935+2154 bursts. Here, we collected an updated burst sample from SGR J1935+2154, including all bursts reported by Fermi/GBM and GECAM till 2022 January. We also developed a targeted search pipeline to reveal more bursts from SGR J1935+2154 in the Fermi/GBM data from 2008 August to 2014 December (i.e. before the first burst detected by Swift/BAT). With this burst sample, we re-analyzed the possible periodicity of SGR J1935+2154 bursts using the Period Folding and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram methods. Our results show that the periodicity $\sim$238 day reported in literature is probably fake and the observation effects may introduce false periods (i.e. 55 day) according to simulation tests. We find that, for the current burst sample, the most probable period is 126.88$\pm$2.05 day, which could be interpreted as the precession of the magnetar. However, we note that the whole burst history is very complicated and difficult to be perfectly accommodated with any period reported thus far, therefore more monitoring observations of SGR J1935+2154 are required to test any periodicity hypothesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear Hall effect in the stationary cylinder with a radial heat flux</a><span class="id">[2304.13630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A conducting cylinder with a uniform magnetic field along its axis and radial temperature gradient is considered at the stationary state.

Accordingly, these systems could dominate GW emission in the micro- and millihertz frequency range. Within this domain, SMBHs evolve rapidly and merge with each other. Dynamical friction from stars and gas at the centers of galaxies typically helps to bring together two SMBHs when they are at relatively far separations ($\approx$ kpc $-$ 100 pc), but becomes less efficient at smaller separations. However, dark matter (DM) spikes around SMBHs could enhance dynamical friction at close separations and, thus, shorten the evolution times. In this paper, we simulate the effects of DM spikes on GW signals in the micro- to millihertz frequency range and confirm that the GW signals from SMBHBs with DM spikes can be clearly distinguished from those without any additional matter. Making use of the projected sensitivity curve of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we forecast upper limits for the (dark) matter density for given future SMBHB observations. We then compare these thresholds with the theoretical density profiles expected for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) spikes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Novel Quantity for Probing Matter Perturbations Below the Fresnel Scale in Gravitational Lensing of Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2503.15066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational lensing of gravitational waves provides a powerful probe of the mass density distribution in the universe. Wave optics effects, such as diffraction, make the lensing effect sensitive to the structure around the Fresnel scale, which depends on the gravitational wave frequency and is typically sub-Galactic for realistic observations. Contrary to this common lore, we show that wave optics can, in principle, probe matter perturbations even below the Fresnel scale. This is achieved by introducing a new quantity derived from the amplification factor, which characterizes the lensing effect, and analyzing its correlation function. Our results demonstrate that this quantity defines an effective Fresnel scale: a characteristic scale that can be arbitrarily small, even when observational frequencies are bounded. In practice, the effective Fresnel scale is constrained by the observation time $T$ and is suppressed by a factor of $1/\sqrt{fT}$ relative to the standard Fresnel scale at frequency $f$. Nevertheless, it remains significantly smaller than the conventional Fresnel scale for $fT \gg 1$; for instance, in one-year observations of mHz GWs, the effective Fresnel scale can be as small as 1 pc. This approach opens new avenues for probing the fine-scale structure of the universe and the nature of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baryon Acoustic Oscillations in tomographic Angular Density and Redshift Fluctuations</a><span class="id">[2504.15506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we examine the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in 2D angular and redshift space $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$, with $\Delta z$ denoting the redshift difference between two given angular shells. We thus work in the context of tomographic analyses of the large scale structure (LSS) where data are sliced in different redshift shells and constraints on Cosmology are extracted from the auto and cross-angular spectra of two different probes, namely the standard galaxy angular density fluctuations (ADF, or 2D clustering), and the galaxy angular redshift fluctuations (ARF). For these two observables we study by first time how the BAO peak arises in the $\{\theta, \Delta z\}$ plane. Despite being a weak feature (particularly for $\Delta z \neq 0$), a Fisher forecast analysis shows that, a priori, most of the information on cosmological and galaxy bias parameters is carried by the BAO features in shell auto- and cross-angular power spectra. The same study shows that a joint probe analysis (ADF+ARF) increases the Fisher determinant associated to cosmological parameters such as $H_0$ or the Dark Energy Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ by at least an order of magnitude. We also study how the Fisher information on cosmological and galaxy bias-related parameters behaves under different redshift shell configurations: including cross-correlations to neighbour shells extending up to $(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.6$ ($(\Delta z)^{\rm tot}\sim 0.4$) for ADF (ARF) is required for Fisher information to converge. At the same time, configurations using narrow shell widths ($\sigma_z \leq 0.02$) preserve the cosmological information associated to peculiar velocities and typically yield Fisher determinants that are about two orders of magnitudes larger than for wider shell ($\sigma_z&gt;0.02$) configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the phenomenologically emergent dark energy model: is non-zero equation of state of dark matter favored by DESI DR2?</a><span class="id">[2506.09819]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of dark matter remains one of the most fundamental and unresolved questions in modern cosmology. In most cosmological models, dark matter is typically modeled as pressureless dust with an equation of state (EoS) parameter $w_{\rm dm} = 0$. However, there is no fundamental theoretical reason to exclude the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS parameter. In this work, we explore the possibility of a non-zero dark matter EoS within the phenomenologically emergent dark energy (PEDE) model, given its simplicity and proven ability to alleviate the Hubble tension. We perform observational constraints by using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck, and the type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus. From our analysis, we observe that a negative dark matter EoS parameter is preferred in all scenarios. Specifically, the CMB+DESI+DESY5 data yields $w_{\mathrm{dm}} = -0.00093 \pm 0.00032$, deviating from zero at approximately the $3\sigma$ level. However, this deviation is likely driven by unidentified systematics or inconsistencies in the DESY5 data, with the deviation decreasing to $2\sigma$ when using PantheonPlus data. Meanwhile, a negative $w_{\rm dm}$ would increase the Hubble tension due to the positive degeneracy between $w_{\rm dm}$ and $H_0$. Furthermore, Bayesian evidence suggests that the $\Lambda$CDM model is strongly preferred over the PEDE+$w_{\rm dm}$ model. These analyses illustrate that it is not possible to both support a non-cold dark matter component within the PEDE model and alleviate the Hubble tension simultaneously.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J-PAS: Forecasting constraints on Neutrino Masses</a><span class="id">[2507.03740]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The large-scale structure survey J-PAS is taking data since October 2023. In this work, we present a forecast based on the Fisher matrix method to establish its sensitivity to the sum of the neutrino masses. We adapt the Fisher Galaxy Survey Code (FARO) to account for the neutrino mass under various configurations applied to galaxy clustering measurements. This approach allows us to test the sensitivity of J-PAS to the neutrino mass across different tracers, with and without non-linear corrections, and under varying sky coverage. We perform our forecast for two cosmological models: $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ and $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$. We combine our J-PAS forecast with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data from the Planck Collaboration and Type Ia supernova (SN) data from Pantheon Plus. Our analysis shows that, for a sky coverage of 8,500 square degrees, J-PAS galaxy clustering data alone will constrain the sum of the neutrino masses to an upper limit at 95% C.L of $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.32$ eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.36$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. When combined with Planck data, the upper limit improves significantly. For J-PAS+Planck at 95% C.L, we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.061$ eV for the $\Lambda CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model, and for J-PAS+Planck+Pantheon Plus, we obtain $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.12$ eV for the $w_0w_a CDM + \sum m_\nu$ model. These results demonstrate that J-PAS clustering measurements can play a crucial role in addressing challenges in the neutrino sector, including potential tensions between cosmological and terrestrial measurements of the neutrino mass, as well as in determining the mass ordering.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGR J17091-3624: Newly Formed Periodic Dips and Multiwavelength Activity During the 2025 Outburst</a><span class="id">[2508.17307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The black hole low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) candidate IGR J17091-3624 experienced a hard-state-only outburst in 2025. In this paper, we show that IXPE detected a series of intermittent X-ray dips, spanning a total interval of  1 day. Subsequent observations with NICER, EP, NuSTAR, and Swift reveal that these dips recur with a period of 2.83$\pm$0.07 days and are accompanied by an increase in spectral hardness. This is the first time such quasi-periodic dipping behavior has been observed in this target since discovery. Our spectral analysis shows that the dips can be explained by obscuration from an ionized absorber characterized by an ionization parameter of $log{\xi}$  1-3 erg cm s$^{-1}$ and an equivalent hydrogen column density of $N^{\rm zxipcf}_{\rm H}$ (1-30)$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The periodic reappearance of the absorber is likely caused by obscuring material located in the outer accretion disk, modulated by the binary orbital period. If confirmed, this period would suggest that the donor star in IGR J17091-3624 has deviated from the standard main-sequence evolutionary path and is likely a (partially) stripped giant. In the optical band, no significant periodicity or correlation with the X-ray dips was detected, whereas the radio counterpart exhibited a flat to steep spectrum, in contrast to the inverted spectrum typically observed during the hard state of LMXBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Picohertz Gravitational Waves with Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2508.21582]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With periods much longer than the duration of current pulsar timing surveys, gravitational waves in the picohertz (pHz) regime are not detectable in the typical analysis framework for pulsar timing data.

In this work, we present the results of the first Bayesian search for continuous pHz gravitational waves using the drift of two sensitive pulsar timing parameters – time derivative of pulsar binary orbital period $\dot{P}_b$ and second order time derivative of pulsar spin period $\ddot{P}$. We apply our new technique to a dataset with more than double the number of pulsars as previous searches in this frequency band, achieving an order-of-magnitude sensitivity improvement. No continuous wave signal is detected in current data; however, we show that future observations by the Square Kilometre Array will provide significantly improved sensitivity and the opportunity to observe continuous pHz signals, including the early stages of supermassive black hole mergers. We explore the detection prospects for this signal by extending existing population models into the pHz regime, finding that future observations will probe phenomenologically-interesting parameter space. Our new Bayesian technique and leading sensitivity in this frequency domain paves the way for new discoveries in both black hole astrophysics and the search for new physics in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Supernova Project: Fast-Declining Type Ia Supernovae as Cosmological Distance Indicators</a><span class="id">[2509.07093]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, the suitability of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is examined utilizing a Hubble Flow sample of 43 of these objects observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). We confirm previous suggestions that fast-declining SNe Ia offer a viable method for estimating distances to early-type galaxies when the color-stretch parameter, $s_{BV}$, is used as a measure of the light curve shape. As a test, we employ the Tripp method, which models the absolute magnitude at maximum as a function of light curve shape and color. We calibrate the sample using 12 distance moduli based on published Infrared Surface Brightness Fluctuations to derive a value of the Hubble constant that is in close agreement with the value obtained for the full sample of CSP SNe Ia using the same methodology. We also develop a new and simple method of estimating the distances of fast decliners based only on their colors at maximum (and not light curve shape) and find that it leads to similar results as with using the Tripp method. This &quot;Color&quot; technique is a powerful tool that is unique to fast-declining SNe Ia. We show that the colors of the fast decliners at maximum light are strongly affected by photospheric temperature differences and not solely due to dust extinction, and provide a physical rationale for this effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation of the Galactic Center in the Sub-MeV Gamma-Ray Band with an Electron-Tracking Compton Camera</a><span class="id">[2509.15851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the direct detection of gamma-ray emission from the Galactic center in the 150–600 keV band using the electron-tracking Compton camera (ETCC), which has a wide field of view of 3.1 sr and represents the first application of this linear, imaging-spectroscopy method to observations of the Galactic center. A one-day flight over Australia resulted in a significant gamma-ray detection in the light curve and revealed a $7.9\sigma$ excess \revise{over the background} in the image map from the Galactic center region. These results, obtained through a simple and unambiguous analysis, demonstrate the high reliability and sensitivity of the ETCC and establish its potential for future high-precision MeV gamma-ray observations. The measured intensity and spatial distribution were tested against three emission models: a single point-like source, a multi-component structure, and a symmetric two-dimensional Gaussian. All models were found to be statistically consistent with the data. The positronium-related flux in the multi-component model is $(3.2~\pm~1.4)~\times~10^{-2}$ photons cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, which is approximately a factor of two higher than the value reported by INTEGRAL, with a discrepancy at the $2\sigma$ level.

Its properties include possible periodicity in its gamma-ray light curve, an X-ray counterpart that rose prior to the gamma-ray outbursts and faded quickly, and radio and infrared counterparts. These features are difficult to reconcile with most models of high energy transients but we show that they are compatible with a white dwarf bound to an intermediate mass black hole that is tidally stripped over multiple pericentre passages before being fully disrupted. Accretion onto the black hole powers a mildly relativistic jet that produces the X-rays through internal processes and the infrared and radio counterparts through thermal emission and external shocks respectively but is unable to produce the gamma-ray emission on its own. We propose that chaotic debris streams from the multiple stripping episodes can collide with a period roughly the same as the orbital period of the star. These shocks produce hard X-ray photons that are upscattered by the jet to produce the observed MeV gamma-ray emission. Future analysis of the jet properties will allow us to place firmer constraints on our model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Dark Energy Meets Varying Electron Mass: Implications for Phantom Crossing and the Hubble Constant</a><span class="id">[2510.21931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the interplay between varying electron mass ($m_e$) and dynamical dark energy by analysing the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization and its non-crossing variants, both with and without a varying-$m_e$ component. Our aim is to assess whether the preference for late-time dynamics and phantom divide line (PDL) crossing persists when early-time physics is introduced, and whether these combined models improve the alleviation of the Hubble tension compared to the varying-$m_e$ extension alone. Using the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova datasets, we derive updated constraints on $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and their extensions, and examine their impact on $H_0$ and the preference for late-time dynamics. We find that $\Lambda$CDM+$m_e$ yields the largest upward shift in $H_0$, while replacing $\Lambda$ with the CPL parametrization or its non-crossing variants provides modest improvements in the overall fit. The data consistently favour dynamical dark energy and a phantom divide line crossing at scale factors $a_{\rm c}\simeq0.6-0.9$, and these preferences remain robust, though somewhat weaker ($\gtrsim2\sigma$), when the electron mass is also allowed to vary. Among the late-time models, CPL performs better than its non-crossing variants, further reinforcing the evidence for a genuine phantom divide crossing. The alleviation of the $H_0$ tension in the varying-$m_e$ case arises from late-time data breaking the strong $\Omega_m$-$m_e$ degeneracy in the CMB, while the additional degrees of freedom in CPL models allow the late-time dynamics to absorb this impact, thereby weakening the degeneracy breaking and further lowering $H_0$ through their ability to yield a decreasing dark energy contribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A volcanic chronosequence as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to study the cosmic-ray flux in the Late Pleistocene and Holocene</a><span class="id">[2510.23126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a phenomenological study demonstrating the feasibility of using olivine xenoliths from the Chaîne des Puys as a time-resolved paleo-detector array to probe the cosmic-ray flux over the last 40,000 years.

The SN was discovered and classified just 12h post-explosion via the GOTO-FAST high-cadence program. Optical spectroscopy, photometry, and polarimetry over 220d chart the complex, long-lived interaction in this transient. Early evolution is dominated by CSM interaction, showing a 14d rise to a peak absolute magnitude of g=-17.6 mag, with clear flash-ionisation signatures. SN2024cld also shows a slowly-evolving late time light curve powered by CSM interaction, with high-velocity (6000 km/s) shoulders on a strong multi-component H-alpha profile. Dense polarimetric coverage reveals marked evolution in the photospheric geometry – peaking at p=2% 10 days post-explosion, and rotating approx. 60 deg as the ejecta sweep more distant CSM.

We propose the filaments arose from the Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable nature of the interface between the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the shocked wind launched by the natal WD; the filaments then elongated intact due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-stable nature of the large initial density contrast between the wind and CSM, supplemented by the slowly declining wind density profile (relative to homologously expanding ejecta). To support this interpretation, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and derive the filament properties, including their speed, density, and temperature, all of which are consistent with observations. We suggest the filaments elongate until the wind and CSM densities become comparable at the contact discontinuity, which occurs within 1–10 years, and then truncate because the RTI halts. The subsequent KHI growth timescale across the current width of the filaments is longer than the age of Pa 30, so they remain intact. The filament-less central region in Pa 30 is therefore more likely a consequence of the finite timescale over which the RTI operates, rather than a wind termination shock. In general, firework-like filaments may form in other systems, provided there is a sufficiently large density contrast between the ejecta and its surroundings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary relics from an Ultra-Slow-Roll plateau</a><span class="id">[2512.04986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in inflationary scenarios featuring an ultra-slow-roll (USR) plateau, focusing on two coexisting production channels: PBHs originating from relic vacuum bubbles where the inflaton got trapped on the plateau, and PBHs arising from standard adiabatic density perturbations. From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels.

Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised. Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it. Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary. Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates. Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Polarized X-ray Universe: Insights and Discoveries</a><span class="id">[2512.11488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarization is one of the fundamental natures of electromagnetic radiation. The detection of polarization or polarized photons from distant X-ray radiating systems (such as X-ray binaries (XBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), pulsars, and stars) complements the timing, spectral, and imagining analysis to better understand the physical mechanisms taking place in these sources. Polarization has enhanced the understanding of the internal geometry of these systems and their vicinity. Polarized X-rays can be generated either directly through non-thermal physical processes in the presence of a magnetic field(B) or through the scattering of unpolarized thermal radiation within plasma structures such as an accretion disk. X-ray polarization can measure the two important independent parameters, the polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA) of the X-ray photons. These parameters are crucial as they reveal the characteristics of particles in such a strong magnetic and gravitational field. In this chapter, we have discussed (i) the basic idea of polarization, (ii) some distant sources radiating polarized X-ray photons, (iii) missions dedicated to observing polarized X-ray photons, and (iv) recent breakthroughs and upcoming missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inference of Neutron Star Mass Distributions and the Equation of State from Multi-messenger Observations</a><span class="id">[2512.12130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a combined model to incorporate neutron star (NS) mass measurements with electromagnetic mass-radius constraints and gravitational-wave observations using Bayesian inference. We use different mass distributions for three populations depending on the companion stars: double neutron stars, NS - white dwarfs, and low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB). To observe the effects of different parametrizations, we use two equation of state (EoS) models: a piecewise polytrope and a fixed sound-speed model at high densities in combination with a low-density EoS. Our results show that the mass distributions of these NS populations are distinct and sensitive to the EoS prior choices. In addition, we show for the first time that using a uniform prior on the observable NS maximum mass, rather than a nuisance parameter in the unknown high-density EoS, shifts the posterior maximum mass to larger values. For polytropic EoSs, the maximum mass posterior changes from $M_\mathrm{max}=2.09_{-0.07}^{+0.18} M_\odot$ to $2.15_{-0.10}^{+0.19} M_\odot$ at 90% confidence level. This change in prior also impacts the shape of the mass distribution for NSs in LMXB, shifting the posterior for the population mean from $1.51_{-0.13}^{+0.13} M_\odot$ to $1.62_{-0.12}^{+0.15} M_\odot$ at 68% confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comprehensive Interpretation of Fermi-LAT Pulsars: Fundamental-Plane Death Border, Visibility Thresholds, and GeV-TeV Unification</a><span class="id">[2512.15065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a framework that links equatorial-current-sheet (ECS) physics to catalog-level, phase-averaged gamma-ray pulsar properties. Guided by analytic scalings and particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar “Fundamental Plane” (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\dot{\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\dot{\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\dot{\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\gamma\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\mu^\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts a MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Systematic biases in parameter estimation on LISA binaries: The effect of excluding higher harmonics for non-spinning binaries</a><span class="id">[2502.12237]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The remarkable sensitivity achieved by the planned Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will allow us to observe gravitational-wave signals from the mergers of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the hundreds, or even thousands. At such high SNR, our ability to precisely infer the parameters of an MBHB from the detected signal will be limited by the accuracy of the waveform templates we use. In this paper, we explore the systematic biases that arise in parameter estimation if we use waveform templates that do not model radiation in higher-order multipoles. This is an important consideration for the large fraction of high-mass events expected to be observed with LISA. We examine how the biases change for MBHB events with different total masses, mass ratios, and inclination angles. We find that systematic biases due to insufficient mode content are severe for events with total redshifted mass $\gtrsim10^6\,M_\odot$. We then compare several methods of predicting such systematic biases without performing a full Bayesian parameter estimation. In particular, we show that through direct likelihood optimization it is possible to predict systematic biases with remarkable computational efficiency and accuracy. Finally, we devise a method to construct approximate waveforms including angular multipoles with $\ell\geq5$ to better understand how many additional modes (beyond the ones available in current approximants) might be required to perform unbiased parameter estimation on the MBHB signals detected by LISA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards model-independent identification of lensed gravitational waves using Kramers-Kronig relation</a><span class="id">[2504.21320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of microlensed gravitational waves (GWs) emanated by compact binary coalescences (CBCs) are essential for studying the mass density distribution in the universe, including black holes and dark matter halos. However, no confident detection of microlensed GWs have been reported to date. There are two important challenges in the identification of microlensed GWs. The first is that the source waveform and lens structure models are not known a-priori. The second is that certain classes of unlensed GWs could mimic microlensed GWs, resulting in undesirable false alarms. In this work, we propose to use the Kramers-Kronig relation for gravitational lensing systems. We argue that such systems are essentially linear response systems obeying causality, where KK relation must hold. The power of this method lies in the fact that microlensed GWs, regardless of the lens structure, must obey KK relation, while unlensed GW events are not in general expected to obey it. This, in principle, allows us to identify microlensed GWs while dismissing microlensing mimickers. We provide the first important steps towards a methodology that exploits KK relation, and test its usefulness under idealized conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black hole formation in k-inflation models</a><span class="id">[2507.02490]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The local primordial density fluctuations caused by quantum vacuum fluctuations during inflation grow into stars and galaxies in the late universe and, if they are large enough, also produce primordial black holes.

Using a quasiclassical Boltzmann transport calculation of the dark matter production, we compute the nonthermal phase space distributions of sterile neutrinos across a broad range of particle mass $m_s$ and mixing angle $\sin^2{(2\theta)}$ parameter space. We then evolve the resulting distributions through linear structure formation using CLASS and fit the resulting matter power spectra to thermal warm dark matter (WDM) transfer functions, enabling a direct mapping between SF models and equivalent thermal WDM particle masses $m_{\mathrm{th}}$. This allows us to reinterpret existing structure formation limits and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest preferences in the context of SF production. We find that lepton asymmetries $L \gtrsim 0.5$ at high temperatures open significant viable parameter space in the $m_s \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ and $\sin^2 (2\theta) \lesssim 10^{-14}$ regime, compatible with both x-ray constraints from NuSTAR and INTEGRAL/SPI and recent Lyman-$\alpha$ inferences of $m_{\mathrm{th}} \approx 4.1\,\mathrm{keV}$. Following lepton number evolution below 20 MeV, we also specifically show that this lepton asymmetry parameter space is compatible with BBN and cosmic microwave background constraints. We present updated constraints, a refined $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ fitting function, and power-law approximations for $L$ across the parameter space. Our results motivate future x-ray observations targeting the $\sim\! 20\,\mathrm{keV}$ photon regime and testing of the $m_\mathrm{th} \gtrsim 10\,\mathrm{keV}$ WDM region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Compact Story of Positivity in de Sitter</a><span class="id">[2508.08359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent developments have yielded significant progress towards systematically understanding loop corrections to de Sitter (dS) correlators. In close analogy with physics in Anti-de Sitter (AdS), large logarithms can result from loops that can be interpreted as corrections to the dimensions of operators. In contrast with AdS, these dimensions are not manifestly real. This implies that the theoretical constraints on the associated correlators are less transparent, particularly in the presence of light scalars. In this paper, we revisit these issues by performing and comparing calculations using the spectral representation approach and the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET). We review the general arguments that yield positivity constraints on dS correlators from both perspectives. Our particular focus will be on vertex operators for compact scalar fields, since this case introduces novel complications. We will explain how to resolve apparent disagreements between different techniques for calculating the anomalous dimensions for principal series fields coupled to these vertex operators. Along the way, we will offer new proofs of positivity of the anomalous dimensions, and explain why renormalization group flow associated with these anomalous dimensions in SdSET is the same as resumming bubble diagrams in the spectral representation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves induced by matter isocurvature in general cosmologies</a><span class="id">[2509.02122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The expansion history and content of the Universe between the end of inflation and the onset of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is mostly unknown.

We analytically compute the induced GW kernel and analyze the spectral GW energy density for a sharply peaked isocurvature power spectrum. We show that the spectral shape of the GW signal is sensitive to the equation of state parameter $w$ of the perfect fluid dominating the early Universe after inflation.

We focus on vector mediators, including neutrinophilic, gauged $L_\mu\!-\!L_\tau$, and $B\!-\!L$ realizations that modify in-medium dispersion and scattering, thereby altering the active-sterile conversion history. Building on a novel production framework with NSI thermal potentials and collision integrals, we compute nonthermal phase-space distributions across sterile neutrino mixing and NSI parameters and map each point to an equivalent thermal warm dark matter particle mass $m_\mathrm{th}$ via linear-theory transfer function fitting with cosmological structure-formation Boltzmann solver. This enables a direct reinterpretation of state-of-the-art structure-formation limits from Milky Way satellites, strong lensing, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These limits, in conjunction with X-ray decay searches, as well as results from a wide variety of particle physics experiments allow for a more complete examination of these models. We find that these vector-mediated models are ruled out when the full combination of current constraints, listed above, are taken into account.

While the majority of those applications require the knowledge of PSF of mid-mass and heavy nuclei, there is now renewed interest in $E1$ strength distributions of light nuclei in the framework of the PANDORA project, which aims at an understanding of the mass distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic radiation (UHECR).UHECR is of extragalactic origin and its interaction along the travel path is dominated by photoabsorption of cosmic background radiation boosted to the Giant Dipole Resonance (GDR) energy region in the center-of-mass system. Thus, systematic knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections in light nuclei and of their subsequent particle decay is required. The purpose of this work is to enhance the database of available theoretical evaluations of PSF of light nuclei that are necessary in the studies of UHECR propagation. We employ the Configuration Interaction Shell Model (CI-SM) approach to provide predictions of $E1$ dipole response for $p$ and $sd$-shell nuclei, with mass number $A$ between 7 and 40. Theoretical predictions are compared to available data and to existing predictions from phenomenological and microscopic models. Finally, the impact of using of CI-SM PSF on the predicted propagation of a $^{40}$Ca UHECR source is studied.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiral magnetic effect amplified baryogenesis at first-order phase transitions</a><span class="id">[2512.16537]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we show that, in the background of the primordial magnetic field, the chiral magnetic effect effect can significantly amplify the chiral chemical potential sourced by the CP violation near the bubble walls during the first-order electroweak phase transition.
