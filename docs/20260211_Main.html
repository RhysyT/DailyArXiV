Their uniformity is credited to their single origin as thermonuclear explosions of White dwarf (WD) stars. Nevertheless, some SNe Ia break this regularity. Prominently, the Iax subclass are less energetic and remarkably diverse, raising questions about their progenitor systems. While no progenitor system of a normal SN Ia has ever been detected, a luminous blue star was identified in pre-explosion images of the site of the bright SN Iax SN 2012Z, suggested to be a helium giant companion star acting as a mass donor to a WD SN progenitor. This is in line with models of weak mass accretion of a WD from a binary companion, producing an explosion that does not fully disrupt the star. However, these models fail to explain the properties of the faintest Type Iax explosions, suggesting either they originate from other WD binary systems, or even from massive progenitor stars. Here, we present the faint SN Iax SN 2024vjm - possibly the faintest supernova observed to date. Using a deep pre-explosion image taken by the recently launched Euclid space mission, we show that its progenitor system must be fainter than the helium giant SN Iax progenitor candidate of SN 2012Z, as well as that of the luminous red companion or remnant of the faint SN 2008ha, and may require a subdwarf helium star as a mass donor. The deep image also provides strong arguments against a massive star origin for this faint supernova. Our observations argue that SN 2024vjm is a WD explosion, but we find that remarkably faint SNe Iax fade more slowly than bright ones, i.e., they evolve in an opposite manner from the famous Phillips relation that makes regular SNe Ia cosmological candles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization Signatures of Inspiraling Hotspots around Kerr Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2602.09102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarimetric interferometry is a powerful tool for probing both black hole accretion physics and the background spacetime. Current models aimed at explaining the observed multiwavelength flares in Sgr A* often assume hotspots moving on geodesic, Keplerian orbits. In many scenarios, though, a hotspot may instead follow an inspiraling trajectory, potentially transitioning into a plunge toward the black hole. In this work, we present a general framework to simulate the polarized emission from generic equatorial inspiraling hotspots in Kerr spacetime using a parametric four-velocity profile. This parametrization defines a continuous family of flows, ranging from Cunningham's disk model (fixed radius orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and plunging motion within the innermost stable circular orbit) to purely radial motion, thereby extending the standard assumptions. Within this framework, we show that inspiral motion produces a distinctive observational signature: a precessing, unwinding evolution of the polarimetric Stokes Q-U looping pattern, in sharp contrast with the closed Q-U loops associated with stable orbits at a fixed radius. We then explore how the morphology of these signatures depends on black hole spin, observer inclination, and magnetic-field configuration. The presented model can be applied to current and near-future interferometric observations of linear polarization, offering a new avenue to probe the physics of matter spiraling inward and the relativistic velocities of plunging plasma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous Gravitational Waves from Supersoft X-ray Sources: Promising Targets for deci-Hz Detectors</a><span class="id">[2602.09124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) host white dwarfs (WDs) accreting at rates that sustain steady nuclear burning, driving rapid mass growth, radial contraction, and magnetic field amplification. Angular-momentum transfer from the accretion disk naturally spins up the WD, while the amplified internal magnetic field induces a non-axisymmetric deformation in presence of a misaligned rotation. Such WDs emits continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We model the coupled evolutions of stellar mass, spin, and magnetic structure in accreting WDs in SSSs with \texttt{MESA}, and compute the resulting quadrupolar deformation with the Einstein-Maxwell solver \texttt{XNS}. We show that WDs in SSSs, particularly near the end ofthermal timescale mass transfer and close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, produce CGWs predominantly in the deci-Hz band accessible to planned detectors such as DECIGO, BBO, Deci-Hz, ALIA, and LGWA, and are distinguishable from other Galactic CGW sources such as AM CVn systems, detached double WDs, and isolated WDs. Well-studied SSSs such as CAL 83 and RX J0019+2156 can be detectable, enabling targeted CGW measurements that directly probe WD's internal magnetic fields and rotation, while blind searches can reveal hundreds of obscured SSSs otherwise missed in soft X-rays and map the hidden population of accreting, rapidly rotating, magnetized WDs in nearby galaxies. A CGW detection from WDs in SSSs could also identify potential pre-explosion Type Ia progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits on the Post-eclipse Emission Spectrum of HD 80606 b From High-Resolution Spectroscop</a><span class="id">[2602.09129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Keck/NIRSPEC $K$-band observations of HD 80606 b, one of the most eccentric known exoplanets. HD 80606 b was observed after secondary eclipse, close to periastron, when the planet passes within 0.03 AU of HD 80606 and the rapid heating of the atmosphere may lead to extreme chemical changes and a temporary thermal inversion. The rapid change in the planetary radial velocity near periastron is sufficient to enable high-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) analysis, which produces a tentative detection ($\rm SNR\sim4$) of HD 80606 b. Injection-recovery tests appear to reject strong thermal inversions near periastron, consistent with recent results from JWST. We also perform atmospheric retrievals with free parameters for the Pressure-Temperature ($P-T$) profile and with a profile matched to the JWST results, which suggest the presence of absorption features from CH$_4$ and CO. While HD 80606 b is not definitively detected in these data, these results are consistent with JWST observations, which found the post-eclipse atmosphere of HD 80606 b shows weak absorption features from these species. Future observations with higher spectral resolution and/or wider wavelength coverage are needed for a confident atmospheric detection of HD 80606 b via high-resolution spectroscopy alone, but such observations are a challenge to schedule due to the 111-day orbital period.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Y Dwarf Population with HST: unlocking the secrets of our coolest neighbours – III. Near-Infrared Photometry</a><span class="id">[2602.09160]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Y dwarfs represent the coldest class of brown dwarfs, with effective temperatures below 500K, and provide unique analogues to cold giant exoplanets. We present a large compilation of uniform near-infrared photometry from the Hubble Space Telescope for 21 Y dwarfs across multiple WFC3/IR filters, including the F105W, F125W and F160W bands. We employed refined PSF-fitting and calibration procedures to reach photometric uncertainties at the 0.02-0.05 mag level for most targets. Combined with precise parallax measurements, our data reveal well-defined Y-dwarf sequences in near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams, observed with a markedly improved tightness. Known photometric trends emerge with minimal scatter, including the continuous redward progression in F125W-F160W with decreasing temperature, and the blueward trend in F105W-F125W with possible hints of a reversal around 350K. Comparisons to the ATMO, Sonora Elf Owl, and Lacy &amp; Burrows atmospheric models highlight systematic discrepancies, in particular F105W-F125W and F105W-F160W colours predicted to be too red. Low-metallicity grids provide the best fits to the global Y-dwarf population, although closer inspection across wavelengths shows that these preferences likely reflect compensating effects in missing or incomplete physics rather than true population-level abundances. While some atmospheric diversity is expected among Y dwarfs, their tight observational sequences and systematic offsets from model predictions reveal that key physical and chemical processes remain inadequately captured in current grids. Our results underscore the importance of high-precision, internally consistent datasets in robustly tracing the Y-dwarf cooling sequence and providing the empirical constraints needed to advance theoretical models at the lowest temperatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unipolarity of the solar magnetic field in equatorial coronal holes</a><span class="id">[2602.09199]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A study of the unbalanced magnetic polarity distribution of 70 coronal holes was performed. Data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) were used to examine the photospheric line-of-sight magnetic field ($B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$) beneath these coronal holes. The skewness ($S$) values of the $B_{\mathrm{LOS}}$ distributions revealed significant asymmetry, characterized by the dominance of one magnetic polarity, with $\sim88\%$ of the coronal holes exhibiting a skewness value ranging from $\pm(0.20~\text{to}~0.40)$. The corresponding magnetic flux imbalance ($\Phi_{\mathrm{imb}}$) ranges from $20\%$ to $45\%$. In contrast, quiet-Sun regions show symmetric magnetic field distributions with skewness values less than$~0.11$ and flux imbalance less than $11.0\%$. A study of a coronal hole as it traverses across the disk shows that the magnetic field distribution does not evolve significantly over this time, remaining stable across half a solar rotation. A moderate correlation ($r = 0.60$) between the magnetic flux imbalance and the speed of associated high speed solar wind streams ($v_{\mathrm{HSS}}$) suggests that flux imbalance may contribute to the generation of these faster solar wind streams. These results imply that regions with higher flux imbalance ($\Phi_{\mathrm{imb}}$), indicative of more open magnetic field structures, present more favorable conditions for plasma acceleration as compared to closed bi-polar field, but the moderate correlation indicates that other factors may also play important roles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterisation of starspot structure and differential rotation of Kepler-411</a><span class="id">[2602.09224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Starspots and their movements on stellar surfaces enable investigating the mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity. Information on the spot distribution and differential rotation provide important constraints for the behaviour of stellar magnetic dynamos. We analyse the Kepler photometry of Kepler-411, a known exoplanet host, to determine the distribution and properties of star spots on the stellar surface with two independent and complementary methods: modelling the photometric effect of rotation of spots on the stellar surface and mapping of spots by transiting planets. By constructing a spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation and spot evolution, we model the spots of the stellar surface giving rise to the observed brightness variations. We also search for evidence for occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry. Our spot models reproduce the observed photometric variations well and we are able to obtain information on the distribution and movement of spots on the stellar surface. We do not obtain evidence for differential rotation – the rotational profile is consistent with rigid-body rotation with a period of 10.52$\pm$0.34 days. We detect three occultations of spots by planet c. The positions of these spots coincide well with the positions of larger spot structures identified by our modelling of the rotational modulation of the light curve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09230" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Redshift Uncertainties in Roman Weak Lensing Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2602.09230]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological constraints using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Roman Space Telescope will require a powerful method for modelling uncertainties in the galaxy redshift distribution. In this work, we use an optimized version of the principal component analysis (PCA) to model uncertainties in the full shape of the redshift distributions, a method proposed by \cite{pca_method} and recently used in the Dark Energy Survey Y6 analysis. Here, we implement this new approach within the Roman High Latitude Imaging Survey (HLIS) Cosmology Project Infrastructure Team (PIT) pipeline, namely Cobaya-Cosmolike Joint Architecture (\texttt{CoCoA}). To validate the PCA in mitigating biases on cosmological parameters, $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$, we use a set of redshift distributions from \texttt{Cardinal} generated for a variety of Roman configurations. Overall, when the simulated cosmic shear data vector is not strongly miscalibrated relative to the fiducial one, both the mean-shift and the PCA-based approaches produce consistent cosmological constraints when marginalizing over nuisance parameters. For mild to strong miscalibration, including additional PCs progressively mitigates biases in $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$, and can achieve comparable performance with fewer parameters than the nine tomographic-bin mean-shift model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of Hyperion and Saturn's Rings in A Two-Stage Saturnian System Instability</a><span class="id">[2602.09281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The age of the rings and some of the moons of Saturn is an open question, and multiple lines of evidence point to a recent (few hundred Myr ago) cataclysm involving disruption of past moons. The main driver of the evolution of the Saturnian system is the relatively rapid tidal expansion of its largest moon, Titan, which is likely driven by resonant tides within Saturn. The obliquity of Saturn and the orbit of the small moon Hyperion both serve as a record of the past orbital evolution of Titan. Saturn's obliquity was likely generated by a secular spin-orbit resonance with the planets, while Hyperion is caught in a mean-motion resonance with Titan, with both phenomena driven by Titan's orbital expansion. We propose that the breaking of Saturn's spin resonance was also the event in which Hyperion formed, when an outer mid-sized satellite (“Proto-Hyperion”) was destabilized and collided with Titan, with some of the debris accreting into Hyperion. During the instability Proto-Hyperion's perturbations produced the observed orbital inclination of Iapetus. The same event also excited the eccentricity of Titan, which then, through Titan's resonant interaction with the inner moons, led to destabilization, collisional disruption and re-accretion of the inner moon system, including the rings. We present numerical integrations that show that this chain of events has a relatively high probability, and discuss how it fits within our knowledge of the Saturnian system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital Period Changes of Recurrent Nova T Pyxidis Demonstrate that M_ejecta &gt;&gt; 11.3xM_accreted and Is Not a Type Ia Supernova Progenitor</a><span class="id">[2602.09377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recurrent nova (RN) T Pyxidis (T Pyx) has a complex history of mass accreting-onto and ejection-from the white dwarf, with a classical nova eruption around 1866 kick-starting a RN-phase with six RN eruptions from 1890–2011. T Pyx is a primary progenitor candidate for Type Ia supernovae (SNIa). This is chiefly a question of whether the mass accreted by the white dwarf ($M_{\rm accreted}$) is more-or-less than the mass ejected by the nova eruptions ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) over the entire eruption cycle. Prior attempts to measure $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from the traditional methods have a scatter of $&gt;$130$\times$, so only a new technique can provide a measure of adequate accuracy and reliability. This new technique is the timing experiment of measuring the orbital period from 1986 to 2025, where the period increased by $+$50.3$\pm$7.9 parts-per-million across the 2011 eruption. With simple and sure physics, the best estimate for the mass ejected by one RN event is $&gt;$2400$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an extreme inviolate limit of $\gg$354$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over all eruptions in a cycle, $M_{ejecta}$$&gt;$17120$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$, with an inviolate limit of $M_{ejecta}$$\gg$2144$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. Over the full eruption cycle, the white dwarf accreted 220$\times$10$^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$. So M$_{\rm ejecta}$$\gg$11.3$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, and T Pyx can never become a SNIa. This paper is the seventh in a series proving that each of various popular candidate SNIa progenitors cannot possibly evolve to a supernova; including V445 Pup, U Sco, T CrB, all symbiotic stars, FQ Cir, V1405 Cas, and now T Pyx.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09390" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectroscopic He I 1083 nm prominence eruption observations in the middle corona with MLSO/UCoMP</a><span class="id">[2602.09390]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a major driver of space weather as they propagate through the heliosphere. Many CMEs have associated prominence material entangled in their magnetic structure which contains cooler plasma. This cooler CME component contains significant amounts of neutral elements, which emit brightly in permitted atomic lines. It has been hypothesized that permitted transitions of neutral elements in eruptions could be used for inferring the magnetic field in CMEs, which is crucial for space weather forecasting. We present observations made with the Upgraded Coronal Multi-channel Polarimeter (UCoMP) in He I 1083 nm that clearly show the presence of neutral helium in eruptive prominences associated with CMEs as they propagate through the lower and middle corona. We find that solar prominence eruptions can be detected in He I 1083 nm observations up to the edge of the instrument field of view at about 2 solar radii, providing valuable spectral information that complements existing extreme ultraviolet and white-light coronal imaging observatories. These results illustrate the capability of UCoMP to probe the dynamic behavior of prominence eruptions, allowing for their line-of-sight velocity estimation, and potentially improving space weather forecasting by enabling earlier and more accurate identification of Earth-directed eruptions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass-Radius Constraints for 2S 0918-549 from an RXTE Superexpansion Burst: A Direct Cooling-Tail Analysis</a><span class="id">[2602.09400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thermonuclear (Type I ) X-ray bursts from accreting neutron stars offer a means to determine neutron-star (NS) mass ($M$) and radius ($R$) and thereby probe the properties of matter at supranuclear density. A subset of these events, photospheric radius-expansion (PRE) bursts, provide a particularly powerful tool to constrain the neutron-star $M$ and $R$. Here, we apply the direct cooling-tail method to 2S 0918$-$549, using a rare superexpansion burst observed by \emph{RXTE}. We fit only the post-touchdown data within \(F/F_{\rm td}\in[0.6,0.95]\), employing modern atmosphere models (pure He and metal-enriched). The pure-He atmosphere yields a good description of the cooling tail (\(\chi^{2}/\nu=18.12/14\)), whereas metal-rich models fail; information-criterion tests (AIC/BIC) disfavor adding a free absorption edge in every time bin, indicating that heavy-element ashes are unnecessary. The joint fit gives a distance \(d=4.1-5.3\) kpc and mass-radius constraints \(M=1-2\,M_\odot\) and \(R=9.7-11.9\) km (99\% confidence). These results suggest that representative families of both gravity-bound and self-bound equations of state remain viable at the $1\sigma$ confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The compositions of the HR 8799 planets reflect accretion of both solids and metal-enriched gas</a><span class="id">[2602.09422]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With four giant planets ($m\sim5-10~M_{\rm Jup}$, $T_\rm{eff}\sim900-1200$ K) orbiting between 15-70 au, HR 8799 provides an unparalleled testbed for studying giant planet formation and probing compositional trends across the protoplanetary disk. We present new JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations ($2.85-5.3~\mu$m, $R\approx2700$) that now include the spectrum of HR 8799 b, and higher S/N spectra for HR 8799 c, d, and e compared to that in Ruffio &amp; Xuan et al. 2026. We detect CO, CH$_4$, H$_2$O, H$_2$S, CO$_2$, and for planet b, NH$_3$. We combine the NIRSpec spectra with $1-5 \mu$m photometry to perform atmospheric retrievals that account for disequilibrium chemistry and clouds, and allow C/H, O/H, N/H, and S/H to scale independently. While the four planets are similarly enriched in carbon and oxygen, with C/H and O/H between $3-5\times$ stellar, we observe a tentative trend of increasing S/H - a tracer of refractory solids - from $2-5 \times$ stellar with increasing orbital distance. From HR 8799 b's NH$_3$ abundance, we estimate $\rm N/H=21.2^{+16.2}_{-8.8}\times$ stellar, suggesting the outer planet accreted significant amounts of N-rich gas. Overall, the elemental abundance patterns we observe are consistent with a picture where planet b formed between the CO snowline and the more-distant N$_2$ snowline, while the inner planets accreted $3 \times$ stellar CO-enriched disk gas within the CO snowline. The excess volatile mass from pebble drift and evaporation implies an integrated pebble flux of $750 \pm 200~M_{\oplus}$. The increase in the planets' S/H with orbital distance implies more solid accretion further out, which is quantitatively compatible with expectations from both pebble and planetesimal accretion ($2 \times$ Minimum Mass Solar Nebula) paradigms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Systematic Study of the Simultaneous Events Detected by GECAM</a><span class="id">[2602.09544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GECAM is a constellation of all-sky monitors in hard X-ray and gamma-ray band primarily aimed at high energy transients such as gamma-ray bursts, soft gamma-ray repeaters, solar flares and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.

However, the properties and origin of STE have not yet been explored. In this work, we implemented, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of the STE detected by GECAM, including their morphology, energy deposition, and the dependence on the geomagnetic coordinates.

We investigate the timing and spectral properties of the Seyfert galaxy Mrk 110 using six XMM-Newton observations. A frequency-dependent lag analysis in the 7-9 $\times 10^{-5}$ Hz range reveals a soft X-ray lag of 889-3000s in the combined 2019 data, detected with a significance of 80%. The cross-correlation function analysis, supported by simulations, also detects lags of similar nature. Spectral modeling performed by adopting both proposed black hole masses in the literature for Mrk 110 confirms the presence of a warm corona in all observations, along with a weak relativistic reflection component and the reflection fraction remains low (Rf &lt; 1). Interpreting the measured soft lag in terms of light travel time implies an emission radius 4.5 Rg for a supermassive black hole mass of $M = 1.4 \times 10^8$ solar mass , favoring a reflection scenario. However, if a lower mass of $M = 2 \times 10^7$ solar mass is adopted, the inferred radius increases, and both relativistic reflection and warm Comptonization can plausibly contribute to the observed soft lag. The warm corona radius appears larger in the high accretion state and smaller in a lower accretion state, although no trend can be established. The persistently low reflection fraction suggests an outflowing inner corona in Mrk 110, consistent with the recent detection of jet activity in this source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio from a modified Lennard-Jones inflationary potential</a><span class="id">[2602.09599]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The increasingly stringent observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves strongly constrain inflationary model building, favoring scenarios that predict highly suppressed tensor perturbations. While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$\sigma$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3's Dust Trail as a Source of Pickup Ions</a><span class="id">[2602.09601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is a short-period comet that has undergone multiple fragmentation events in the last few decades. During May-June 2006, while passing near Earth, multiple fragments of comet 73P passed sunward of Sun-Earth Lagrange Point 1, while cometary pickup ions were detected concurrently by instruments on both the ACE and Wind spacecraft, implying the crossing of one or more ion tail. Additionally, during August 2011, a fragment of 73P passed directly sunward of spacecraft STEREO-B. A detection of cometary ions is shown to originate at fragment 73P-AM. Solar wind velocity measurements are used to extrapolate the flow of the solar wind in 3 dimensions and, when compared with the positions of known comets and cometary fragments, estimate the separation between the cometary ion tail and the spacecraft. Using this technique, it is shown that the alignment of the major cometary fragments with the spacecraft was poor for the transport of cometary ions via the solar wind, but the encounter was near enough for immersion in the diffuse ion tail surrounding an extended dust trail within which the nucleus fragments reside. This implies that, at this distance, the extended trail of cometary debris was a significant source of cometary ions in the case of comet 73P.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Deep Precursor-Dip-Main Superoutburst Sequence in VW Hydri Observed with TESS: High-Cadence Constraints on the Thermal-Tidal Instability Model</a><span class="id">[2602.09680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present 120s cadence TESS observations of three superoutbursts of the SU UMa-type dwarf nova VW Hydri. Two events (SO2 in Sectors 87+88 and SO3 in Sector 93) exhibit a pronounced, temporally pronounced precursor-dip followed by a rapid rise into the main superoutburst plateau. This morphology, previously seen in Kepler light curves of V1504 Cyg and V344 Lyr, is a key prediction of the thermal-tidal instability (TTI) model when a normal (precursor) outburst expands the disk only marginally beyond the 3:1 resonance radius, allowing the tidal instability to grow slowly and produce a deep dip approaching quiescence before rapid amplification drives the main superoutburst. A sliding-window time-frequency analysis reveals superhump power already during the decline and near minimum light, with a smooth period evolution across the dip and stabilization after the system returns to the hot state, consistent with the growth and saturation of disk eccentricity at the 3:1 resonance. From the stabilized Stage A superhump periods, we infer a representative mass ratio $q = 0.131 \pm 0.002$. Combined with either a typical SU UMa white-dwarf mass prior or the semi-empirical donor sequence at an orbital period of 107 min, the implied component masses are $M_1 \simeq 0.6$–$1.0\,M_\odot$ and $M_2 \simeq 0.08$–$0.14\,M_\odot$, ruling out a brown-dwarf donor and establishing VW Hyi as a benchmark system for testing tidal-instability models in low-$q$ dwarf novae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2602.09705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterisation of an EXor outburst SPICY 97589</a><span class="id">[2602.09777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar outbursts from variable or periodic accretion are thought to be ubiquitous across young stellar populations. However, relatively few outbursting objects have been discovered to date. Here, we present the characterisation of a new EXor-type episodic accretor. We aim to characterise the nature of the 2023 outburst of SPICY 97589/Gaia23bab and characterise the stellar source for the first time, while exploring how an accretion outburst contributes to disk evolution. We employ multi-waveband medium-resolution spectroscopy with UVB-VIS-NIR coverage during the peak of the 2023 outburst and the post-outburst quiescent object. The broad wavelength coverage of the dataset allows for robust measurements of the accretion rate using known line tracers. The addition of quiescent spectra provides a good estimation of stellar parameters of the central star while also informing us on the evolution of the disk during outburst phases. We find the stellar source to be a 3410 K, M3.0 type star with a luminosity of 0.41 $L_\odot$ and an estimated stellar mass of 0.29 $M_\odot$. We measure the accretion rate of SPICY 97589 to be $\dot M = 2.38\pm0.58\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. This value is at two orders of magnitude greater than the quiescent accretion rate. Thus, we confirm that the 2023 outburst was driven by an influx of material from the surrounding environment to the central star, an accretion outburst. The spectral fingerprint of emission lines is also characteristic of an outbursting EXor-type source, including variable disk winds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimating Electron Densities in the Middle Solar Corona using White-light and Radio Observations</a><span class="id">[2602.09819]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The electron density of the solar corona is a fundamental parameter in many areas of solar physics. Traditionally, routine estimates of coronal density have relied exclusively on white-light observations. However, these density estimates, obtained by inverting the white-light data, require simplifying assumptions, which may affect the robustness of the measurements. Hence, to improve the reliability of coronal density measurements, it is highly desirable to explore other complementary methods. In this study, we estimate the coronal electron densities in the middle corona, between approximately $1.7-3.5R_\odot$, using low-frequency radio observations from the recently commissioned Long Wavelength Array at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO-LWA). The results demonstrate consistency with those derived from white-light coronagraph data and predictions from theoretical models. We also derive a density model valid between 1.7–3.5 $r_\odot$ and is given by $\rho (r')=1.27r'^{-2}+29.02r'^{-4}+71.18r'^{-6}$, where $r'=r/R_\odot$, and $r$ is the heliocentric distance. OVRO-LWA is a solar-dedicated radio interferometer that provides science-ready images with low latency, making it well-suited for generating regular and independent estimates of coronal densities to complement existing white-light techniques.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09835" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for rotational X-ray modulation on TIC 277539431</a><span class="id">[2602.09835]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TIC 277539431, a fast rotating M7 dwarf, was detected to host the highest latitude flare to date at $81^\circ$. Magnetic activity like stellar flares occurring at high latitude indicate occurrence of coronal loops at these latitudes on fully-convective M dwarfs. In contrast, sunspots usually occur below $30^\circ$. In our study we look for modulation on the X-ray signal occurring due to occultation of coronal loops by the star due to stellar rotation. We report an updated rotation period for this star as $P_{\text{rot}}=273.593$ min based on TESS sectors 12, 37, 39, 64 and 65. We conducted $\chi^2_{\textrm{red}}$ fits by varying the amplitude and the phase of a sinusoidally modulated signal derived from the new rotation period. We find no evidence of rotational modulation in the X-ray signal. This could be due to multiple scenarios, such as lack of a stable coronal loop during observation or the modulated signal being too weak, however given the dataset, individual scenarios cannot be distinguished.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-flight calibration of the INTEGRAL/IBIS Compton mode: Application to the Crab Nebula polarization</a><span class="id">[2602.09886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The INTEGRAL satellite explored the gamma-ray sky since its launch on October 17, 2002, and until the end of its scientific operation on February 28, 2025.

We describe the latest in-flight calibration of the Compton mode of the INTEGRAL/IBIS telescope, taking into account more than twenty years of data. The spectroscopy and polarization of the standard candle that is the Crab Nebula is analyzed in detail. We operate the IBIS telescope as a Coded mask Compton telescope, using the Crab Nebula to refine the calibration, as is usually done for high-energy instruments. We have determined the spectroscopic and polarimetric properties of the IBIS Compton mode and their evolution along the entire duration of the mission. In addition, the long-term evolution of the Crab Nebula's polarization has been successfully measured and compared with other high-energy experiments. We could estimate the energy dependence of the Crab Nebula polarization in four bands between 200 keV and 1 MeV. In particular, the detection of polarized emissions strictly above 400 keV makes it the highest energy measurement ever performed for the Crab Nebula.

The Romer delay between primary and secondary minima yields a mass ratio of $q = 0.299 \pm 0.009$, enabling robust simultaneous modeling of the light and radial velocity curves with {\sc phoebe} 2.17. By fixing the albedo of the secondary to its maximum physically plausible value (A$_2 = 1.0$), despite the degeneracy between albedo, surface temperature, and radius, we obtained a satisfactory fit, resulting in a significantly lower temperature ($T_2 \sim 2360$ K) and a radius ($R_2 \sim 0.16$ R$_\odot$) in agreement with literature values. Using the total mass of the components and the orbital size derived from this modeling, we interpret the ETVs and find them best explained by a Jupiter-mass tertiary companion on a $\sim13$-year orbit in all competing models, while the eccentric (e $\sim0.46$) models perform better in terms of fit statistics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromospheric Flashes in a Solar Pore: Insights from Multi-line Spectropolarimetric Diagnostics</a><span class="id">[2602.09943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar pores are strongly magnetized regions lacking a photospheric penumbra and characterized by predominantly vertical magnetic fields.

Bisector analysis and spectral inversions with \textsc{SIR} and \textsc{NICOLE} were used to infer stratifications of temperature, line-of-sight velocity, and magnetic field. Flashes, confined to one half of the pore, exhibit cooler photospheric temperatures ($\Delta T \approx 400$ K), stronger magnetic fields ($\Delta B \approx 250$ G), larger inclinations ($\sim25^{\circ}$ versus $\sim18^{\circ}$), and persistent upflows ($\sim0.5$ km s$^{-1}$) compared to the quiescent pore. They are co-spatial with enhanced 3- and 5-minute power in the photosphere, while only 3-minute power persists in the chromosphere. Flashes are detected down to $\sim50\%$ line depth in Ca \textsc{ii} 8542 Å intensity and show central chromospheric upflows ($\sim1$ km s$^{-1}$) flanked by strong downflows ($\sim8$ km s$^{-1}$).

Two pairs of ears, a pair of blowouts in the north and south along the long axis of this SNR, and a pair of dents compose the point symmetric morphology. The fact that the symmetry axes of two pairs include pairs of opposite structural features in the inner ejecta implies that the shaping is by jets and not due to an interaction with an ambient material.

From these data, we study  140 million galaxies (8.29 galaxies/arcmin$^2$) that are 50% complete at i=24.0 and extend beyond z=1.2. We divide the galaxies into four redshift bins, and obtain cosmic shear measurement with a signal-to-noise of 83, a factor of 2 higher than the Year 3 analysis. We model the uncertainties due to shear and redshift calibrations, and discard measurements on small angular scales to mitigate baryon feedback and other small-scale uncertainties. We consider two fiducial models to account for the intrinsic alignment (IA) of the galaxies. We conduct a blind analysis in the context of the $\Lambda$CDM model and find $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}=0.798^{+0.014}_{-0.015}$ (marginalized mean with 68% CL) when using the non-linear alignment model (NLA) and $S_{8} = 0.783^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ with the tidal alignment and tidal torque model (TATT), providing 1.8% and 2.5% uncertainty on $S_8$. Compared to constraints from the cosmic microwave background from Planck 2018, ACT DR6 and SPT-3G DR1, we find consistency in the full parameter space at 1.1$\sigma$ (1.7$\sigma$) and in $S_8$ at 2.0$\sigma$ (2.3$\sigma$) for NLA (TATT). The result using the NLA model is preferred according to the Bayesian evidence. We find that the model choice for IA and baryon feedback can impact the value of our $S_8$ constraint up to $1\sigma$. For our fiducial model choices, the resultant uncertainties in $S_8$ are primarily degraded by the removal of scales, as well as the marginalization over the IA parameters. We demonstrate that our result is internally consistent and robust to different choices in calibrating the data, owing to methodological improvements in shear and redshift measurement, laying the foundation for next-generation cosmic shear programs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia white dwarfs with infrared excess I.

These systems provide important clues in the study of extrasolar planetary material and binary evolution. However, fully characterising their properties requires a statistically significant, complete sample. This work aims to identify a complete sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc of the Sun. We built the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the WDs using synthetic photometry in 56 optical filters of the J-PAS system, generated from Gaia Data Release 3 low-resolution spectra and complemented with the latest infrared photometry available at the Virtual Observatory (VO). VOSA was used to fit the SEDs with different atmospheric WD models depending on the source spectral type. We visually checked optical and infrared images to identify contaminated photometry. We built a catalogue of 456 infrared excess WDs, of which 292 are robust identifications, and 164 are candidates. 351 ($\sim$75%) are new identifications. This implies a fraction of infrared excess WDs between 5.9$\pm$0.3% and 9.2$\pm$0.4%, higher than previous works, but in agreement with some more recent estimates. Furthermore, for the sample of infrared excess WDs, the fraction of sources with non-hydrogen atmosphere increases with the Gaia GBP-GRP colour, contrary to the general WD population. However, this result should be interpreted with caution. Additionally, a thorough comparison of our catalogue with those of previous studies was performed. The sample of WDs with infrared excess emission within 100 pc presented in this work is the largest, most complete and reliable to date. Due to their proximity, they are ideal targets for follow-up studies aimed at characterising circumstellar disks, substellar companions, and the composition of accreted planetary material.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining long-lived dark sector particles with CMB and Lyman-$α$</a><span class="id">[2602.10078]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use measurements of the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature from the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest to place new limits on models in which long-lived dark sector (DS) particles, with lifetimes longer than $10^{16}$ s, deposit energy into the IGM through their decays.

Our analysis demonstrates that constraints from late-time IGM heating offer a complementary window to those from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), in constraining dark sector parameter space.

The analysis incorporates data from the 2019/20 seasons of the SPT-3G survey in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz; from the full SPTpol dataset at 150 GHz; and from {\it Herschel}-SPIRE survey in bands centered at 600 and 857 GHz. We combine data from all the above bands using linear combination (LC) techniques to produce a tSZ or Compton-$y$ map. We modify the LC weights to produce multiple versions of the Compton-$y$ map, including minimum-variance (MV) and foreground-minimized (-min) maps. We measure the auto- and cross-spectra of a subset of these maps in the range $\ell \in [500, 5000]$. While this power spectrum includes contributions from signals other than tSZ, we present numerous checks to show that the most challenging foreground signal, the cosmic infrared background (CIB) is much lower than the desired tSZ signal in the scales of interest in this work. The final tSZ power spectrum is measured at $9.3\sigma$ with both the MV and CIB-min maps. Our results are consistent with those reported in other CMB surveys across the literature. Using the difference in the tSZ power spectrum from MV and CIB-min maps, we reconstruct the scale-dependent tSZ-CIB cross-correlation $\rho_{\ell}^{\rm tSZ \times CIB}$, finding $3.1\sigma$ evidence for a nonzero correlation coefficient that is positive on large scales and approaches zero for $\ell &gt; 2500$.

[ arXiv:2502.12237 ] to examine errors due to neglected higher-order modes for MBHBs with nonzero (aligned) progenitor spins and total mass up to $10^8\,M_\odot$. For these very massive systems, there can be regions of parameter space in which the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,\,2)$ modes are no longer dominant with respect to higher-order ones. We find that the extent of systematic bias can change significantly when varying the progenitor spins of the binary. We also find that for the heaviest, and therefore shortest, MBHB signals, slight systematic errors can cause severe mis-inference of the sky localization parameters.

We discuss the tuning that is required to successfully explain the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) signal in each of these cases, and highlight the underlying physical mechanisms.

A sufficiently large positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, sets the future asymptotic horizon scale of the observable Universe, $\sim$$\Lambda^{-1/2}$, thereby implying that the observable Universe may simply be a minute patch of a far larger pre-existing one, hereafter a Small Patch Hypothesis. Importantly, this observational bound is purely geometric; regardless of when the Universe is observed, the maximum accessible scale is finite and fixed by $\Lambda$, independent of inflationary dynamics, anthropic arguments, or assumptions about the global hosting spacetime. In this sense, inflation becomes one viable realization of the proposed Small Patch Hypothesis. Here, one particular non-inflationary alternative is considered for illustrative purposes in which a primordial spectrum grows logarithmically toward large scales, and in fact diverges at some finite $k_{c}$. If $k_{c}\ll \Lambda^{-1/2}$, then our local cosmic patch probes only the linear regime and appears exceptionally smooth. Over the comparatively narrow observable window, this power spectrum mimics a slightly red-tilted, inflation-like spectrum. Rather than introducing high-energy new fields, this perspective frames large-scale homogeneity, isotropy, Gaussianity, adiabaticity, and the observed thermodynamic Arrow of Time as possible consequences of restricted observational access to a much larger Universe in equilibrium, rather than signatures of a unique early-Universe mechanism.

Here we formulate this process as a genuine three-body problem within the hyperspherical coordinate framework and evaluate decay probabilities by numerically solving the corresponding hyperradial Schrödinger equation, combined with large-scale random sampling of the potential parameters; the latter treatment ensures that the present results are more convincing. Inspired by this, we demonstrate that the penetrability ratio between simultaneous and sequential $\alpha$ emission exhibits a strikingly linear dependence on $ZQ_{\alpha\alpha}^{-1/2}$, extending the barrier penetration dynamics into the correlated few-body regime. The nuclei $^{108}$Xe, $^{218}$Ra, $^{224}$Pu, $^{222}$U, $^{216}$Rn, and $^{220}$Th are suggested as the most promising candidates for the observation of double-$\alpha$ decay, with predicted half-lives potentially accessible within present detection limits. Our results provide a unified framework for multi-$\alpha$ decay and open a pathway to probing nuclear clustering and few-body correlations in heavy nuclei.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minimal Freeze-in Dark Matter: Reviving electroweak doublet dark matter with Boltzmann suppressed freeze-in</a><span class="id">[2602.10112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter communicating with the Standard Model solely via electroweak interactions provides a compelling picture. However, thermal freeze-out of electroweak doublet dark matter is generically strongly excluded by direct detection. We show that SU(2)${}_L$ doublet fermion dark matter evades direct detection if its mass exceeds $10^{10}$ GeV. If the neutral Dirac fermion is split into a pseudo-Dirac pair (via high dimension operator) this limit can be relaxed to 300 GeV. Provided the dark matter mass is above the reheat temperature of the Universe, the production rate never exceeds the Hubble rate in cases of interest, thus the dark matter never thermalizes. We apply constraints from direct detection (e.g. LZ) and consider the discovery potential of Darwin. This scenario presents the most minimal model of freeze-in dark matter, and is both elegant and highly predictive.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflation with the Chern-Simons term in the Palatini formulation</a><span class="id">[2408.14983]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider the Chern–Simons term coupled to the inflaton in the Palatini formulation of general relativity. In contrast to the metric formulation, here the Chern–Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately solve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order of the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation. We consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when non-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton kinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the potential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the field, the Chern–Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections spoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The Palatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due to the Chern–Simons term in the metric formulation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GEMS JWST: Transmission spectroscopy of TOI-5205b reveals significant stellar contamination and a metal-poor atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2502.06966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M dwarfs (GEMS) present an opportunity to investigate their atmospheric compositions and explore how such massive planets can form around low-mass stars contrary to canonical formation models. Here, we present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet ($M_p=1.08~\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf. We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. Our data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted star spots is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths $\lambda\lesssim3.0$ um, which reduced the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models. The degree of stellar contamination also prevented the definitive detection of any $\mathrm{H_2O}$, which has primary absorption features at these shorter wavelengths. The broad wavelength coverage of NIRSpec PRISM enabled a robust detection of $\mathrm{CH_4}$ and $\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um. Our gridded and Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with both sub-solar metallicity ($\log\mathrm{[M/H]}\sim-2$ for a clear atmosphere) and super-solar C/O ratio ($\log\mathrm{[C/O]}\sim3$ for a clear or cloudy atmosphere). This contrasts with estimates from planetary interior models that predict a bulk metallicity of 10–20%, which is $\sim100\times$ the atmospheric metallicity, and suggests that the planetary interior for TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere and not well mixed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retrieving the hot circumgalactic medium physics from the X-ray radial profile from eROSITA with an IlustrisTNG-based forward model</a><span class="id">[2504.03840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent eROSITA measurements of the radial profiles of the hot CGM in the Milky-Way stellar mass (MW-mass) regime provide us with a new benchmark to constrain the hot gas around MW-mass central and satellite galaxies and their halo mass distributions. Modelling this rich data set with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations is required to further our understanding of the shortcomings in the current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution models. We develop forward models for the stacked X-ray radial surface brightness profile measured by eROSITA around MW-mass galaxies. Our model contains two emitting components: hot gas (around central galaxies and satellite galaxies hosted by more massive halos) and X-ray point sources (X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei). We model the hot gas profile using the TNG300-based products. We generate mock observations with our TNG300-based model (matching stellar mass and redshift with observations) with different underlying halo mass distributions. We show that for the same mean stellar mass, a factor 2x increase in the mean value of the underlying halo mass distribution results in a  4x increase in the stacked X-ray luminosity from the hot CGM. The point sources are described by a simple point-spread-function (PSF) of eROSITA, and we fit their normalization in this work. Using empirical models to derive a permissible range of AGN and XRB luminosities in the MW-mass X-ray galaxy stack, we choose our forward model best describing the hot CGM for the eROSITA observations. We find that at &lt; 40 kpc from the galaxy centre, the hot CGM from central galaxies and the X-ray point sources emission each account for 40-50% of the total X-ray emission budget. In summary, we show that the gas physics driving the shape of the observed hot CGM (in stellar-mass-selected samples) is tightly correlated by the underlying halo-mass distribution (abridged).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-Dependence of Subsurface Solar Convection Using the Time-Distance Deep-Focus Method</a><span class="id">[2505.05454]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We re-examine the deep-focus methodology of time-distance helioseismology previously used to estimate the power spectrum of the solar convection at a depth of about 30 Mm, which was found to be significantly weaker than predicted by theory and simulations. The Global Acoustic, Linearized Euler (GALE) and Eulerian Lagrangian (EULAG) codes are used to generate ground-truth simulations to evaluate the accuracy of the inferred convective power spectrum. This validation process shows that the power spectrum derived using the time-distance methodology diverges significantly from ground truth beyond spatial scales corresponding to the spherical harmonic degree $\ell=15$–$30$ because of the limited resolution of helioseismic measurements at that depth. However, the power estimated at larger spatial scales ($\ell&lt;15$) is sufficiently accurate. We then apply the methodology to solar data selected from throughout Solar Cycle 24 and find some evidence that the magnitude of the convective power changes throughout the Cycle. An average of the convective power across the Solar Cycle reveals a spectrum that is qualitatively similar to previous estimates, though about half an order of magnitude greater. The disagreement between observations of solar convection and the magnitudes predicted by simulations persists.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$: fast differentiable angular power spectra beyond Limber</a><span class="id">[2505.22718]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The upcoming stage IV wide-field surveys will provide high precision measurements of the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe.

For this purpose, we introduce $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$, a fast, accurate and differentiable $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline for the computation of the angular power spectrum beyond the Limber approximation. It uses a new FFTLog-based method which can reach arbitrary precision and includes interpolation along $k$, allowing for $k$-dependent growth factor and biases. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ includes a wide range of probes and effects such as galaxy clustering, including magnification bias, redshift-space distortions and primordial non-Gaussianity, weak lensing, including intrinsic alignment, cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and CMB integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We compare our pipeline to the other available beyond-Limber codes within the N5K challenge from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Dark Energy Science Collaboration. $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ computes the 120 different angular power spectra over 103 $\ell$-multipoles in 5 ms on one GPU core while the computation of the gradient is approximately 4$\times$ slower. Using a pre-calculation, $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$ is thus about 40$\times$ faster than the winner of the N5K challenge with comparable accuracy. Furthermore, all outputs are auto-differentiable, facilitating gradient-based sampling and robust and accurate Fisher forecasts. We showcase a Markov Chain Monte Carlo, a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and a Fisher forecast on an LSST-like survey, illustrating $\texttt{SwiftC}_\ell$'s differentiability, speed and reliability in measuring cosmological parameters.

(2024a) show that optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs) commonly produce delayed radio emission that can peak years post-disruption. Here, we explore the multi-wavelength properties of a sample of radio-observed optically selected TDEs to shed light on the physical process(es) responsible for the late-rising radio emission. We combine new late-time X-ray observations with archival optical, UV, X-ray, and radio data to conclude that a diversity of accretion-driven outflows may power delayed radio emission in TDEs. Our analysis suggests that some late radio outflows may be launched by a delayed phase of super-Eddington accretion onto the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while others may result from a state transition to a “low-hard” radiatively inefficient accretion flow or the deceleration of an off-axis relativistic jet. We find that TDEs with delayed radio emission are less likely to exhibit helium emission lines at early times ($p=0.002$) and may have larger optical/UV photospheric radii ($p=0.026$) than other TDEs, possibly also indicating that the onset of SMBH accretion is delayed in these systems. Our results have implications for our understanding of state changes in SMBH accretion flows, the circularization timescale for TDE debris, and the prevalence of off-axis jets in TDEs, and motivate systematic, long-term monitoring of these unique transients. The objects in our sample with the brightest radio emission are also detected in the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS), demonstrating that all-sky radio surveys can play an important role in discovering unexpected properties of the TDE population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02692" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic structure from the path integral of classical mechanics and its comparison to standard perturbation theory</a><span class="id">[2507.02692]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate cosmic structure formation in the framework of a path-integral formulation of an $N$-particle ensemble in phase space, dubbed Resummed Kinetic Field Theory (RKFT), up to one-loop perturbative order.

In contrast to earlier works, we propose a different method of sampling initial conditions, with a Gaussian initial phase-space density. Doing so, we exactly reproduce the corresponding results from Eulerian standard perturbation theory (SPT) at one-loop order, showing that formerly found deviations can be fully attributed to inconsistencies in the previous sampling method.

In this case, the induced gravitational waves include contributions from three types of source terms: scalar-scalar, tensor-scalar, and tensor-tensor. To distinguish them from second-order scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we refer to those generated by these three source terms as tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs). We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current pulsar timing array (PTA) observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of a Long-Lived Deep-Seated Main-Sequence Magnetic Field During White Dwarf Cooling</a><span class="id">[2508.09268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the evolution of white dwarf (WD) magnetic fields that originate from core-convective dynamos during the main-sequence. Using stellar evolution and WD cooling models combined with magnetic field diffusion calculations, we demonstrate that a surviving field from the main-sequence can account for various features observed in magnetic WDs. In particular, the earlier emergence of stronger magnetic fields in more massive WDs, compared to older, less massive, and less magnetic ones, can be explained by this framework. This is because the magnetic boundary at the onset of WD cooling lies deeper in less massive WDs, resulting in a slower and weaker evolution of the surface magnetic field due to increasing electrical conductivity over time. We further show that many of the magnetic field strengths observed across different WD samples can be reproduced if the deep-seated field generated during the main sequence is comparable to predictions from magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-convective dynamos, or if equipartition provides a valid scaling for the main-sequence dynamo. Additionally, our predictions for surface magnetic fields vary by a factor of 2 to 4 when higher-order modes of poloidal magnetic field expansion and turbulent diffusion driven by crystallization-induced convection are included. These effects should therefore be considered when investigating the origin of magnetic fields in individual WDs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00753" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of projection-induced optical selection bias on the weak lensing mass calibration of galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2510.00753]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak gravitational lensing signals of optically identified clusters are impacted by a selection bias – halo triaxiality and large-scale structure along the line of sight simultaneously boost the lensing signal and richness (the inferred number of galaxies associated with a cluster). As a result, a cluster sample selected by richness has a mean lensing signal higher than expected from its mean mass, and the inferred mass will be biased high. This selection bias is currently limiting the accuracy of cosmological parameters derived from optical clusters. In this paper, we quantify the bias in mass calibration due to this selection bias. Using two simulations, MiniUchuu and Cardinal, with different galaxy models and cluster finders, we find that the selection bias leads to an overestimation of lensing mass at the 20-50% level, with a larger bias (20-80%) for large-scale lensing (&gt;3 Mpc). Even with a moderate projection model, this selection bias significantly outweighs other currently known cluster lensing systematics. This work confirms the need to account for this bias in future optical cluster cosmology analyses, and we discuss strategies for mitigating this bias.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting gravitational lensing by matter currents</a><span class="id">[2510.19798]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the observational prospects for detecting gravitational lensing induced by cosmological matter currents, a relativistic correction to the standard density lensing effect arising from the motion of matter.

The pre-eruption and post-eruption counterpart was at $V$=14.0, making the smallest known classical nova amplitude of 3.1 mag. The nova light and the counterpart coincide to 0.034 arc-seconds, and the counterpart is a rare hot/blue emission-line star with flickering, so the identification of the quiescent nova is certain. The counterpart is a weak Be main sequence star, B1 V(n)(e). A coherent photometric period appears in all four {\it TESS} Sectors and in the AAVSO post-eruption light curve, as ellipsoidal modulation with orbital period 2.041738 days. The companion must have been spun-up to a fast rotation, and like all Be stars, a decretion disk is exuded. With the constraints of the blackbody radius and the main sequence, the companion mass is 13.0$^{+0.2}_{-0.5}$ $M_{\odot}$, with radius 6.2$\pm$0.2 $R_{\odot}$. This is the discovery of a cataclysmic variable with a high-mass companion, a new class that we call `High Mass Cataclysmic Variables'. The white dwarf mass is 1.25$\pm$0.10 $M_{\odot}$ and must have an accretion disk that supplies fuel for the nova eruption. FQ Cir represents a new mode of accretion in interacting binaries, with Roche lobe overflow from the decretion disk feeding mass into the usual accretion disk around the white dwarf, for disk-to-disk accretion. From the mass budget of the binary, the primary star must have its initial mass $&gt;$7.6 $M_{\odot}$, forming an ONe white dwarf, so FQ Cir can never become a Type Ia supernova.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</a><span class="id">[2511.23219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2D or not 2D?

When current sheets evolve reaching a critical inverse aspect ratio, scaling as $S^{-1/3}$ with the plasma Lundquist number, the so-called \textit{ideal} tearing instability sets in, with modes growing, independently of $S$, extremely rapidly on timescales of only a few light-crossing times of the sheet length. We present the first set of fully 3D simulations of current-sheet disruption triggered by the ideal tearing instability within the resistive relativistic MHD approximation, as appropriate in situations where the Alfvén velocity approaches the speed of light. We compare 3D setups with different initial conditions with their 2D counterparts, and we assess the impact of dimensionality and of the magnetic field topology on the onset, evolution, and efficiency of reconnection. In force-free configurations, 3D runs develop ideal tearing, secondary instabilities, and a thick, turbulent current layer, sustaining dissipation of magnetic energy longer than in 2D. In pressure-balanced current sheets with a null guide field, 2D reference runs show the familiar reconnection dynamics, whereas in 3D tearing dynamics is quenched after the linear phase, as pressure-driven modes growing on forming plasmoids outcompete plasmoid coalescence and suppress fast dissipation of magnetic energy. Taken together, these results suggest that the evolution and efficiency of reconnection depend sensitively on the local plasma conditions and current-sheet configuration, and can be properly captured only in fully 3D simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards an optimal extraction of cosmological parameters from galaxy cluster surveys using convolutional neural networks</a><span class="id">[2601.03894]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The possibility to constrain cosmological parameters from galaxy surveys using field-level machine learning methods that bypass traditional summary statistics analyses, depends crucially on our ability to generate simulated training sets. The latter need to be both realistic, as to reproduce the key features of the real data, and produced in large numbers, as to allow us to refine the precision of the training process. The analysis presented in this paper is an attempt to respond to these needs by (a) using clusters of galaxies as tracers of large-scale structure, together with (b) adopting a 3LPT code (Pinocchio) to generate a large training set of $32\,768$ mock X-ray cluster catalogues. X-ray luminosities are stochastically assigned to dark matter haloes using an empirical $M-L_X$ scaling relation. Using this training set, we test the ability and performances of a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the cosmological parameters, based on an input overdensity field derived from the cluster distribution. We perform a comparison with a neural network trained on traditional summary statistics, that is, the abundance of clusters and their power spectrum. Our results show that the field-level analysis combined with the cluster abundance yields a mean absolute relative error on the predicted values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ that is a factor of $\sim 10 \%$ and $\sim 20\%$ better than that obtained from the summary statistics.

The nature of the eccentric O+BH binary candidate VFTS 812</a><span class="id">[2602.03650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive O-type stars ($M\gtrsim15\,M_\odot$) with an X-ray quiet black hole (BH) companion represent a crucial stage in massive binary evolution leading to binary BH mergers. The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$\delta$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\,M_\odot$. Following careful removal of the nebular contamination, spectral disentangling on the new data did not reveal any signature of the hidden companion. We derive $T_\mathrm{eff}=49^{+3}_{-4}$ kK, $\log L/L_\odot=5.7\pm0.1$ and $v_\mathrm{rot,max}{\rm \,sin\,}i=110^{+25}_{-35}$ km/s for the O4V component, yielding a (single star) evolutionary mass of $53^{+6}_{-5}$ $M_\odot$ and an age in the range of 0-1.6 Myr. Using injection tests of various luminous artificial companions in our data, we exhaustively rule out the presence of any luminous signature from a main sequence star more massive than $6\,M_\odot$. We discuss the possible nature of the companion, suggesting that the rejuvenated O star + BH companion is the most suitable scenario to consistently explain the location, (rejuvenated) young age, eccentricity and lack of companion signature. While this establishes VFTS 812 as a strong candidate O+BH system, follow-up observations are deemed necessary for robust confirmation and to search for accretion signatures on the O4V star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak Lensing Low Multipoles</a><span class="id">[2602.04504]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse the low–multipole components of the weak-lensing convergence field in a FLRW universe. The low–multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $\Lambda$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to “Milky Way–like” observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $\Lambda$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way–like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmographic parameters from current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors</a><span class="id">[2602.05969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We evaluate the capability of current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope and DECIGO, to constrain cosmographic parameters using electromagnetically bright standard sirens. By adopting a third-order Taylor expansion, we analyze how signal-to-noise ratios and the number of events impact the estimates of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. Our results show that while Advanced LIGO provides a calibration-free measurement of $H_0$ at the few-percent level, it remains insensitive to higher-order parameters. In contrast, the Einstein Telescope and DECIGO reach sub-percent accuracy for $H_0$. Notably, DECIGO achieves a precision better than 10\% for the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and a few tens of percent for the jerk parameter $j_0$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RedDots: Multiplanet system around M dwarf GJ 887 in the solar neighborhood</a><span class="id">[2602.08929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GJ 887 is a bright M dwarf in the solar neighborhood with two currently reported nontransiting exoplanets with periods of $9~\mathrm{d}$ and $21~\mathrm{d,}$ along with an additional unconfirmed signal at $50~\mathrm{d}$. We reanalyzed the system with 101 new HARPS and 12 new ESPRESSO radial velocities (RVs) secured with a cadence to confirm or refute the origin of the $50~\mathrm{d}$ signal. To do so, we searched for signals related to stellar activity in photometric data and spectroscopic indicators. We modeled the stellar activity in the RVs with Gaussian processes (GPs). With the Bayesian analysis, we confirmed a four-planet model, including the two previously known planets at periods of $9.2619\pm0.0005~\mathrm{d}$ and $21.784\pm0.004~\mathrm{d,}$ as well as two newly confirmed exoplanets: an Earth-mass planet, with a $4.42490\pm0.00014~\mathrm{d}$ period and a sub-meter-per-second amplitude, and a super-Earth with a $50.77\pm0.05~\mathrm{d}$ period located in the habitable zone (HZ). This super-Earth is the second closest planet in the HZ, after Proxima Cen b. We found an additional signal in a 2:1 resonance with the $4.4~\mathrm{d}$ planet at $2.21661\pm0.00010~\mathrm{d}$ with an amplitude of $0.37\pm0.09~\mathrm{m/s}$, which could be related to an additional planet. However, other explanations of its origin are also plausible. This signal remains a candidate, as further investigation is required to confirm its true nature. If the signal is caused by a planet, its minimum mass would be half that of Earth. We measured the stellar rotation period with the characteristic periodic timescale of the GP. We found a period of $38.7\pm0.5~\mathrm{d}$, which is consistent with the rotation period determined from photometry and other activity indices.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope</a><span class="id">[2402.17140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. Through a careful analysis of photon generation induced by DPDM on the various optical elements of JWST, we find that the contribution of these photons to the detected signal is negligible. Nevertheless, we propose a modified configuration of the JWST mirrors that would enable the DPDM-induced photons to be focused onto the detector. This approach can be applied to future space telescopes during their ground-testing phases. Using the JWST parameters as a representative example, the achievable upper limits on the DPDM-photon mixing constant are $\epsilon\sim 10^{-12}-10^{-14}$ in the frequency range $10-500$ THz at the 95\% confidence level. This reveals the strong potential of future space telescopes for DPDM detection during ground testing, with sensitivities exceeding current limits by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude compared with the XENON1T result and the solar cooling bound.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multi-parameter expansion for the evolution of asymmetric binaries in astrophysical environments</a><span class="id">[2507.04471]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Hole Ringdown Amplitudescopy</a><span class="id">[2510.11782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields – such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom – that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phantom cosmology with arbitrary potential: New accelerating scaling attractors</a><span class="id">[2510.17765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this article, we investigate the existence of accelerating scaling solutions in coupled phantom cosmology without assuming any specific potential for the phantom scalar field. The coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the dissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The evolution equations are written in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the only requirement imposed on the otherwise arbitrary phantom potential is that a particular dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its derivative, must be invertible. For such a generic potential, we show that accelerated scaling solutions do exist, for both constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions – specifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a long enough matter-dominated era – our results show that the existence of a direct coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great potential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.</p></div></details></article></body>
