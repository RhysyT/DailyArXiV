However, AAs can also arise from abiotic processes on planets and in space. For example, material from asteroid Bennu contained 33 AAs, including 15 of the 20 proteinogenic AAs that are fundamental to life's functions. Distinguishing life from non-life based on AAs in a sample remains an unsolved problem, particularly when their isotopic and structural signatures (e.g., chirality) could be altered via physicochemical processes. Here we introduce LUMOS (Life Unveiled via Molecular Orbital Signatures), a statistical framework that distinguishes life from non-life by analyzing the distribution of abundance-weighted HOMO-LUMO gap (HLG) values of AAs within a sample. Compilation of AAs datasets from diverse environments and provenances revealed that abiotic samples display highly uniform distributions of AAs HLGs. In contrast, biotic samples show greater variance and preference towards AAs with lower HLG, likely reflecting the need for life to control when, where, and how chemical reactions occur. LUMOS achieves &gt;95% accuracy in distinguishing biotic versus abiotic provenance across diverse environmental and extraterrestrial conditions. These results suggest that varied molecular reactivity within biochemical systems may be a universal feature of life, representing an agnostic biosignature unlinked to the specific set of AAs used by life as we know it. LUMOS is compatible with existing analytical instrumentation, applicable to returned samples or in situ analyses. Broader characterization of abiotic and biotic environments will further refine the chemical boundaries separating biotic from abiotic chemical systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simultaneous Double Transits of Phobos and Deimos as Seen from the Martian Surface: A Millennium Catalogue</a><span class="id">[2602.18513]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I present the first systematic catalogue of simultaneous solar transits of both Phobos and Deimos as observed from the surface of Mars. Using the JPL mar099 ephemeris (Brozovic et al. 2025) and SPICE toolkit, I searched the millennium 1600-2600 CE for epochs at which both Martian moons project onto the solar disc at the same instant for at least one surface location. I identify 8565 grazing double transits, 49 partial-overlap double transits (both moons simultaneously on the solar disc, with at least one partially cut off by the limb), and 17 full double transits in which both moons lie wholly within the solar disc at the same moment. All events cluster tightly around the Martian equinoxes (Ls   0 deg or 180 deg) and within +/- 9 deg of the equator, reflecting the near-equatorial orbital inclinations of both moons. I derive a hard theoretical latitude limit of +/- 13.1 deg beyond which simultaneous double transits are geometrically impossible. The next observable partial double transit, excluding less prominent grazing events, is predicted for 2034 April 17. The next full double transit, with both moons wholly inside the solar disc, with a gap between each silhouette and the solar limb, occurs on 2118 November 20. The geometries for both these events were confirmed with JPL Horizons. I provide uncertainty estimates based on the Brozovic et al. covariance model, with predicted position errors growing from  1 km for near-term events to  600 km at the catalogue boundaries, and note that the JAXA MMX mission ( 2031) will dramatically reduce uncertainties for all post-2030 predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POSEIDON I: The Dynamical Origins of Transiting Neptunes</a><span class="id">[2602.18553]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first results from the POSEIDON survey, aimed at constraining the dynamical origins of transiting Neptunes through stellar obliquity measurements. We report Rossiter-McLaughlin observations of two Neptunes, TOI-181 b and TOI-883 b, obtained with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/PFS and WIYN/NEID. TOI-181 b is on a 4.5-day orbit with a sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment $\lambda = 32.0_{-6.5}^{+6.3}\,^{\circ}$ and a low eccentricity ($e&lt;0.12$ with $2\sigma$ confidence). TOI-883 b has a longer orbital period of 10 days with $\lambda = 22_{-14}^{+15}\,^{\circ}$ and eccentricity $e = 0.16 \pm 0.03$. The significant misalignment of TOI-181 b and the significant eccentricity of TOI-883 b are suggestive of high-eccentricity migration for both systems. After adding these and other new measurements to the sample, we analyze the obliquity distribution of the host stars of transiting Neptunes. Earlier studies had suggested that the obliquity distribution is bimodal, with peaks corresponding to aligned orbits and polar orbits; the addition of more measurements has weakened the evidence for bimodality. The current sample appears to be consistent with a population of well-aligned systems and a smaller population with nearly random obliquities. This distribution resembles that observed for more massive planets, suggesting that transiting Jupiters and Neptunes originate from similar dynamical processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A dedicated survey of fast-rotating near-Earth asteroids with the Two-meter Twin Telescope. I. Observational strategy and first results</a><span class="id">[2602.18562]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rotational properties of small near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) provide crucial insights into their internal structure and collisional history. However, systematic surveys targeting metre- to decametre-sized bodies are rare, thus leaving their spin distribution poorly constrained. Our aim was to quantify the prevalence of fast rotation and characterise the spin-rate distribution of small NEAs to constrain their internal strength and evolution. We conducted a dedicated high-cadence photometric survey of 249 NEAs using the Two-meter Twin Telescope (TTT). Rotation periods and amplitudes were derived from dense time series to classify objects as fast or non-fast rotators. We determined the rotation period of 156 new fast rotators (P &lt; 2.2 h), including 87 that rotate faster than 10 min. The prevalence of fast rotators increases with absolute magnitude: from 60.6-80.3 % for 22 &lt; H &lt; 24 to 77.3-89.4 % for 24 &lt; H &lt; 26 and 94.1-96.1 % for H &gt; 26, indicating that fast rotation dominates in the small NEA population. Most objects spin faster than the gravity-defined limit; 98 targets require cohesive strengths exceeding that of weak rubble piles, and 22 are compatible only with compact, high-strength interiors. This is the first systematic survey targeting the rotation of such small NEAs, providing the largest homogeneous sample of fast rotators obtained by a single campaign. Our findings demonstrate that fast rotation is the norm for objects smaller than tens of metres, implying that modest cohesive strength is required to prevent their rotational disruption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abundance Calculations of Neon Isotopes in the Predicted Lifetime of the Sun</a><span class="id">[2602.18566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The elemental abundances of neon isotopes provide valuable insights into stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. In this study, we calculate the abundances of the isotopes 18Ne, 19Ne, 20Ne, 21Ne, and 22Ne across the five principal evolutionary phases of the Sun: hydrogen burning, lively old age, onset of rapid growth and red giant, helium burning and helium exhaustion. The calculations were carried out using the open-source nucnet-tools package, developed by the Webnucleo Group at Clemson University. Initial isotope abundances were adopted from standard proto-solar compositions. Their evolution was computed under static hydrostatic burning conditions, assuming constant temperature and density within each phase. The results show that the stable isotopes 20Ne and 22Ne remain dominant throughout the Sun's lifetime, whereas the short-lived isotopes 18Ne and 19Ne decay rapidly during or shortly after the hydrogen-burning phase. The predictions obtained for the helium burning and exhaustion phases provide quantitative neon-isotope abundances that are not extensively reported in the existing literature. These results offer valuable reference values for future studies of solar and stellar evolution, nucleosynthetic pathways, and isotopic modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of electron precipitation on Earth's thermospheric NO production and the drag of LEO satellites</a><span class="id">[2602.18595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the response of space weather events on Earth's upper atmosphere over the polar regions by studying their effect on the drag of the CHAMP and GRACE satellites. Increasing solar activity that results in heating and the expansion of the upper atmosphere threatens low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. Auroral events are closely related to the stellar energy deposition of solar EUV radiation and precipitating energetic electrons, which influence photochemical processes such as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in the upper atmosphere. To study the production of NO molecules and their influence on the thermospheric structure and satellite drag, we first model Earth's background thermosphere with the 1D upper atmosphere model Kompot by considering the incident X-ray, EUV, and IR radiation during selected space weather events. To investigate the effect of electron precipitation in the production of NO molecules in the polar thermosphere, we apply a Monte Carlo model accounting for the stochastic nature of collisional scattering of auroral electrons in collisions with the surrounding N$_2$-O$_2$ atmosphere, including the production of suprathermal N atoms. The observed effect of the atmospheric drag on CHAMP and GRACE during the two studied events indicates that a sporadic enhancement of NO molecule production in the polar thermosphere and its IR-cooling capability, which counteracts thermospheric expansion and can lead to an “overcooling” with decreased density after the space weather event, can have a protective effect on LEO satellites. Their production efficiency, however, is highly dependent on the energy flux of the precipitating electrons. Our results have direct implications for empirical satellite orbit prediction models, as our simulations highlight the need to consider precipitation-induced NO production to improve the predictive power of these models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 2021 Hot-type Symbiotic Outburst of YY Herculis: An Optical Follow-up Study</a><span class="id">[2602.18596]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have followed up on the hot-type classical symbiotic outburst reported in YY Her using the Himalayan Chandra telescope. The outburst coincides with the secondary minima of the system. Approximately 12 similar brightening events have been reported between 1890 and 2020, with only the 1993 outburst being studied spectroscopically. In our study, we monitored the system from 2021 to 2023, covering $\sim$1.5 orbital cycles, providing an opportunity to understand the spectral evolution of the outburst over a complete orbital period of YY Her. We found that the temperature and luminosity estimations based on emission line fluxes exhibit orbital phase dependence. The values estimated at phase 0.5, corresponding to the secondary minimum, were the most reliable. The temperature of the hot component is $\approx 1.41 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}$, and the luminosity is $\approx 1020 \, L_{\odot}$ during the outburst, reduced to $\approx 1.3 \times 10^5 \, \text{K}$ and $\approx 830 \, L_{\odot}$ after one orbital cycle at phase 0.5. Temperature estimations during the outbursts suggest that YY Her exhibits both hot-type (2021) and cool-type (1993) behavior, similar to another symbiotic star, AG Dra. Using variations of the Ca II absorption lines, we confirmed the contribution of the ellipsoidal effect in secondary minima in the YY Her light curve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic structure of coronal dark halos</a><span class="id">[2602.18604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At low coronal temperatures around or below 1 MK distinct areas in the surroundings of active regions (AR) show emission at a level significantly below the emission coming from the quiet Sun (QS). These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\leq$1 MK is $\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Physics of Solar Energetic Particles</a><span class="id">[2602.18617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are produced in two fundamental ways: at magnetic reconnection sites in solar jets and at collisionless shock waves driven by fast coronal mass ejections (CMEs). &quot;Impulsive&quot; SEP events, on open field lines from jets, have signature abundance enhancements of 3He and of increasingly heavy elements, and their outward streaming electrons drive type-III radio bursts. Similar acceleration for particles trapped on closed loops energizes solar flares. In contrast, fast, wide, CME-driven shocks accelerate seed ions from the ambient corona that grow resonant Alfven waves as they stream outward. These waves can scatter and trap lower-rigidity ions near the shock, limiting outflow, and flattening low-energy spectra upstream at the &quot;streaming limit.&quot; Downstream, a spatially-uniform &quot;reservoir&quot; of SEPs is shed by the expanding shock between it and the Sun. These trapped invariant SEP spectra decrease in intensity adiabatically as the volume of the reservoir expands. Ions from the reservoir can seed further acceleration in multi-shock event and energetic proton precipitation can prolong solar gamma-ray emission. Shocks are often additionally seeded by residual impulsive ions which dominate the SEP heavy-ion abundances with their signature enhancements. As samples of the corona, SEP abundances also probe differences with the photosphere that depend upon the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18625" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar cycle irregularity study</a><span class="id">[2602.18625]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has recently been discovered that the time phases (time-varying delays) of the irregular periodicities observed in the Sunspot series, consisting of the approximate 27-day latitude-averaged plasma rotation and approximate 11-yr magnetic pole reversal, share a common pattern or cycle of irregularity. Because the method of measurement contains an unknown constant delay of no practical significance, the average of the measured cycle of delay is subtracted out, and the resultant cycle proceeds from zero delay to maximum delay, back to zero delay, then to maximum advance, and finally back to zero advance/delay. The period of this cycle is estimated to be 164 years, which does not allow for even one full repetition of the pattern in the 205-yr data record. So, it may or may not be a segment of an ongoing (pseudo) periodicity. Nevertheless, the fact that this cycle of irregularity in period is shared by two long-recognized genuine irregular periodicities tied to specific activity from two distinct solar phenomena suggests there is a common phenomenon affecting these periodicities. The physics-based link between the rotation speed of the interior of the Sun and the average over latitude of the rotation period of the surface plasma, approximately 27 days on average, suggests the possibility that there may be a single primary phenomenon that is responsible for irregularity of both rotation of the interior of the Sun and the period, approximately 11 yrs on average, of pole-reversal. This is consistent with recently reported (November 2025) results on hypothesized planetary forcing of the Solar dynamo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion disks in (repeating) partial tidal disruption events: rapid state transitions, UV plateaus and flares from disk-remnant collisions</a><span class="id">[2602.18698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruption events which repeat on timescales of months-to-years represent an unambiguous signature of a partial disruption, with the surviving stellar remnant returning to pericentre to be repeatedly stripped by tidal forces. These systems therefore offer the best laboratories to study the differences between partial and full disruptions. One noteworthy observational difference between the two systems is that all known X-ray bright repeating TDEs show rapid transitions between thermal, non-thermal and completely dim states on timescales much shorter than full (non-repeating) TDEs. We argue this can be simply understood as being due to the reduction in fuel supply available to the disk, and that these systems provide evidence that all tidal disruption events undergo a state transition at Eddington ratios $f_{\rm edd} = L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm edd} \sim 0.01$, similar to X-ray binaries. {As part of this calculation we derive a general expression for the time taken for a TDE disk to fall to a given Eddington fraction, which will be of use to both full and partial TDE science.} Perhaps surprisingly, the late-time optical/UV plateau luminosity observed from these systems is largely unaffected by this reduction in fuel supply, provided the outer disk remains in a thermal state for long enough for this emission to be detected. We then show that collisions between the returning stellar remnant and the disk formed from the last passage will produce potentially observable X-ray flares ($L_{\rm flare} \simeq 10^{42}$ erg/s), but that they are likely to be very difficult to detect as they are generally short-lived ($t_{\rm flare} \simeq 0.1-1$ hr).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast reconnection in a coronal torn plasma sheet</a><span class="id">[2602.18706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tearing instability, also known as plasmoid instability, is an effective mechanism to speed up magnetic reconnection process, working in a wide range of magnetized plasma systems with different spatial scales, ionization degrees, and collisionality. However, due to observational limitations, observations of {plasma sheet} tearing and the resulting plasmoids are rather scarce. This scarcity significantly hinders our understanding of the role of plasmoids in the reconnection process from an observational perspective. Using high-spatiotemporal multiwavelength observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we traced the entire evolution of a coronal {plasma sheet}. Its formation was driven by the emergence of photospheric magnetic flux, followed by tearing, and eventual decay. The evolution of the {plasma sheet} exhibited two distinct stages. Initially, it rose rapidly, lengthened, and underwent tearing at a low frequency. Subsequently, its ascent slowed, it began to shorten, and the tearing occurred more frequently. Detailed analysis of the reconnecting {plasma sheet} focuses on heating, plasmoid dynamics (formation and ejection), and the resulting reconnection rate change. Two key heating processes are identified: {plasma sheet} tearing and coalescence involving plasmoids and magnetic cusps. More importantly, combining observations with analytical studies suggests that plasmoids are key carriers of magnetic flux fast transferring in the observed torn {plasma sheet}, and their formation and ejection significantly enhance the reconnection rate and facilitate the onset of fast reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diverse properties of electron Forbush decreases revealed by the Dark Matter Particle Explorer</a><span class="id">[2602.18743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Forbush decrease (FD) of cosmic rays is an important probe of the interplanetary environment disturbed by solar activities. In this work, we study the properties of 8 FDs electrons (including positrons) between 2 GeV and 20 GeV from January, 2016 to March, 2024, with the Dark Matter Particle Explorer. The maximum decrease amplitudes of these events are about 30% - 15%, and the amplitudes reduce with energy. The recovery time of these events shows diverse behaviors of their energy-dependence. Some of them show strong energy-dependence, while some have a nearly constant recovery time. It has been shown that such diverse behaviors could be related with the geometry of the disturbed regions of the interplanetary space by coronal mass ejections (CME), represented by the combined effect of the CME velocity, angular spread, and ejection direction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological constraints from a joint DESI DR1 Full-Shape and DR2 BAO</a><span class="id">[2602.18761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a cosmological analysis combining full-shape (FS) clustering measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR1 with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI DR2. To achieve a robust combination that accounts for the correlation between the two data releases, we employ the ShapeFit compression method and estimate the joint covariance using EZmocks. This compressed approach inherently mitigates the prior volume effects that have previously dominated Bayesian constraints from DESI data with minimal external priors. Consequently, we obtain–for the first time within a Bayesian framework–reliable DESI-only constraints on extensions to $\Lambda$CDM using only a Big Bang Nucleosynthesis prior on the baryon density and a wide prior on the spectral index. In flat $\Lambda$CDM, we find $\Omega_m = 0.3035 \pm 0.0085$, $h = 0.6876 \pm 0.0059$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.822 \pm 0.034$. For the $w_0 w_a$CDM dynamical dark energy model, we measure $w_0 = 0.49 \pm 0.25$ and $w_a = -1.52 \pm 0.77$, improving constraints by $\sim 30\%$ relative to the analogous DR1 measurement and reducing the discrepancy with $\Lambda$CDM to $1.4\sigma$ when compared to BAO only analyses. We also report competitive limits on the sum of neutrino masses and spatial curvature. This work demonstrates that the ShapeFit compression provides a prior-robust and computationally efficient pathway to constrain beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics with large-scale structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of burst oscillations in the newly discovered millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2$-$604207</a><span class="id">[2602.18783]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Burst oscillations during thermonuclear X-ray bursts are powered by thermonuclear energy on the neutron star (NS) surface and typically occur close to the spin frequency of the NS. We performed a comprehensive timing analysis of all thermonuclear bursts from the newly discovered millisecond X-ray pulsar SRGA J144459.2$-$604207, observed with NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR during the 2024 outburst. A total of 39 bursts were detected, allowing for a detailed search for burst oscillations, which had not been previously observed from this source. We report the discovery of burst oscillations at 447.7$-$448.0 Hz from SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 using XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data, consistent with the spin frequency of the NS. The strongest burst oscillation in the XMM-Newton data occurred with a single-trial significance of $5.1\sigma$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\sim31$. In the NuSTAR data, the strongest oscillation signal has a significance of $5.2\sigma$ and maximum $Z^2$ power of $\sim32$. The folded pulse profile corresponding to the strongest signal in the 0.5-10 keV band of the XMM-Newton data shows a sinusoidal shape with a fractional rms amplitude of $\sim8.5\%$, while the measurements of the NuSTAR data (3-40 keV range) yield $\sim21\%$. These results represent the first detection of burst oscillations in SRGA J144459.2$-$604207. Additionally, we report the detection of 447.6 Hz oscillations occurring just before a burst onset observed with XMM-Newton. This marks only the second instance in which burst oscillations have been observed before the burst onset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Martian mid-latitude subsurface ice is the remnant of a past ice sheet</a><span class="id">[2602.18847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On Mars, a relatively pure water ice layer lies beneath several centimeters of dry soil at mid-latitudes. Its widespread presence poleward of 60° latitude was detected by remote neutron spectroscopy and confirmed by the Phoenix lander at 68°N. Recent observations of exposed ice indicate that the near-surface ice layer extends to 35° latitude and exhibits pronounced spatial structure. However, previous models did not capture the observed spatial structure of the midlatitude ice layer. Here, on the basis of improved calculations using the Mars Planetary Climate Model, we show that mid-latitude buried ice could be the remnant of a ice layer deposited on the surface when the obliquity was higher than today. Assuming that the ice subsequently sublimated and became buried beneath a sublimation lag, we estimate that surface ice emplaced 630 kyr (4.18 Myr) ago at 35° obliquity (40°), at latitudes of 40-55°N, would today reside at depths of 25-150 (41-255) cm, depending on the regolith and ice properties. For ice emplaced 630 kyr ago, the modeled burial depths align with observations and capture the observed longitudinal depth variations, in contrast to ice emplaced 4.18 Myr ago.

Cosmological parameters are estimated through $\chi^2$ minimization and MCMC analysis using the emcee algorithm, with model parameters constrained by various observational datasets. Both models reproduce late-time acceleration and remain observationally indistinguishable from $\Lambda$CDM, while allowing small deviations parameterized by $\alpha$ and $n$. The cosmological behavior of the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, the jerk, the snap parameter $s(z)$, and the effective equation of state parameter $\omega$ is also analyzed. The results indicate that the Universe transitioned from deceleration to late-time accelerated expansion, consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model. Analysis of the energy conditions reveals that the NEC and DEC are satisfied, while the SEC is violated, which explains the transition from a decelerating matter-dominated epoch to the present accelerated phase. These findings indicate that the proposed $f(R,T)$ models are compatible with current observational data and provide a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM in describing cosmic acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2017hcc and SN 2023usc a comparative spectroscopic study of type IIn supernovae</a><span class="id">[2602.19010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on a spectroscopic study of the bright, nearby type-IIn supernova SN 2017hcc, and SN 2023usc using data obtained from the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT). SN 2017hcc is well-studied event, and our sampling covers 7 epochs, starting from +14 d post explosion, and continuing into the nebular stage, at +411 d. The type-IIn event SN 2023usc was sampled over 5 epochs from +12 d to +155 d post explosion. The nearly featureless (except H$\alpha$) late time (+62 d onward) spectra of SN 2023usc, suggests a novel explosion route for this type-IIn event. Assuming a CSM model created by multi-epoch ejection of material from the pre-explosion progenitor, we present here a comparative study of both events with several other type-IIn / interacting supernovae in progenitors with persistent signatures of a CSM. We find that true narrow lines ($v \ll 1000$ km s$^{-1}$) emerge in the early ($\sim$ +10 d) spectra only in few events (SN 2017hcc, SN 2023usc and SN 2010jl) initially classified as type-IIn in our sample – in most cases the line velocity hovers at $\sim 1000$ km s$^{-1}$ even in the very early epochs. CSM line velocity being indicative of its extent and opacity, this suggests that progenitors with a highly extended CSMs, which are also optically transparent in their outer regions may be relatively rare.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of Nuclear Urca Process in the Ocean of Neutron-Star Superburst MAXI J1752$-$457</a><span class="id">[2602.19018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose that the rapid cooling of the neutron star following its X-ray superburst in MAXI J1752$-$457 over a period of 4 days, observed by two Japanese satellites, MAXI and NinjaSat, is due to enhanced neutrino emission from cycles of electron capture and $\beta^{-}$ decay involving odd-$A$ nuclei (or Urca pairs) in the ocean. Hence, this work provides the first indication of the possible existence of such a “nuclear Urca process&quot;. The observation of MAXI J1752$-$457 implies a hot ignition layer with a maximum temperature of $\sim4~{\rm GK}$, located near the Urca shell in the ocean, such that the nuclear Urca process becomes dominant for up to $\sim2$ days after the superburst. This behavior is distinct from that of normal Type-I X-ray bursts, which are triggered by hydrogen or helium burning in much shallower layers than those of superbursts. Our findings enable probing of superburst ashes through Urca pairs via long-term monitoring of crust cooling on day-long timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Log-Periodic Modulation in High-Redshift Compact Object Abundance Consistent with Cyclic Condensate Collapse</a><span class="id">[2602.19044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the redshift distribution of high-$z$ galaxies and active galactic nuclei identified in early JWST data, and investigate the presence of periodic structure in the variable $x=\ln(1+z)$. A baseline-corrected unbinned frequency analysis reveals a statistically significant peak corresponding to a spacing $\Delta x \simeq 0.34$, suggesting an approximately log-periodic pattern in the redshift distribution. A periodic structure in $x$ implies a preferred scaling ratio in $(1+z)$, which may be interpreted as a realization of discrete scale invariance. We discuss the possibility that such behavior arises from cyclic condensate dynamics in Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) cosmology. In the Fukuyama–Morikawa–Tatekawa framework, repeated collapse and re-formation episodes of a self-interacting condensate occur over characteristic timescales of order several $10^8$ years. When mapped into redshift space, this temporal periodicity naturally translates into an approximately constant spacing in $\ln(1+z)$. While the observed frequency is not interpreted as a sharp theoretical prediction, its magnitude is quantitatively consistent with the intrinsic cycle timescale of QCD-axion motivated condensate dynamics. The present analysis therefore provides observational support for cyclic BEC cosmology as a viable dynamical origin of log-periodic structure in the high-redshift universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Baryogenesis in $f(R)$ Cosmologies</a><span class="id">[2602.19075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The generation of a baryon-antibaryon asymmetry in the Universe via gravitational baryogenesis is investigated for two f(R) modified theories of gravity, the widely used Starobinsky $f(R)=R+R^{2}/M^{2}$ model, and the recently proposed power-law model $f(R)=c_{1}R^{2+k/4}+c_{2}R+c_{3}$ of Odintsov and Oikonomou (2025) that is constructed from the slow-roll inflation parameters, and fits the new high-multipole CMB observations reported by the Planck and ACT collaborations for $k \sim -0.03$. The present investigation is undertaken in the Einstein frame. The motion of the scalaron is studied for the slow roll inflationary era using analytic approximate solutions obtained from its potential and, from these solutions, analytic expressions for the Ricci scalar, its time derivative, the Hubble parameter and the scale factor of the Universe. These expressions for the Starobinsky model were obtained first by Motohashi and Nishizawa (2012) but the expressions for the power-law model of Odintsov and Oikonomou and its generalization are new. The calculated values of the baryon asymmetry factor $\eta $ for the Starobinsky model vary from $(1.05 - 1.46) \times 10^{-11}$, and for the power-law model, from $(1.06 - 1.53) \times 10^{-11}$. The power-law values depend upon the unknown fitting parameters $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$, and a future fit of the Odintsov and Oikonomou model to data could yield enhanced values. The values for $\eta$ depend upon a mass parameter $M_{\ast}$ which is expected to be of the order of $M_{Pl}=2.435 \times 10^{18}$ GeV. The values of $\eta$ for both models have been calculated for $M_{\ast}=M_{Pl}$ and are quite close to the observed value $\eta = 8.65 \times 10^{-11}$. Since $\eta \propto (M/M_{\ast})^{2}$, reducing $M_{\ast}$ slightly from $M_{Pl}$ to $0.4 M_{Pl}$ would bring the calculated values into agreement with the observed value.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exponential Quintessence Model: Analytical Quantification of the Fine-Tuning Problem in Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2602.19118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we investigate a quintessence field with an exponential potential motivated by the suggestion of time-varying dark energy from the DESI galaxy survey.

In the southwestern region, the forward shock is thought to have reached the cavity wall, encountering diverse environmental conditions. We report on the spatially resolved X-ray polarimetric observation of RCW 86 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). In the 2–4.5 keV energy band we find no significant detection of polarization. Employing a dedicated background subtraction procedure and Bayesian spectropolarimetric fitting, we derive 99% upper limits on the polarization degree of the synchrotron component: 15% in higher-statistics regions and 30%–40% in lower-statistics regions. These upper limits on the polarization degree in several regions exclude the possibility of a strongly coherent magnetic field down to the subparsec scale, and that of a moderately coherent one on the scale of the synchrotron features as resolved by IXPE. The results indicate that the shocks in the southwestern rim of RCW 86 propagate more slowly than the unshocked ejecta at their locations, yet exceed the measured proper motion speeds. This behavior is consistent with reflected shocks occurring in tenuous regions of the shocked ejecta, distinct from regions that are radio-bright.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Apparent Asymmetric Outflows of TeV Particles from Pulsar Winds</a><span class="id">[2602.19211]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of X-ray filaments attached to a couple of powerful pulsars suggest escape of TeV electrons and/or positrons (e$^{\pm}$) from pulsar bow shocks into surrounding large scale magnetic fields.

We develop a Monte Carlo code to simulate particle transport in a large scale magnetic field and apply the model to PSR B2224+4415 (Guitar). It is shown that, with an injection power of a few tens of percent of the pulsar spin down luminosity, TeV e$^{\pm}$ can explain the observed filament properties with a scattering mean free path along the magnetic field comparable to the length of the observed filament. The model predicts a dim diffuse symmetric X-ray background aligned with the filament on a larger scale, whose flux is proportional to the X-ray emitting e$^{\pm}$ energy loss time for a stable e$^{\pm}$ injection power comparable to the luminosity of this diffuse background. Observations with a large field of view and good sensitivity should be able to detect such a component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Potential periodic signals in blazars: significance, forecasting and deep learning</a><span class="id">[2602.19214]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blazars exhibit variable emission on diverse timescales. Some light curves show signs of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs), which may encode clues regarding the physical processes behind the emission or point to supermassive binary black holes. We analyzed five blazars with previously reported high significance year-long QPOs, applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and Weighted Wavelet Z-transform methods to Fermi-LAT data up to early 2025. We furthermore examined an additional source (PKS 0139-09), where nascent QPO may be present. As the light curves showed longer term trends, we detrended the data using an STL decomposition, which often revealed a large seasonal component. We find that detrending generally leads to an increase in the strength of the QPO signal. However, except for PG 1553+113, where a clearly persistent QPO signal is present, we detect transience on a timescale of $\lesssim$4000 days. We then forecast the light curves over the following four years, using a traditional statistical method as well as a Transformer-based deep learning model. Applied to a test set, the latter showed significant success in predicting behavior that seems unexpected from simple inspection of the past data. Analyzing the extended time series suggests a markedly weaker QPO signals over the coming years in cases where the transient behavior appears near the end of the observational data. In contrast, in the nascent candidate QPO source (PKS 0139-09) the signal is expected to strengthen significantly. These predictions, which may reflect the physical origin of the QPOs, can be tested against future data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parameter Estimation Limits in Blazars</a><span class="id">[2602.19301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Parameter degeneracy in blazar spectral energy distributions (SEDs) is known but rarely quantified. This paper introduces a Fisher Information approach to determine theoretical limits to information extraction in the context of one-zone models. By evaluating the total Fisher Information by varying $\delta$, $B$, $p$, $\gamma_{\rm min}$ and $\gamma_{\rm max}$, we find that EC models encode Fisher information $\gtrsim10^4$ times less than that in SSC models, establishing differences in limits of physical information extraction even in the case of perfect sampling. Moreover, the Fisher information in both SSC and EC models exhibit strong fluctuations across the parameter space, but since the magnitudes are orders of magnitude lower in EC, limits of parameter inference are expected to be worse in FSRQ SEDs than BL Lacs. We also find that the Doppler factor $\delta$ carries at least $10^{2-3}$ more Fisher information than that for $p$ and $B$ in both EC and SSC, making $\delta$ the most constrained SED parameter. Applying our Fisher Information motivated framework to real flaring SEDs of Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs) CTA 102 and 3C 279, we show that mild variations in $\delta$ and $p$ can appreciably produce the flaring SEDs starting from the quiescent model, while two other flares in 3C 279 simple geometric and spectral considerations cannot reproduce the flares, reducing the efficacy of one-zone models. We propose that time-resolved SED models are indispensable to constraining physical parameters in EC-dominated blazars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19335" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the maximum energy of fast radio bursts using thousands of sources from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog</a><span class="id">[2602.19335]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantifying the maximum energy of fast radio bursts (FRBs) can provide stringent constraints on their emission mechanisms and progenitor models. However, the most energetic bursts are rare, requiring a large sample of FRBs to detect them. In this work, we use the largest available such sample, 2,998 one-off FRBs from the Second CHIME/FRB Catalog, to obtain a lower limit on the maximum energy ($E^{\mathrm{max}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$) of FRBs, assuming isotropic energy distribution from FRB sources. In the absence of known redshifts ($z$) for most sources, we present a framework that uses the dispersion measures (DMs) and fluences of these FRBs, together with the probability distribution of $z$ given DM, to derive the lower limit on $E^{\mathrm{max}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$. We generate simulated FRB samples assuming different parameter values for a log-normal $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{host}}$ distribution and a Schechter function form of the FRB energy function to estimate how many outliers – FRBs with large DM contributions from the host galaxy or intervening galaxy halos – could artificially inflate this limit. After accounting for outliers, the lower limit on $E^{\mathrm{max}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$ from Catalog 2 FRBs ranges between $1.2\times10^{41}$ and $1.9\times10^{42}$ erg, with best estimate $1.2\times10^{42}$ erg. This limit is consistent with those derived from much smaller FRB samples. Moreover, inferred energies of hundreds of FRBs appear collectively limited around $\sim10^{42}$ erg, suggesting a physical limit on the energy reservoir of FRB sources. The corresponding isotropic-equivalent FRB source energy is consistent with the total energy available in a magnetar's external dipole magnetic field, supporting magnetars as FRB progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Certified Uncertainty for Surrogate Models of Neutron Star Equations of State via Mondrian Conformal Prediction</a><span class="id">[2602.19363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multitask surrogate for neutron-star equations of state (EoSs) that delivers \emph{distribution-free}, certified uncertainty via split conformal prediction (CP) and its Mondrian variant.

Trained on a balanced set of $40{,}000$ EoSs, the model attains near-perfect discrimination (AUC $\approx 0.997$) and sub-percent relative errors for masses and radii, with few-percent error for tidal deformability. Across $\alpha\in[0.05,0.25]$, empirical coverages closely track $1-\alpha$ for both Standard and Mondrian CP; in conservative regimes, Mondrian yields narrower average physical widths at comparable coverage.

We analyze its geopotential, surface acceleration, escape speeds, slopes, and equilibrium points, and we also search for planar symmetric periodic orbits using an equivalent ellipsoidal approximation. Our results indicate that the lowest geopotential values occur at the poles, which also correspond to regions of maximum surface acceleration. The global slope distribution suggests preferred zones of material accumulation or migration, offering clues to Justitia's long-term morphological evolution. Most slopes remain below $40^\circ$, implying that loose particles may settle stably across large portions of the surface. We identify five equilibrium points consistent with Justitia's estimated density and slow rotational period. Two external points (E$_2$ and E$_4$) exhibit linear stability, and all equilibrium locations lie relatively far from the surface due to the body's slow spin. Additionally, we discover 28 new families of planar symmetric periodic orbits, then classify their topologies and determine their linear stability, providing a dynamical framework relevant to future spacecraft operations near Justitia. Finally, thermal modeling reveals how thermal inertia and heliocentric distance shape Justitia's temperature distribution. The south pole receives more insolation than the north pole, reaching minimum temperatures of about 102 K and 87 K, respectively. These combined dynamical and thermal results offer valuable insights for the EMA mission and for understanding slowly rotating small bodies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19478" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hydrostatic Mass Bias and the $σ_8$ Tension: A Multi-Probe Forecast for Stage-IV/V Surveys</a><span class="id">[2602.19478]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The hydrostatic mass bias ($b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$) is a leading systematic uncertainty in cluster cosmology and a principal source of degeneracy with $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_m$.

We perform a Fisher forecast incorporating realistic survey noise, foreground modeling for clustered CIB and radio sources, and full marginalization over cosmological and astrophysical nuisance parameters, including per-bin galaxy bias perturbations, photometric redshift shifts, intrinsic alignments, and baryonic feedback modeled with HMCode2020. With optimized tomographic binning (10 lens and 5 source bins for LSST; 6 lens and 5 source bins for CSST), we forecast marginalized constraints of $0.98\%$ for SO+LSST, $1.60\%$ for CMB-S4+LSST, and $2.40\%$ for CMB-S4+CSST. Tomography improves $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$ precision by factors of approximately three relative to non-tomographic analyses, reflecting the role of redshift information in breaking the $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$–$\sigma_8$ degeneracy. Optical-only probes provide no direct constraint on $b_{\mathrm{HSE}}$, whereas inclusion of tSZ-containing spectra enables percent-level calibration under realistic systematic assumptions.

However, the complexity of the merger process complicates the interpretation of the associated gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals. This picture becomes even more complex in the potential scenario in which dark matter accumulates around and in neutron stars, altering their structure and the associated observables. In this work, we study synthetic gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star mergers with next-generation detectors, investigating their potential to extract both nuclear physics and dark-matter constraints. We also examine how the potential presence of fermionic, non-interacting dark matter inside neutron stars affects the inference of nuclear empirical parameters. We find that combining observations can tighten constraints on nuclear empirical parameters. However, the inferred values remain sensitive to systematic modeling biases and intrinsic degeneracies among the parameters. Conversely, our analysis reveals that even in the presence of dark matter, it will be unlikely to find decisive evidence for dark matter when analyzing gravitational-wave signals. Consequently, systematic biases in nuclear empirical parameter inference potentially resulting from the presence of dark matter are expected to be negligible even for observations with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weak S-type asteroids compared to C-type explain the observed size distribution of the main belt</a><span class="id">[2602.19656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The main belt, the region between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, is home to more than 1 million asteroids. These asteroids form orbital groups, (i.e., asteroid families formed by collisions) and also spectral groups (taxonomies) with different chemical compositions, in particular carbonaceous (C-types) and silicate (S-types). In this paper, we extend the existing main-belt collisional model by finding the appropriate strength-versus-size dependence (also known as the scaling law) for these two groups. We used color indices and geometric albedos of 56 and 72 spectroscopically confirmed C- and S-types (control samples), along with statistical methods on 1 065 034 asteroids, to assign C-, S-, or other types. This allowed us to construct observed size-frequency distributions (SFDs) for several subpopulations constrained by either semimajor axis (inner, middle, outer) or taxonomy (C, S, other). Then we used a Monte Carlo collisional model to compute the long-term collisional evolution (4.5 billion years) and derive synthetic SFDs. Our best-fit scaling laws indicate that S-types must be weaker below approximately 0.2 km than C-types to explain the deficiency of asteroids in the inner part of the main belt near (and below) the observational limit. This may correspond to differences in chemical composition or material porosity. Future research will focus on the scaling laws of asteroids with rare or &quot;extreme&quot; taxonomies (e.g., V, M).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influence of Cross-sectional Expansion on Coronal Emissions from a Radiatively Cooling Solar Flare Loop</a><span class="id">[2602.19688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Loop-aligned hydrodynamic modelings help better understand the thermodynamic evolution of flaring plasma confined in solar flare loops. Conventional loop modelings typically assume a uniform loop cross section. With a variation of the cross section taken into account, in this work we carry out both analytical and numerical modelings of the radiative cooling in a solar flare loop. It is found that a cross-sectional expansion with height can efficiently suppress the draining of loop material from the corona while not significantly affecting the decrease of loop temperature. Reflected to the loop energetics, the coronal part of the loop cools more dominantly by radiation, and more importantly, the loop radiative outputs are shifted toward lower temperatures. These findings pose important physical implications for extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) late-phase emissions discovered in some solar flares. The late-phase loops in these flares are believed to bear a more notable cross-sectional expansion owing to their longer lengths. Compared with the main-phase loops, the late-phase loops would emit more effectively at middle temperatures, which could, to a certain degree, mitigate the severe heating requirement for the production of a prominent warm coronal late-phase peak. In addition, the cross-sectional expansion also affects the shape of the emission lights curves, causing a sharper decay after the emission peak. Such an emission pattern has been validated with the observations of an EUV late-phase flare, and could serve as a potential diagnostic tool to judge the degree of loop cross-sectional expansion in an extended flare dataset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Young system development in a cometary globule: An investigation into the eccentric disk around AT Pyx in terms of planet-formation and interaction with its surrounding environment</a><span class="id">[2602.19755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents new data and analyses of the AT Pyx system, a disk-hosting young star located in a cometary globule in the Gum Nebula. This radiation-driven structure is an unusual environment for observations of planet formation and differs greatly from the low-mass star-forming regions disks are most commonly observed in. Aided by a collection of visual and spectroscopic data available for this system, this paper aims to infer the possibility of embedded planets existing within the disk and how the system's environment may affect its disk morphology. Using data from the VLT's instruments XSHOOTER, ESPRESSO and - most prominently - SPHERE along with data from ALMA, we make a variety of measurements (geometric, photometric and otherwise) to characterise the observed disk features and attributes such as spiral arms and eccentricity. Mapping of the velocity components is also undertaken using the ALMA gas line data to characterise disk orientation and determine the likelihood that the system is experiencing a late-stage infall event. The disk is found to be eccentric when deprojected. Under the assumption that the formation of a planet is wholly responsible for the primary and secondary spiral arms, we find the mass of such a planet can range between 0.004 and 3 Jupiter masses. Measurement of the velocities associated with nearby globule cloud material returns reasonable velocities for a late-stage infall event. We estimate far-ultraviolet field strength at AT Pyx's location to be low in comparison to other surveyed disks. We also find that AT Pyx is possibly a binary system. AT Pyx is the first disk within a cometary globule to be spatially resolved, and is now the first such disk to be investigated to this extent. The work of this paper could potentially be a first step into the further study of disks in the moderate-FUV environment of the Gum Nebula and its globules.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Hole Formation in Rastall Gravity: Shifted Collapse Threshold and Exponential Abundance Sensitivity</a><span class="id">[2602.19826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes formed in the early universe are compelling candidates for dark matter.

Analyz- ing cosmological perturbations during radiation domination, we demonstrate that the Rastall parameter fundamentally alters the collapse dynamics, modifying the growth of density fluctuations, the critical threshold for black hole formation, and the fluctuation amplitude at horizon crossing. Current cosmological constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and large-scale structure restrict the Rastall parameter to small values, yet within this allowed range PBH production can be altered by orders of magnitude compared to general relativity.

Our study analyzes a sample of 96 C-, M-, and X-class flares observed between 2013 and 2015 with soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and extreme UV. For each event, we determine the time delay {\Delta}t between the hard X-ray and soft X-ray peak, and estimate the flare loop length L from UV footpoints assuming a semicircular geometry. In every case, longer flare loops are consistently associated with larger timing delays. Across the full sample, we find a strong correlation, R = 0.88 between L and {\Delta}t. We also quantify how closely each flare follows the Neupert effect using a coefficient RN, defined as the Pearson correlation between the time derivative of the soft X-ray flux and the hard X-ray light curve. Applying correlation thresholds of RN &gt; 0.5 and RN &gt; 0.8 yields subsets of 87 and 46 events, respectively. In both cases, the linear relationship between loop length and peak delay remains clearly expressed. For the RN &gt; 0.5 subset, the correlation is R = 0.87, while the more selective subset with RN &gt; 0.8 displays an even stronger correlation of R = 0.91. These results show that the overall trend persists across increasingly stringent correlation thresholds. The results provide direct observational confirmation that magnetic loop geometry plays a key role in governing the temporal evolution of energy transport in solar flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apophis source population and Earth encounter frequency of Apophis-like bodies</a><span class="id">[2602.19849]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We provide context for Apophis' 2029 Earth passage by analyzing its possible source populations, in particular, the Flora family, which has a similar composition, corresponding to LL chondrite meteorites. Out of ${\sim}3380$ NEOs larger or equal than Apophis (${\ge}420\,{\rm m}$), $610\pm 140$ are LL-like NEOs from Flora. Their mean encounter probability is $p = 86\times 10^{-18}\,{\rm km}^{-2}\,{\rm y}^{-1}$, corresponding to once per 13000 y frequency of encounters closer than 38000 km. However, this does not apply to Apophis alone, for which the specific encounter probability is higher, $p' = 1603\times 10^{-18}\,{\rm km}^{-2}\,{\rm y}^{-1}$, but the frequency is lower, only once per 430000 y, when we consider it as a single object. Our simulation of the Flora family over $\sim$1 billion years indicates that Apophis-like bodies have orbits that are particularly persistent in near-Earth space. The temporal distribution of encounter probabilities exhibits peaks (up to ${&gt;}10^4$ in the same units) and the specific value for Apophis is not unusual (occurring ${\sim}70\%$ of time). In other words, there is always at least one Apophis-like body among NEOs. We find that such persistence also creates favorable opportunities for temporary capture as Earth coorbitals. Apophis-like bodies are ultimately removed from the inner solar system by approaching the Sun or by impact into one of the terrestrial planets, where the relative split between these outcomes is $(45\pm 2)\,\%$ and $(50\pm 2)\,\%$. While our current knowledge of Apophis' orbit guarantees no threat from Apophis in the next few centuries, we cannot predict any specific outcome for Apophis in the coming thousands or millions of years. Evaluating this statistically over the long term, we find that objects in Apophis-like orbits have a $(19\pm 2)\,\%$ chance of Earth impact over their lifetime of ${\sim}30\,{\rm My}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating polarization signatures from GRB models</a><span class="id">[2602.19921]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is still much debate around the inner workings of the GRB prompt emission phase with many questions still left unanswered. Polarization signatures offer a promising new avenue to discriminate between the various GRB prompt emission models. The aim of this study is to estimate energy and time resolved polarization signatures resulting from Inverse Compton (IC) scattering for two specific GRB prompt emission models, namely the backscatter-dominated cork model by \citet{Vyas2} and a Compton drag model by \citet{Lazzati2}. In order to achieve this we apply an IC polarization Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm to those two GRB models in order to estimate the expected polarization signatures. For the backscatter-dominated cork model we find polarization signatures below $\sim 10$ \%, likely below the detection limits of current or near-future X-ray and $\gamma$-ray polarimeters. Our results for the Compton drag model indicates polarization results consistent with that found by \citet{Lazzati3}.

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) Ka-band (9.1 mm) observations of the disk around MWC 480, and infer dust properties through a combined analysis with archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data at 0.87, 1.17, 1.33, and 3.0 mm. The prominent dust ring at 95 au (B95) is detected at 9.1 mm for the first time, while the faint outer ring at 160 au is not revealed. Through non-parametric visibility modeling, we identified two new annular features: a plateau within 20-50 au across all wavelengths, and a shoulder exterior to the B95 ring at 0.87, 1.17 and 1.33 mm, consistent with signatures of planet-disk interaction. We find that the width of the B95 ring remains constant across wavelengths, suggesting that fragmentation dominates over radial diffusion or that unresolved substructure is present within the ring. Resolved spectral modeling yields two families of dust solutions that reproduce the observations equally well: compact grains or highly porous (90\%) grains, with carbonaceous components dominated by refractory organics or amorphous carbon, respectively. The inferred maximum grain sizes peak at the locations of the two rings and reach centimeter within the B95 ring. The total dust masses are $860^{+95}_{-78}\rm~M_\oplus$/$1500^{+440}_{-330}\rm~M_\oplus$ (large/small-grain solution in inner disk) and $230^{+14}_{-13}\rm~M_\oplus$ for the two dust mixtures. The B95 ring alone contains $100^{+5}_{-5}\rm~M_\oplus$ and $43^{+2}_{-2}\rm~M_\oplus$, respectively, sufficient to assemble the cores of giant planets.

The same puzzle exists for the stellar coronae heating as well. In this study, we present a series of findings on solar spicules and their subsequent impact on the corona within a coronal hole environment, characterized by locally open magnetic field lines, combining insights from MHD simulations with observations. We find that the convective and turbulent motions around the solar surface cause plenty of shocks and small-scale magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere. The combined effects of shock compression and reconnection outflows then drive the formation of groups of spicules with a quasi-period of about $300$ s and width of $\sim 200-500$ km. The spicule upflows provide an averaged mass flux above $10^{-9}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ in the lower corona to sustain the solar wind in coronal holes, and they continuously trigger further new local slow-mode waves and shocks. These waves supply an energy flux of $10-100$ W m$^{-2}$ in the lower corona, and they are dissipated by heat conduction and compression heating to sustain the corona temperature of about $1$ MK. The results also indicate that the upward propagating disturbances (PDs) observed in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) passbands are caused by both spicule upflows and slow-mode waves and shocks. Our findings help to understand the long standing problem of coronal heating and the origin of solar winds in coronal hole regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19986" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LRG-BEASTS: Detection of sodium and evidence for water absorption in the hot Saturn HAT-P-44b</a><span class="id">[2602.19986]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the low-resolution optical transmission spectrum of the inflated hot Saturn HAT-P-44b.

Using the “photoeccentric effect” in a hierarchical Bayesian framework, we first model the population using discrete planetary size bins (sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, and Jovians). We then develop a continuous mixture model with weights governed by a logistic sigmoid function of radius. We find that the warm-single population is best described by two components: a dominant low-eccentricity mode ( &lt;e_low&gt; = 0.070-0.068+0.026) and a secondary dynamically excited mode (&lt;e_high&gt; = 0.616-0.075+0.091). The fraction of planets belonging to this high-eccentricity component increases strongly with planet radius, characterized by a transition at a break radius of R_br = 9.8-1.1+1.4 R_e. This trend places warm sub-Saturns predominantly on the same low-eccentricity track as sub-Neptunes. In contrast, warm Jovians (8–16 R_e) are frequently eccentric, with 59+-13% of the population in the high eccentricity mode. We detect this bimodality at &gt;4sigma, providing statistically significant evidence that warm gas giants are sculpted by two distinct pathways, or a single mechanism with subsequent eccentricity excitation. Finally, we identify a non-negligible tail of highly eccentric sub-Neptunes (1–4 R_e), which comprise 14.9-6.5+5.1% of the population, consistent with excitation by non-transiting external companions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic strings and domain walls: the impact of CMB $B$-mode data</a><span class="id">[2602.20050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse CMB constraints on stable networks of cosmic strings and domain walls using for the first time full Planck 2018 data together with BICEP/Keck 2018 $B$-mode measurements.

In the tidally locked limit, the nightside's tendency to radiatively cool and potentially trap volatiles as permanent ice introduces a strong dependence of habitability on the planet's surface and atmospheric boundary conditions. We perform a suite of synchronously rotating experiments spanning a wide range of topographic and orographic realizations with different mean elevations and landmass distributions. Across a grid of $p_{\mathrm{N2}} = 0.5$-$8~\mathrm{bar}$ and $F_{\star} = 1200$-$1700~\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$, we find that surface relief breaks the flow symmetry, replacing the circumpolar vortices with mechanically forced stationary waves. Steep orography produces standing Rossby gyres that strengthen the cross-terminator jet and align vertical uplift with the day–night boundary. These new circulation regimes enhance moisture transport, increasing the infrared optical depth and promoting additional nightside cloud formation, which produces a stronger cloud-greenhouse feedback and lower the critical fluxes required for global planetary deglaciation. Broad, elevated plateaus drive a similarly fragmented but slightly weaker circulation, yielding less effective moisture transport. These results show that the relief and spatial distribution of landmasses, parameters unconstrained for most exoplanets, can exert strong controls on the climatic bifurcations of tidally locked M-dwarf exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter in Zwicky's Cosmology: Towards an Epistemological Reconstruction</a><span class="id">[2602.18475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new contextualised reading of Fritz Zwicky's 1933 article ”The redshift of extragalactic nebulae” about the virial analysis of the velocity dispersion of galaxies in the Coma cluster leads to a reconsideration of the traditional discourse on the introduction of dark matter. We argue that this component of matter was not only already on the stage of the scientific debates of the time, but also, in a more concealed form, played a central role in Zwicky's epistemic context. We thus reject the narration that dark matter is the result of a “na{ï}ve” astrophysical observation and emphasise the cosmological motivations that prompted Zwicky to presciently search for it. Moreover, with regard to its abundance, we argue that the discrepancy between the observed amount of luminous matter in the Coma Cluster and Zwicky's higher mass estimate derived from virial analysis was not, in fact, astonishing. What Zwicky described as a surprising excess of dark matter was of precisely the order of magnitude he had set out to identify. Consequently, we challenge the widespread view that dark matter was merely an ad hoc hypothesis introduced to rescue Newtonian theory. Instead, we suggest it may represent one of the earliest cosmological indications supporting a new emerging theory of gravitation: General Relativity. This reinterpretation contributes to ongoing debates in the philosophy of science concerning the epistemic status of ad hoc hypotheses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18580" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Constraints on Long-Lived Particles Using Dimension-Six Effective Operators</a><span class="id">[2602.18580]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-lived particles (LLPs) provide an interesting window into physics beyond the Standard Model, offering characteristic signatures at colliders and in cosmology.

We compare unperturbed accretion with a case featuring plasma density bubbles with pressure balanced magnetic islands of different amplitudes. Power spectrum analysis of accretion time series, performed via the Blackman-Tukey method, shows that the perturbed case exhibits (1) steeper spectral indices compared to the unperturbed case, deviating from the characteristic $1/\omega$ noise spectrum, and (2) increased correlation times, providing evidence for absorption of macro-structures at the event horizon. Spatial auto-correlation analysis of near-horizon turbulence confirms larger energy-containing coherent structures in the perturbed case altering the accretion rate.

For each posterior sample, we compute the pasta sequence within a compressible liquid-drop model and quantify the onset density, thickness, and mass fraction of the pasta layers. We show that the appearance and extent of nuclear pasta are primarily controlled by the symmetry-energy slope parameter $L$. While spherical and rod-like pasta configurations are present for all equations of state, only a small fraction of the posterior supports slab, tube, or bubble geometries. The transition from spherical nuclei to rods is tightly constrained to occur at a density of $\rho_{\rm sr} = 0.0588^{+0.0045}_{-0.0065}\,\mathrm{fm^{-3}}$. We further predict that the nuclear pasta layer occupies a relative radial thickness of $\Delta R_{\rm pasta}/\Delta R_{\rm c} = 0.140^{+0.025}_{-0.036}$ and contributes a relative mass fraction of $\Delta M_{\rm pasta}/\Delta M_{\rm c} = 0.475^{+0.071}_{-0.113}$. Using the resulting crust models, we present the first quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) analysis based on a Bayesian posterior ensemble of neutron-star equations of state and systematically assess their compatibility with observed low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations.

Within a unified dynamical framework, we analyze test-particle motion in a broad class of dark-matter-embedded geometries, including singular black holes, regular black holes, naked singularities, and Einstein-cluster configurations. We show that environmental perturbations generically break integrability in the strong-field regime, giving rise to chaotic motion whose onset, duration, and termination depend sensitively on horizon structure, core regularization, and matter distribution. Using the numerical Kludge approach, we demonstrate that chaotic trajectories produce systematic qualitative modifications of the emitted gravitational radiation, such as irregular amplitude modulation and loss of phase coherence, in contrast to the smooth, quasi-periodic waveforms generated by regular motion. Our results establish the robustness of chaos in environmentally perturbed EMRIs and provide a clear conceptual link between nonlinear orbital dynamics, spacetime structure, and observable gravitational-wave signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leptophilic scalar dark matter in U(1)$_{L_μ-L_τ}$: Evading direct detection and prospective neutron star heating</a><span class="id">[2602.19958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Leptophilic dark matter (DM) is a well-motivated thermal WIMP framework that can evade stringent nuclear-recoil searches while remaining testable via DM-induced heating of neutron stars (NS). In this work, we study leptophilic scalar DM in a $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, which provides a common leptophilic portal for all scenarios considered. To reproduce the observed relic abundance while suppressing direct-detection signals, we investigate three benchmark realizations: (i) a secluded DM scenario in which the relic density is set by annihilation into $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge bosons, and two pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) DM models based on (ii) an SO(4) symmetry and (iii) an SO(3) symmetry. In the SO(4) pNGB model, the DM mass arises at tree level from a soft breaking term, while the elastic scattering amplitude is suppressed by a symmetry-protected cancellation. In the SO(3) pNGB model, the DM mass is generated radiatively at one loop via the $\mathrm{U(1)}_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge interaction, and we show that this gauging preserves the same cancellation mechanism, maintaining compatibility with direct-detection null results. We perform a systematic parameter scan imposing relic density, direct- and indirect-detection, and neutrino trident constraints, and identify viable sub-TeV to TeV DM candidates. Assuming maximal capture in NSs, we find that the remaining parameter space can be tested by near-infrared observations of NSs, providing sensitivity complementary to terrestrial searches in regions that are currently weakly constrained.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addressing leakage and mode suppression in angular power spectrum estimation for gravitational-wave backgrounds using pulsar timing arrays</a><span class="id">[2602.20075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mapping gravitational-wave background (GWB) anisotropy with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is affected by harmonic-space mode suppression and mode coupling arising from an array's nonuniform sky response. Spherical harmonic expansions must be truncated at finite multipole l_max^rec, often set to l_max^N_pair$\equiv {\rm int}\left[\sqrt{\text{N_pair}}-1\right]$, where N_pair is the number of distinct pulsar pairs in an array. This choice is motivated by the counting argument that cross-correlations provide at most N_pair independent constraints. We obtain the multipole l_max^res corresponding to the maximum informative angular scale of a PTA. It is defined such that expansions to l_max^res (approximately) span the space of &quot;observable skies&quot; encoded in the N_pair eigenmaps of the Fisher information matrix, and therefore depends on the array configuration. We explicitly show that GWB power contained in multipoles l$\gtrsim$l_max^res do not significantly affect analyses that use expansions out to l_max^res, because the PTA response acts as a low-pass filter. In contrast, truncating at l_max^rec&lt; l_max^res leads to leakage of small-scale angular power from l_max^rec&lt;l$\leq$l_max^res. Even choosing l_max^rec=l_max^res, the standard frequentist estimator of the angular power spectrum C_l remains biased by the modes unobservable by the array. Although we can (partially) debias the standard estimator – improving its agreement with an injected spectrum – this reduction in bias comes at the expense of an increase in variance, particularly for poorly constrained modes with l$\gg$l_eff. We therefore recommend: (i) using l_max^res for PTA analyses involving spherical harmonic expansions, and (ii) using the debiased standard estimator for C_l recovery, but only out to multipoles l&lt;l_eff ($\ll$l_max^res) corresponding to sufficiently constrained modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leptonic originated High energy neutrinos from astrophysical objects</a><span class="id">[1801.07677]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy neutrinos are traditionally regarded as unambiguous signatures of hadronic cosmic rays in astrophysical environments.

In the spectra of the kilonova AT2017gfo, a P Cygni line at about 1$\mu$m has been linked to Sr II, providing the first direct evidence of freshly synthesised $r$-process material. An alternative explanation to Sr II was proposed - He I $\lambda 1083.3$nm under certain non-local-thermodynamic-equilibrium (NLTE) conditions. A key way to robustly discriminate between these identifications, and indeed other proposed identifications, is to analyse the temporal emergence and evolution of the feature. In this analysis we trace the earliest appearance of the observed feature and detail its spectro-temporal evolution, which we compare with a collisional-radiative model of helium. We show that the 1$\mu$m P Cygni line is inconsistent with a He I interpretation both in emergence time and in subsequent spectral evolution. Self-consistent helium masses cannot reproduce the observed feature, due to the diminishing strength of radiative pathways leaving triplet helium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21383" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Do Stars Turn Red?

Post-Main-Sequence Expansion Mechanism</a><span class="id">[2407.21383]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this series of papers, we address the long-standing question of why post-main-sequence stars expand into red giants (RGs) or red supergiants (RSGs). This paper aims to identify the key physical mechanism that drives stellar evolution toward the RG/RSG phase. Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), we perform controlled numerical experiments by systematically varying stellar parameters in evolutionary models, and compare those that successfully evolve into RG/RSGs and those that do not. We show that envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase cannot be explained by energy absorption. Instead, it is governed by a refined form of the &quot;mirror principle,&quot; in which the stellar envelope responds oppositely to its inner boundary, defined by the outer edge of the hydrogen-burning shell, rather than directly to the helium core. This behavior arises naturally from hydrostatic equilibrium, as the burning shell establishes a moving, nearly constant-pressure inner boundary for the envelope. We identify two evolutionary pathways toward the RG/RSG phase that both follow this refined mirror principle: (1) direct envelope expansion during helium-core contraction, and (2) continued expansion after contraction ceases, driven by a decline in nuclear energy generation rate. The final approach to the RG/RSG phase is marked by a structural transition in the envelope, characterized by mass redistribution and the development of an extended convective region. We present a unified physical framework for envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase, based on the refined mirror principle and the final structural transition, and outline an evolutionary roadmap leading to the RG/RSG phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helium as an Indicator of the Neutron-Star Merger Remnant Lifetime and its Potential for Equation of State Constraints</a><span class="id">[2411.03427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The time until black hole formation in a binary neutron-star (NS) merger contains invaluable information about the nuclear equation of state (EoS) but has thus far been difficult to measure. We propose a new way to constrain the merger remnant's NS lifetime, which is based on the tendency of the NS remnant neutrino-driven winds to enrich the ejected material with helium. Based on the He I $\lambda 1083.3$ nm line, we show that the feature around 800-1200 nm in AT2017gfo at 4.4 days seems inconsistent with a helium mass fraction of $X_{\mathrm{He}} \gtrsim 0.05$ in the polar ejecta. Our recent neutrino-hydrodynamic simulations of merger remnants are only compatible with this limit if the NS remnant collapses within 20-30 ms. Such a short lifetime implies that the total binary mass of GW170817, $M_\mathrm{\rm tot}$, lay close to the threshold binary mass for direct gravitational collapse, $M_\mathrm{thres}$, for which we estimate $M_{\mathrm{thres}}\lesssim 2.93 M_\odot$. This upper bound on $M_\mathrm{thres}$ yields upper limits on the radii and maximum mass of cold, non-rotating NSs, which rule out simultaneously large values for both quantities. In combination with causality arguments, this result implies a maximum NS mass of $M_\mathrm{max}\lesssim2.3 M_\odot$. The combination of all limits constrains the radii of 1.6 M$_\odot$ NSs to about 12$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.0 M$_\odot$ and 11.5$\pm$1 km for $M_\mathrm{max}$ = 2.15 M$_\odot$. This $\sim2$ km allowable range then tightens significantly for $M_\mathrm{max}$ above $\approx2.15$ M$_\odot$. This rules out a significant number of current EoS models. The short NS lifetime also implies that a black-hole torus, not a highly magnetized NS, was the central engine powering the relativistic jet of GRB170817A. Our work motivates future developments...

The enhancement is a consequence of the resonance between the frequency of the fundamental quadrupolar $^2f$-mode of oscillation of the proto-neutron star and the frequency of the epicyclic oscillations at the boundary of the inner core. We observe periods of about several hundred milliseconds each where the resonance is active. The GW emission enhancement produces a correlated resonant modulation of the associated neutrino signal at the same frequencies. With GW frequencies of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{kHz})$ and strain amplitudes within the sensitivity curves of current and next-generation interferometers at distances of $\mathcal{O}(1\,\mathrm{Mpc})$, this resonant-amplification mechanism may represent a potential game-changer for unveiling the supernova explosion mechanism through multimessenger astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective field theory of coupled dark energy and dark matter</a><span class="id">[2504.17293]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We formulate an effective field theory (EFT) of coupled dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM) interacting through energy and momentum transfers.

This prescription allows one to accommodate shift-symmetric and non-shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories by taking a particular weak coupling limit, with and without consistency conditions respectively. We deal with the DM sector as a non-relativistic perfect fluid, which can be described by a system of three scalar fields. By choosing a unitary gauge in which the perturbations in the DE and DM sectors are eaten by the metric, we incorporate the leading-order operators that characterize the energy and momentum transfers besides those present in the conventional EFT of vector-tensor and scalar-tensor theories and the non-relativistic perfect fluid. We express the second-order action of scalar perturbations in real space in terms of time- and scale-dependent dimensionless EFT parameters and derive the linear perturbation equations of motion by taking into account additional matter (baryons, radiation). In the small-scale limit, we obtain conditions for the absence of both ghosts and Laplacian instabilities and discuss how they are affected by the DE-DM interactions.

In Paper II of this series, we investigate the physical mechanisms governing envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase by systematically exploring the physically realizable configurations of stellar envelopes. We construct steady-state stellar envelope models by solving the time-independent stellar structure equations while neglecting the core. The inner boundary is defined by a fixed pressure condition motivated by MESA stellar evolution models presented in Paper I. Our models show three key features of envelope expansion toward the RG/RSG phase. (1) The refined mirror principle identified in Paper I is recovered: the post-main-sequence stellar radius varies inversely with the radius of the envelope's inner boundary, arising purely from hydrostatic equilibrium. (2) We identify an upper limit to envelope expansion corresponding to an effective temperature of $\sim 4000,{\rm K}$, characteristic of RG/RSG stars and consistent with the Hayashi limit. This temperature limit is regulated by H$^{-}$ opacity, whose sharp decline at low temperatures flattens the surface temperature gradient and drives a structural transition. (3) The yellow regime of intermediate radius corresponds to an instability zone, in which small displacements of the hydrogen-burning shell produce large variations in stellar radius, naturally accounting for the bifurcation of giants and supergiants into blue and red branches instead of remaining in the yellow regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19166" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-linear Dynamics and Primordial Black Hole Formation During Kination</a><span class="id">[2507.19166]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the effects of large scalar inhomogeneities during the kination epoch, a period in which the universe's dynamics are dominated by the kinetic energy of a scalar field, by fully evolving the Einstein equations using numerical relativity.

Hydrodynamical simulations are often used to constrain priors or calibrate models. Therefore, obtaining the maximum amount of information possible from these simulations is imperative. In this work, we have combined the information of shapes projected over two or three axes ($x,y,z$), for intrinsic alignment signals ($w_{g+},\ \tilde{\xi}_{g+,2}$), showing a consistent gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all cases studied using TNG300-1. The gain in SNR is found to be higher for the addition of the second projection than for the third, and higher for shapes calculated using the reduced inertia tensor rather than the simple one. The two shape samples studied, $n_\star&gt;300$ and $\mathrm{log}(M_\star \ h/\mathrm{M_\odot})&gt;10.5$, where the latter has a much higher signal amplitude, show similar gains in SNR when more projections are added. We also model the correlation functions with the non-linear alignment model. The SNR gains from the measurements are higher but consistent with the constraints on the non-linear alignment amplitude $A_{\rm IA}$ and galaxy bias $b_{\rm g}$. Using multiple projection axes increases SNR overall, enabling more efficient use of numerically expensive hydrodynamical simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From X-rays to High-Energy Gamma-rays: A Comprehensive Multi-Wavelength Study of Early Gamma-Ray Burst Afterglows</a><span class="id">[2510.05239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) generate powerful relativistic jets that inject a large amount of energy into their surrounding environment, producing blast waves that accelerate particles to high energies. The GRB afterglow radiation provides a powerful means to investigate the microphysics of relativistic shocks and to probe the medium surrounding the progenitor of the burst. In this study, we present a comprehensive multiwavelength analysis of 31 GRBs observed between 2008 and 2024 from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (X-ray Telescope and Burst Alert Telescope) and the Fermi Large Area Telescope, covering photon energies from 0.3 keV to 300 GeV. Our goal is to characterize the broadband spectral properties of GRB afterglows in soft X-rays, hard X-rays, and high-energy gamma rays. We investigate correlations between spectral shape and energy output across different parts of the spectrum. The observed emission is modeled using a forward shock scenario that includes both synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation losses. The results favor an SSC-dominated radiation model in a wind-like medium, consistent with expectations for long-duration GRBs. Crucially, this work provides new benchmarks for the microphysical parameters governing the emission, particularly indicating a notably low magnetic energy fraction, which refines previous estimates. By modeling broadband data, this study offers one of the most detailed SSC analyses in a wind-like environment to date. Notably, our results naturally account for the comparable energy output observed in both the soft X-ray and TeV bands, consistent with the previously detected TeV-GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18791" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beware of the running $n_s$ when producing heavy primordial black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.18791]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine single-field inflationary models for the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs).

This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA and the Einstein Telescope. However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter. To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of the models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to efficiently scan over the viable configurations.

Mock datasets are generated by considering the detector-specific selection functions, uncertainties in luminosity distance, and weak lensing systematics. We employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to constrain the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ cosmological parameters, AWGS bias parameters, and star formation rate (SFR) parameters under three detector configurations. Our results demonstrate that the joint observation can achieve sub-$5\%$ precision on $H_0$ ($2.19\%$) and $w$ ($5.7\%$). Besides, the AGWS clustering bias parameters can be constrained to the precision of $4\%-5\%$, enabling the differentiation between stellar-origin compact binaries and primordial black hole scenarios. This multi-messenger approach can also be helpful to resolve mass-redshift degeneracies in the dark siren methods, providing independent validation for the Hubble tension.

In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, they are expected to have undergone a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal masses, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to a stellar merger or a short-period binary. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. Using detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether non-conservative mass transfer, in which most of the mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from standard isotropic re-emission from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss geometry model reproduces the orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well over a wide range of initial conditions, offering a plausible formation pathway. We speculate this may point to enhanced eruptive mass loss, potentially driven by high-opacity subsurface layers in the donor prior to Roche-lobe overflow, consistent with preferentially bipolar outflows observed in luminous blue variables. Alternatively, it may indicate the need for more sophisticated mass-transfer prescriptions that account for highly unequal Roche-lobe sizes, sub-synchronous rotation, and possible self-accretion. Similar mechanisms may operate in other post-mass-transfer systems facing analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron-star and white-dwarf binaries, stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Multi-Wavelength Afterglow of Short Gamma-Ray Bursts with a Plateau Phase</a><span class="id">[2511.11396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibiting a plateau phase provide valuable insights into the post-merger activity of their central engines. Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray-only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Theory in Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.20739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}.

By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the intergalactic magnetic field from Fermi-LAT observations of GRB 221009A</a><span class="id">[2512.11128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A cosmological origin of the magnetic fields in large scale structures of the Universe would require a non-negligible magnetic field in cosmic voids, which, however, remains undetected.

The deflection of the pairs in the IGMF results in a time-delayed signal at GeV energies. Using observations with the Fermi Large Area Telescope of the GRB 221009A, we are able to derive the most stringent constraints to date from the non-observation of the cascade and rule out magnetic fields B &lt; 2.5 x 10^{-17} G at 95% confidence level for a coherence length larger than 1 Mpc.

The events are also accompanied by mass ejection from the neutron star. Fast radio bursts are short and intense pulses of coherent radio emission. Their large dispersion measures support an extragalactic origin. While their exact origin still remains elusive, a substantial number of models associates them with strong magnetic field and high-energy relativistic plasma found in the vicinity of magnetars. There is growing evidence that some fast radio bursts are associated with flare-type events from magnetars. We provide a set of configurations describing a relativistic, spherical, magnetic plasmoid explosion. We proceed by solving the equations of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics for a system that expands while maintaining its internal equilibrium. We find the interdependent relation between pressure, mass density, Lorentz factor, and magnetic field that determines the detailed properties of the solutions. A dichotomy of solutions exists that correspond to higher and lower density and thermal pressure compared to the external one. For stronger toroidal magnetic fields, the maximum permitted expansion velocity becomes lower than the weaker toroidal fields. These solution classes can be applied to magnetar giant flares and fast radio bursts. Those that corresponding to over densities and higher pressure can be associated with magnetar flares, and those corresponding to underdensities can be relevant to fast radio bursts that correspond to magnetically dominated events with low mass loading.

By combining \textit{TESS} photometry with an extensive set of times of maximum light spanning 39 years, we identify BE Lyn as a high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti star in a binary with an orbital period of $\approx15.9$ years and an extraordinary eccentricity of $e=0.9989^{+0.0008}_{-0.0021}$ ($&gt;0.9968$ at 95% confidence) – the most extreme eccentricity reliably measured for any binary system. Dynamical constraints limit the orbital inclination to $i \lesssim 10.1^{\circ}$, implying a companion mass $M_2 \gtrsim 2.5~M_{\odot}$, which spans the mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. If the companion is a neutron star, it would be the most massive known; if a black hole, it would be the closest to Earth. This system provides a unique laboratory for studying asteroseismology in strong gravitational fields, as well as the formation and evolution of extremely eccentric binaries. Our work demonstrates the use of the light-travel time effect in a pulsating star to reveal a compact companion, offering a novel method for detecting black holes in non-interacting binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33 b</a><span class="id">[2601.21072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of exoplanetary atmospheres provide critical insights into their chemical composition, formation and evolution history. Ultra-hot Jupiters serve as excellent targets for atmospheric characterization; studies of these planets may yield key understanding of gas giant's formation and evolution history. We present a thermal emission study of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere, based on two secondary eclipse observations with CFHT/WIRCam in two specific narrow band filters, namely the CO and CH4$_{\rm on}$ filters, and archival data with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer. Stellar pulsations of the host star induce some quasi-periodic photometric variations, particularly in the CH4$_{\rm on}$ band, which are modelled and corrected in the high-precision differential light curves. An eclipse depth of $1565.2^{+228.6}_{-237.5}$ ppm and $914.3^{+56.1}_{-57.0}$ ppm is determined for the CO and CH4$_{\rm on}$ bands, respectively. Combined with HST/WFC3 and Spitzer data, our joint retrieval of WASP-33 b's dayside atmosphere reveals a high metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 1.52^{+0.35}_{-0.52}$), high C/O ratio (C/O $= 0.78^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$), and a thermal inversion layer, suggesting a formation history involving metal-rich gas accretion. We confirm the presence of the molecules H$_{2}$O, H$^{-}$ and CO, and report a tentative detection of TiO in the dayside atmosphere of WASP-33 b.

We find that CPL inferences are strongly dataset-dependent. With CMB data alone, the broad geometric degeneracy in $(H_0,\Omega_{\rm m},w_0,w_a)$ admits an extrapolation tail that can extend to $q_0&lt;-1$ (super-acceleration), whereas adding DESI DR2 BAO pulls the reconstruction toward a weakly accelerating or nearly coasting present-day Universe ($q_0\simeq 0$). In contrast, combining CMB with PP&amp;SH0ES and BAOtr yields a conventional moderately accelerating expansion ($-1&lt;q_0\lesssim 0$) and substantially reduces the Hubble tension. Across all combinations, $w(z\to\infty)=w_0+w_a&lt;-1$, while at post-recombination redshifts the expansion remains matter dominated ($q\to1/2$). The origin of this behavior can be traced to low-redshift distance information: BAOtr and DESI prefer different BAO distance ratios at $z\lesssim 0.5$, which propagates into divergent expansion histories in CPL. In all cases, $r_{\rm d}$ stays nearly unchanged, indicating that shifts in $H_0$ arise from late-time expansion freedom rather than early-Universe physics. Bayesian evidence mirrors this contingency: it is strong for CPL mainly when PP&amp;SH0ES and/or BAOtr are included, while it is inconclusive for CMB-only and CMB+DESI and moderately favors $\Lambda$CDM for CMB+SDSS. Overall, our results show that the apparent support for CPL and its ability to ease the Hubble tension are not universal but depend sensitively on the adopted low-redshift distance data, motivating either more flexible late-time models or closer scrutiny of residual systematics in current BAO determinations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Status of the $S_8$ Tension: A 2026 Review of Probe Discrepancies</a><span class="id">[2602.12238]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The parameter $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ quantifies the amplitude of matter density fluctuations.

This review assesses the “$S_8$ tension” against a new 2026 baseline: a unified “Combined CMB” framework incorporating Planck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G. This combined analysis yields $S_8 = 0.836^{+0.012}_{-0.013}$, providing a higher central value and reduced uncertainties compared to Planck alone. Compiling measurements from 2019–2026, we reveal a striking bifurcation: DES Year 6 results exhibit a statistically significant tension of $2.4\sigma$–$2.7\sigma$ in $S_8$ \citep{DESY6}, whereas KiDS Legacy results demonstrate statistical consistency at $&lt;1\sigma$ \citep{Wright2025}. We examine systematic origins of this dichotomy, including photometric redshift calibration, intrinsic alignment modeling, and shear measurement pipelines. We further contextualize these findings with cluster counts (where eROSITA favors high values while SPT favors low), galaxy-galaxy lensing, and redshift-space distortions. The heterogeneous landscape suggests survey-specific systematic effects contribute substantially to observed discrepancies, though new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM cannot be excluded.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Nonlinear Quenching Effects on Polar Field Buildup in the Sun Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2602.16656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $\Delta D_{\mathrm{LQ}}/\Delta D_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave-Induced Freeze-In of Fermionic Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2405.09723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The minimal coupling of massless fermions to gravity does not allow for their gravitational production solely based on the expansion of the Universe.

Our numerical results demonstrate that Krylov complexity grows exponentially during inflation, indicating chaotic behavior, before saturating at nearly constant values in the RD and MD eras due to particle production via preheating. Furthermore, we analyze the Krylov entropy, which exhibits an evolutionary trend analogous to that of complexity.

These DM candidates are typically said to behave &quot;classically&quot;. More specifically, they are often assumed to reside in an ensemble of coherent states. One notable exception to this scenario is when isocurvature fluctuations of the DM are produced during inflation (or more generally by any Bogoliubov transformation). In such contexts, the ultralight DM instead resides in a squeezed state. In this work, we demonstrate that these two scenarios can be distinguished via the statistics of the DM density fluctuations, such as the matter power spectrum and bispectrum. This provides a probe of the DM state which persists in the limit of large particle number and does not rely on any non-gravitational interactions of the DM. Importantly, the statistics of these two states differ when the modes of the squeezed state are all in-phase, as is the case at the end of inflation. Later cosmological dynamics may affect this configuration. Our work motivates future numerical studies of how cosmological dynamics may impact the initial squeezed state and the statistics of its density fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Open System Approach to Gravity</a><span class="id">[2507.03103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several major open problems in cosmology, including the nature of inflation, dark matter, and dark energy, share a common structure: they involve spacetime-filling media with unknown microphysics, and can be probed so far only through their gravitational effects. This observation motivates a systematic open-system approach to cosmology, in which gravity evolves in the presence of a generic, unobservable environment. In this work, we develop a general framework for open gravitational dynamics based on general relativity and the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, carefully addressing the nontrivial constraints imposed by diffeomorphism invariance. At the quantum level, our path integral formulation computes the gravitational density matrix in perturbation theory around a semi-classical spacetime. As illustrative applications, we study inflation and the propagation of gravitational waves in classical regimes where environmental interactions are non-negligible. In the inflationary context, our framework reproduces the known Open Effective Field Theory of Inflation in the decoupling limit and extends it to include gravitational interactions. For gravitational waves, we derive the most general conservative and dissipative corrections to propagation. Remarkably, we find that the leading-order gravitational birefringence is dissipative in nature, whereas conservative birefringence appears only at higher derivative order, opposite to the electromagnetic case. Our results pave the way to modeling dissipative effects in the late universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From $U(1) \times U(1)$ Symmetry Breaking to Majoron Cosmology: Insights from NANOGrav 15-year Data</a><span class="id">[2507.04342]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the cosmology of a modified majoron model motivated by the need to protect a global $U(1)$ symmetry from gravity-induced hard explicit breaking (by $d \leq 4$ operators) at the Planck scale. The model extends the Standard Model by introducing a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ and an approximate global $U(1)$ symmetry, each spontaneously broken by a corresponding complex scalar singlet. This setup gives rise to a network of effectively global and local cosmic strings, whose stochastic gravitational wave signals can jointly account for the spectrum observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, particularly for majoron masses $m_{\chi} &lt; 10^{-23}$ eV. Although the fit is not as strong as that from supermassive black hole mergers, the model still provides an alternative explanation rooted in high-energy physics. The model also generates light neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism and avoids cosmological constraints from $\Delta N_{\text{eff}}$, CMB anisotropies, and isocurvature fluctuations. Although the majoron can contribute to dark matter through thermal, coherent oscillation, and string-induced production mechanisms, its relic abundance remains subdominant in the NANOGrav-compatible region. In contrast, the measured dark matter relic density is achievable at higher $m_\chi$, though at the cost of tension with cosmological bounds. If the NANOGrav fits are viewed as constraints, given their comparatively lower Bayes factors, they yield bounds that are significantly stronger than those imposed by the CMB and other cosmological data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinguishing gravity theories with networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors</a><span class="id">[2507.09543]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a method for separating and detecting the non-tensor modes of stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) using networks of space-based gravitational-wave detectors.

The $Z_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion model reduces the QCD axion mass naturally, by invoking a discrete $Z_\mathcal{N}$ symmetry through which the axion field is coupled to $\mathcal{N}$ copies of the Standard Model. Before the QCD phase transition at temperature $T_{\rm QCD}$, the $Z_\mathcal{N}$ potential has a minimum at misalignment angle $\theta=\pi$. At $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta =\pi$ becomes a maximum; the axion potential becomes exponentially suppressed and develops $\mathcal{N}$ minima – only one of which actually solves the strong CP problem. Before $T_{\rm QCD}$, $\theta$ relaxes towards $\pi$. After $T_{\rm QCD}$, the axion field starts from around the hilltop and may have sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the newly suppressed potential barriers. Such a field evolution leads to nonlinear effects via the self-interactions near the hilltop, which can cause the exponential growth of fluctuations and backreaction on the coherent motion. This behavior can influence the relic density of the field and the minimum in which it settles. We conduct the first lattice simulations of the $Z_{\mathcal{N}}$ QCD axion using ${\mathcal C}$osmo${\mathcal L}$attice to accurately calculate dark matter abundances and find nonlinear dynamics reduce the abundance by up to a factor of two.

This field is not associated with an ExB drift because it is observed in the plasma rest frame. Instead, it is balanced by the Generalized Ohm's Law terms whose current dependent term associated with this electric field was less than 1 milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. The region also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the Generalized Ohm's Law could be significant. In addition, both the density and electric field had non-zero slopes as functions of time, suggesting that the pressure gradient term in the Generalized Ohm's Law also mattered. This large electric field in the plasma rest frame may be the first and largest such field ever reported.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ Gravity Compatible with ACT</a><span class="id">[2601.07879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We confront the ghost-free non-local $F(R)$ gravity theories with the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) constraints on the spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the updated constraints of Planck/BICEP on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. After reviewing how the ghost-free non-local version of $F(R)$ gravity can be obtained, we show that the de Sitter solution can be obtained in this framework. Also, we show that the resulting theory can be cast in terms of an $F(R,\phi)$ theory of gravity. We analyze two models of non-local $F(R)$ gravity, one power-law and the $R^2$ model, and we show that both models can be compatible with the ACT and updated Planck/BICEP constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino production mechanisms in strongly magnetized quark matter: Current status and open questions</a><span class="id">[2601.14450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review the main neutrino emission mechanisms operating in dense quark matter under strong magnetic fields, with particular emphasis on conditions expected in the interiors of compact stars. We discuss the direct Urca and neutrino synchrotron processes in unpaired quark matter, incorporating the effects of Landau-level quantization. For the direct Urca process, the quantization of the electron energy spectrum plays a critical role, whereas quark quantization can often be neglected at sufficiently high baryon densities. The resulting field-dependent neutrino emissivity is anisotropic and exhibits an oscillatory behavior as a function of magnetic-field strength. We explore the implications of these effects for magnetar cooling and for possible anisotropic neutrino emission that could contribute to pulsar kicks. In addition, we review the $\nu\bar{\nu}$ synchrotron emission process, which, although subdominant, provides valuable insights into the interplay between magnetic fields and weak interactions in dense quark matter. Overall, our analysis highlights the nontrivial influence of strong magnetic fields on neutrino production in magnetized quark cores, with potential consequences for the thermal and dynamical evolution of compact stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When inflationary perturbations refuse to classicalise: the role of non-Gaussianity in Wigner negativity</a><span class="id">[2601.22219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inflationary perturbations are quantum in origin. Yet, when computing cosmological observables, they are often treated as classical stochastic fields. Do they nevertheless retain quantum birthmarks? A hallmark of genuinely quantum behaviour is quantum interferences, arising from phase coherence between distinct branches of the wavefunction. Such interference is diagnosed by the non-positivity of the Wigner function, and according to Hudson's theorem, the only pure states with positive Wigner functions are Gaussian states. Consequently, any departure from Gaussianity necessarily implies a non-positive Wigner function, precluding a description in terms of a classical distribution. This motivates us to compute the Wigner function of curvature perturbations, accounting for primordial non-Gaussianities, using the EFT of inflation. We find that the Wigner function develops pronounced interference fringes on super-Hubble scales, and in particular, its negativity grows as $a^2$ in ultra-slow-roll backgrounds. These results demonstrate that quantum effects can remain significant at late times, and that squeezing alone does not ensure classicality, contrary to standard lore. This suggests that the prospects for detecting genuinely quantum signatures of the universe's origins in cosmological observables may be less bleak than previously thought.</p></div></details></article></body>
