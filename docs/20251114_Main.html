Implications for measurements of rotation and internal magnetic fields</a><span class="id">[2511.09617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asymmetries in the observed rotational splittings of a multiplet contain information about the star's rotation profile and internal magnetic field. However, to exploit this information, highly accurate theoretical predictions are needed. We aim to quantify the difference in the predicted mode asymmetries between a 1D perturbative method, and a 2D method that includes a 2D stellar structure model, which takes rotation into account. We then put these differences in the context of asteroseismic measurements of internal magnetic fields. We couple the 1D pulsation codes GYRE and StORM to the 2D stellar structure code ESTER and compare the oscillation predictions with the results from the 2D TOP pulsation code. We focus on ZAMS models representative of rotating $\beta$ Cephei pulsators, going up to 20% of the critical rotation rate. We find a generally good agreement between the oscillation frequencies resulting from the 1D and 2D pulsation codes. Since the magnetic asymmetries are small compared to the differences in the rotational asymmetries resulting from the 1D and 2D predictions, accurate measurements of the magnetic field are in most cases challenging. Differences in the predicted mode asymmetries between 1D perturbative methods and 2D non-perturbative methods can greatly hinder accurate measurements of internal magnetic fields in main-sequence pulsators with low-order modes. Nevertheless, reasonably accurate measurements could be possible with $n_{pg} \ge 2$ modes if the internal rotation is roughly below 10% of the critical rotation frequency for (aligned) magnetic fields on the order of a few hundred kG. While the differences between the 1D and 2D predictions are mostly too large for internal magnetic field detections, the rotational asymmetries predicted by StORM are in general accurate enough for asteroseismic modelling of the stellar rotation in main-sequence stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Changing-Look AGN Powered By Disk Tearing</a><span class="id">[2511.09626]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Changing-look active galactic nuclei (CLAGN) feature order-of-magnitude variability in both the continuum and broad line luminosities on months-to-years long timescales, and are currently unexplained. Simulations have demonstrated that rotating black holes sometimes tear apart tilted accretion disks. These tearing events violently restructure the disk on timescales much shorter than a viscous timescale, hinting at a connection to CLAGN. Here, we show that disk tearing can power changing-look events. We report synthetic observations of an extremely high resolution three-dimensional general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a geometrically thin, tilted accretion disk around a rapidly rotating, $10^8\,M_\odot$ black hole. We perform ray-tracing calculations that follow the disk light to both a line of sight camera and to a distribution of cameras in a prescribed torus-like broad line region. The continuum photoionizes the broad line region and we calculate the resulting spectrum. Both the continuum and line luminosities undergo order of magnitude swings on months-to-years long timescales. We find shorter, weeks long variability driven by the geometric precession of the inner disk and an intraday quasi-periodic oscillation driven by radial breathing of the inner disk. When the torn disk precesses, it causes asymmetric illumination of the broad line region, driving time-evolving red-to-blue asymmetries of the broad emission lines that may be a smoking gun for disk tearing. We also make predictions for future photometric observations from ULTRASAT and Vera Rubin Observatory, both of which may play an important role in detecting future changing-look events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I. Resonant Conversions in Halos</a><span class="id">[2511.09630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mixing between dark photons and visible photons leads to substantial anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background due to resonant conversions of visible photons into dark photons in baryonic matter found in dark matter halos. In this Letter, we forecast the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to this signal. We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $\epsilon$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prebiotic Chemistry Insights for Dragonfly: Thermodynamics of Amino Acid Synthesis in Selk Crater on Titan</a><span class="id">[2511.09636]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Saturnian moon Titan presents a compelling testbed for probing prebiotic chemistry beyond early Earth. Impact-generated melt pools provide transient aqueous habitats in an otherwise cryogenic environment. We use Cantera equilibrium models to assess whether mixtures of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), and ammonia (NH3) can drive amino acid synthesis in Selk-sized craters. Across twenty-one amino acids (twenty proteinogenic plus beta-alanine), NH3-free systems yield only proline, alanine, and beta-alanine, whereas adding as little as 1% NH3 (relative to H2O) renders almost the full suite accessible, with yields peaking at 2% and tapering thereafter. The NH3-free alanine result implies alternative pathways beyond classical Strecker or aminonitrile hydrolysis, suggesting acetylene, abundant on Titan but scarce on early Earth, as a plausible feedstock. We identify acrylonitrile (detected on Titan) as a thermodynamically favorable intermediate that can convert to alanine under aqueous conditions in an NH3-free pathway. For glycine and alanine production from nitrile hydrolysis, comparison with laboratory kinetics shows that our equilibrium models predict near-complete conversion, while observed rates yield only partial products over weeks. Yet estimated chemical equilibration times (years-centuries) are far shorter than melt lifetimes, supporting plausibility of equilibrium in situ. These predictions are directly testable with Dragonfly mass spectrometer (DraMS), for which we recommend pre-flight standards to test proline, alanine, beta-alanine, cysteine, and methionine. The first three offer the best chances for amino acid detection regardless of ammonia availability; the latter two offer diagnostic tools for determining the presence of reactive sulfur in post-impact Titan ponds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: II.

Through a kinetic mixing term, visible photons from the cosmic microwave background can resonantly convert into dark photons, generating new temperature anisotropies in the sky. In this work, we detail the entire analysis pipeline that we use to compute SKA's sensitivity, focusing on resonant conversions that occur in the intergalactic medium. We also discuss the sensitivity of 21-cm experiments to dark photons. Our results show that both SKA in combination with galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments could discover dark photons with masses between $5\times 10^{-15}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV, and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as low as $10^{-8}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the Dark Matter Self-Interaction Cross-Section with Deep Compact Clustering for Robust Machine Learning Inference</a><span class="id">[2511.09660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have developed a machine learning algorithm capable of detecting “out-of-domain data” for trustworthy cosmological inference. By using data from two separate suites of cosmological simulations, we show that our algorithm is able to determine whether “observed” data is consistent with its training domain, returning confidence estimates as well as accurate parameter estimations. We apply our algorithm to two-dimensional images of galaxy clusters from the BAHAMAS-SIDM and DARKSKIES simulations with the aim to measure the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter. Through deep compact clustering we construct an informative latent space where galaxy clusters are mapped to the latent space forming “latent-clusters” for each simulation, with the location of the latent-cluster corresponding to the macroscopic parameters, such as the cross-section, $\sigma_{\rm DM}/m$. We then pass through mock observations, where the location of the observed latent-cluster informs us of which properties are shared with the training data. If the observed latent-cluster shares no similarities with latent-clusters from the known simulations, we can conclude that our simulations do not represent the observations and discard any parameter estimations, thus providing us with a method to measure machine learning confidence. This method serves as a blueprint for transparent and robust inference that is in demand in scientific machine learning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">glitterin: Towards Replacing the Role of Lorenz-Mie Theory in Astronomy Using Neural Networks Trained on Light Scattering of Irregularly Shaped Grains</a><span class="id">[2511.09668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Light scattering by dust particles is often modeled assuming the dust is spherical for numerical simplicity and speed. However, real dust particles have highly irregular morphologies that significantly affect their scattering properties. We have developed glitterin, a neural network trained to predict light scattering from irregularly shaped dust grains, offering a computationally efficient alternative to Lorenz-Mie theory. We computed scattering properties using the Discrete Dipole Approximation code ADDA for irregularly shaped particles across size parameters x from 0.1 to 65, covering a range in complex refractive index m that includes astrosilicates, pyroxene, enstatite, water-ice, etc. The neural network operates at millisecond timescales while maintaining superior accuracy compared to linear interpolation. Irregular grains exhibit x-dependent deviations from spherical predictions. At small x, cross-sections approach volume-equivalent spheres for low m. At large x, irregular grains show enhanced cross-sections due to greater geometric extension. Increasing m also enhances the absorption cross-section relative to the volume-equivalent spheres. This differential x and m dependence creates mid-IR solid-state features distinct from predictions from spherical grains. Validation against laboratory measurements of forsterite and hematite demonstrates that our neural network captures both qualitative and quantitative behaviors more accurately than spherical models. Millimeter-wavelength applications reveal that spherical grains produce opposite polarization signatures compared to irregular grains, potentially relaxing stringent  100um grain size constraints in protoplanetary disks. glitterin is publicly available and alleviates the computational barriers to incorporating emission and scattering of realistic grain morphologies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a Machine Learning Solution for Hubble Tension: Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) Analysis of Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy in Presence of Neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2511.09706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework for reconstructing the redshift-dependent Hubble parameter \(H(z)\) within the Tsallis Holographic Dark Energy (THDE) model extended by massive neutrinos. In this approach, the modified Friedmann equation is incorporated into the neural network loss function, enabling training on Cosmic Chronometers data up to \(z \leq 2\). The framework allows for the simultaneous estimation of the Hubble constant \(H_0\), the neutrino density parameter \(\Omega_\nu\), and the Tsallis non-extensivity index \(\delta\). Uncertainty quantification is performed through dropout simulations, resulting in statistically consistent \(1\sigma\) confidence bands. Our results show that the THDE+$\nu$ model, reconstructed via PINN, alleviates the statistical Hubble tension from the canonical \(\sim 5\sigma\) level down to a range of \(0.5\sigma \leq T \leq 2.2\sigma\), depending on the redshift sampling. Additionally, we constrain the total neutrino mass to \(\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.11\,\text{eV}\). A detailed comparison with the traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis demonstrates the consistency of both methods, while highlighting the competitiveness of the PINN-based THDE framework as a robust, data-driven approach for non-parametric cosmological inference within generalized thermodynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PEPSI Investigation, Retrieval, and Atlas of Numerous Giant Atmospheres (PIRANGA). IV. High-Resolution Phased-Resolved Spectroscopy of The Ultra Hot Jupiter KELT-20 b</a><span class="id">[2511.09720]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present five datasets of high-resolution optical emission spectra of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20 b with the PEPSI spectrograph. Using a Bayesian retrieval framework, we constrain its dayside pressure-temperature profile and abundances of Fe, Ni, and Ca, providing the first measurements for Ni and Ca for KELT-20 b in emission. We retrieve the pre- and post-eclipse datasets separately (corresponding to the evening and morning sides, respectively), and compare the constraints on their thermal structures and chemical abundances. We constrain lower abundances in the pre-eclipse datasets compared to the post-eclipse datasets. We interpret these results with an equilibrium chemistry model which suggests  10-30x supersolar refractory abundances. Due to the well-known degeneracy between absolute abundances and continuum opacities, the abundance ratios are more precise probes of the planetary abundances. Therefore we measure the abundance ratios [Ni/Fe] and [Ca/Fe] across these datasets and find they agree within 1-sigma. We constrain [Ni/Fe] to be consistent with solar within 2-sigma, and [Ca/Fe] to be 0.001-0.01x solar, not accounting for ionization. We compare these abundance ratios with literature results for KELT-20 b in transmission, and find they agree within 2-sigma, suggesting that even though the abundances vary significantly as a function of phase, the abundance ratios of these species remain relatively constant. We find a  100 K difference in temperature at the top of the thermal inversion, suggesting a hotter evening side than morning side and underscoring the importance of considering 3D effects when studying ultra-hot Jupiters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seasonal and Diurnal Variability of Atmospheric Pressure in Jezero Crater, Mars, from MEDA Measurements on the Perseverance Rover</a><span class="id">[2511.09743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of atmospheric pressure variability inside Jezero Crater on Mars based on measurements from the MEDA meteorological station aboard NASA's Perseverance rover. Pressure data from Sols 182, 361, 504, and 658 reveal seasonal and diurnal fluctuations linked to solar insolation, CO2 condensation and sublimation cycles, and local geomorphology. During Sol 504, an unexpected pressure increase was recorded despite coinciding with the onset of northern winter, suggesting the influence of perihelion and dust-related thermal tides. Statistical parameters such as mean, standard deviation, and amplitude show that Jezero exhibits larger diurnal pressure swings than Gale Crater, mainly due to its lower latitude and topographic confinement. These results demonstrate the strong coupling between Martian atmospheric dynamics, orbital configuration, and local topography, and illustrate the value of MEDA data for characterizing short-term and seasonal variations in the Martian boundary layer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Long-Period Radio Transients in ASKAP EMU Data with 10-Second Imaging</a><span class="id">[2511.09770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a recently identified phenomenon that challenge our current understanding of compact objects and coherent radio emission mechanisms. These objects emit radio pulses similar to those of pulsars, but at much longer periods – on the order of minutes to hours. With duty cycles of only a few percent, individual pulses have been observed to last between 10 and 1000 seconds. This places LPTs in a timescale gap between the two main techniques used in transient radio searches: time-series analysis at millisecond to second timescales, and image-plane searches sensitive to variability on the scale of days. As a result, LPTs remained undetected until recently, and only a handful are currently known. To increase the sample of known LPTs, we conducted a dedicated search using 200 hours of archival data from the ASKAP Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, covering 750 deg$^2$ of sky at the shortest possible imaging time step of 10-seconds. This represents the first large-scale search using ASKAP data at second-scale resolution. Although no LPTs were detected, we identified flares from six stars, at least one had never been detected in the radio regime before. We placed a lower limit on the transient surface density of $2.21\times10^{-6}$ deg$^{-2}$ at a 10-second timescale, with a sensitivity of 16.9 mJy. Our findings evaluate the feasibility of detecting radio transients using 10-second imaging with ASKAP and provide insights into improving detection pipelines and observation strategies for LPTs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating the Diffuse Neutrino Emission from the Milky Way with GALPROP</a><span class="id">[2511.09777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the GALPROP cosmic ray (CR) propagation framework to model the diffuse neutrino and gamma-ray emissions from the Galaxy.

We find that all the GALPROP models are consistent with the neutrino data within uncertainties. They are also consistent with expectations of neutrino emissions derived from LHAASO data when accounting for possible gamma-ray point source contamination.

In this paper, we develop a new model to estimate the contact surface radius and the number of contact points as functions of collision velocity, and examine the formation process of comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Our model is based on the compressive strength of dust aggregates obtained from numerical simulations and assumes that all the impact energy of the pebbles is used for their mutual compression. We compare our model with numerical simulations of pebble collisions, in which we prepare the initial pebbles in the form of compressed dust aggregate spheres and measure the contact surface and pebble radii using two- and three-dimensional characteristic radii, respectively. We also apply our model to the formation scenario of comet 67P, whose tensile strength and bulk density have already been estimated in the literature. We find that its low tensile strength points to formation via pebble collisions at velocities below $\sim10\mathrm{\ cm\ s^{-1}}$ when a microscopic filling factor of pebbles is lower than 0.6, suggesting that inelastic bouncing collisions played a role in damping the collision velocities. By assuming that the pebble collision velocity is determined by the transition velocity between bouncing and sticking, we estimate the pebble radius inside comet 67P to be 130 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ or smaller.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A precessing magnetic jet as the engine of GRB 250702B</a><span class="id">[2511.09850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250702B shows ultra long, episodic prompt activity, with three hard gamma ray episodes over about 3.2 h with quasi regular spacing P   2825 s, preceded by a soft X ray flare about one day earlier. We interpret these phenomena with a unified scenario in which a stellar mass black hole accretes from a massive, misaligned debris disk and launches a magnetically dominated, precessing, structured (spine sheath) jet. The engine clock arises from Lense Thirring precession of the outer annulus of a geometrically thick inner torus at radius r   250 to 300 gravitational radii, while the hard spectra reflect magnetic reconnection dissipation in the spine. A slightly off axis viewing geometry resolves the apparent opening angle tension without invoking late energy injection. &quot;Missing&quot; pulses in the second and third cycles occur naturally when low amplitude nutation causes the beaming cone to miss the line of sight.

In order to study the scale-dependent clustering of massive neutrinos, we develop a fast linear response method, FAST-nu f, applicable to neutrinos and other non-relativistic hot dark matter. Using it as an accurate linear approximation to help us reduce the dynamic range of emulator training data, based upon a non-linear perturbation theory for massive neutrinos, we improve the emulator's accuracy at small M_nu and length scales by a factor of two. We significantly sharpen its momentum resolution for the slowest neutrinos, which, despite their small mass fraction, dominate small-scale clustering. Furthermore, we extend the emulator from the degenerate to the normal and inverted mass orderings. Applying this new emulator, Cosmic-Enu-II, to large halos in N-body simulations, we show that non-linear perturbation theory can reproduce the neutrino density profile in the halo outskirts, 2R_vir &lt; r &lt; 10R_vir , to better than 10%.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composite Dissipation in Warm Inflation: Implications for the Primordial Power Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2511.10024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Warm inflation is a well-motivated and generalized framework of inflation, describing a coupled inflaton-radiation bath. In this work, we investigate a warm inflation model with a quartic potential and a composite dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon(\phi, T) = C_1 \frac{T^3}{M_{\text{Pl}}^2} + C_2 \frac{T^3}{\phi^2}.$ The two terms in $\Upsilon$ dominate at different scales: the first term governs the early inflationary dynamics at large (CMB) scales, while the second term becomes significant at smaller scales. The model features two distinct stages of inflation: an initial phase where strong dissipation ($Q \gg 1$) generates a red-tilted primordial spectrum consistent with CMB observations (from ACT), followed by a second phase producing a blue-tilted spectrum with a significant amplification of power at small scales, leading to primordial black hole formation. We analyze the effects of key parameters – like the duration of each inflationary phase, the slow-roll parameter at the end of the first phase, the dissipation strength at the pivot scale, and the choice of the growth function – on the primordial power spectrum and its spectral index. Additionally, we examine the consistency of the model with the swampland distance conjecture and trans-Planckian conjecture, needed for embedding these models with some UV complete theories. This work highlights the potential of warm inflation with a composite dissipation coefficient to reconcile large-scale CMB measurements with small-scale structure formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchrotron radiation from NGC 470 HLX1 - a hidden hyperluminous accreting neutron star?</a><span class="id">[2511.10183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first broadband spectral analysis of NGC 470 HLX1, a hyperluminous X-ray source that exhibits significant flux variability over different epochs.

Furthermore, if the barycenter of the pair follows an eccentric orbit around an AGN, then space-borne gravitational wave detectors can measure the density of the surrounding disk with multi-year observations by tracking the gravitational wave evolution.

These two parameters are routinely measured and are used to categorise different populations of observed exoplanets. They are also tightly linked to the planet's properties, in particular those of the interior. As such they offer the unique opportunity to interpret the observations and potentially infer the planet's chemistry and structure. Required for the interpretation are models of planetary interiors, calculated a priori, constrained using other available data, and based on the physiochemical properties of mineralogical phases. This article offers an overview of the current knowledge about exoplanet interiors, the fundamental aspects and tools for interior modelling and how to improve the contraints on the models, along with a discussion on the sources of uncertainty. The origin and fate of volatiles, and their role in planetary evolution is discussed. The chemistry and structure of planetary interiors have a pivotal role in the thermal evolution of planets and the development of large scale properties that might become observables with future space missions and ground-based surveys. As such, having reliable and well constrained interior models is of the utmost importance for the advancement of the field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">True spin-orbit obliquities distribution: data-driven confirmation of no clustering of misaligned planets</a><span class="id">[2511.10313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. True spin-orbit obliquities {\Psi} offer valuable insights into the evolutionary history of exoplanetary systems. Previous studies have suggested that exoplanets tend to occupy either aligned or perpendicular orbits. However, recent research has indicated potential biases caused by the low sample, questioning whether this dichotomy would persist with a larger dataset. Simultaneously, a similar dichotomous behavior has been suggested for Neptune-sized planets. Aims. We aim to investigate the distribution of true spin-orbit obliquities {\Psi} with an enlarged sample, looking for confirmation of the disputed dichotomy previously found, with a focus also on the obliquities of Neptunes. Methods. Starting from a sample of 264 projected obliquities {\lambda}, we homogeneously compute true obliquities {\Psi} for 116 planets using the rotation period method. We combine them with 4 further values gathered from literature and we then study their distribution, also as a function of various star-planet system parameters. Results. Our data-driven work based on 120 true obliquities {\Psi} - the largest sample to date - strongly confirms the presence of a single cluster of aligned planets, followed by an isotropic distribution of misaligned planets with no preferred misalignment. This result is based on a uniform distribution of stellar inclinations {i_\star} , for which non-uniformity could have biased previous interpretations of the arrangement of true obliquities. We confirm that Neptunians show a tentative dichotomous distribution with data available today, but its veracity needs confirmation with an enlarged sample, also because an anisotropic distribution of stellar inclination may be one of the factors hindering the real distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Dynamical Scalar Field Model for Dark Energy: Addressing the Hubble Tension and Cosmic Evolution</a><span class="id">[2511.10317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a dynamical dark energy model based on a canonical scalar field with a hybrid potential of the form $V(\phi) = V_{0}e^{-\lambda\phi} + V_{1}\phi^{n}$. We constrain the model's 11-dimensional parameter space using a comprehensive combination of cosmological data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) power spectra, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), the Pantheon+ supernova sample, and the matter power spectrum from SDSS. The model provides an excellent fit to the data, with a reduced chi-squared of $\chi^2_{\text{red}} = 0.987$, while successfully alleviating the Hubble constant tension. Our analysis yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = 70.0$ km/s/Mpc, reducing the discrepancy between early and late-universe measurements. The data favor a negative power-law index of $n \approx -0.92$. A model comparison using the Bayesian Information Criterion finds that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is still slightly preferred ($\Delta\text{BIC} = 2.178$) due to its fewer parameters. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that this hybrid potential model is a compelling, physically motivated alternative to a cosmological constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alfven Waves in Partially Ionised Solar Steady-State Plasmas</a><span class="id">[2511.10330]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our study investigates the properties of Alfvén waves in partially ionised solar plasmas in the presence of steady, field-aligned, flows of charged and neutral particles.

Using a combination of analytical dispersion analysis and numerical solutions, we examine the impact of these flows on the behaviour of Alfvén waves. Our results show that steady flows lead to substantial modifications of wave properties, including Doppler shifts, propagation direction reversal, flow-dependent changes in damping rates, and the appearance of a new mode associated with neutral flow and collisional coupling.

The mission ended after 36 h due to a balloon leak that resulted in the payload being lost in the Pacific Ocean. Over the course of the mission, the onboard Cherenkov Telescope (CT) was pointed just below the Earth's limb to search for optical signals from upward-moving extensive air showers that were induced by decaying tau-leptons that were generated by the conversion of $&gt;10$ PeV tau-neutrinos in Earth. Such very-high energy (VHE) neutrinos may be produced in several classes of astrophysical sources that are suspected of possibly accelerating particles to ultra-high energies. In this contribution, we discuss the EUSO-SPB2 Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) campaign to search for VHE neutrino signals coming from astrophysical sources that crossed the CT's field of view ($6.4^\circ \times 12.8^\circ$). We also present a new software tool designed for scheduling observations, the Neutrino Target Scheduler, that we developed to support the ToO campaign. We also calculate upper limits on the neutrino fluences from sources observed during the ToO campaign. Our observations demonstrate the viability of conducting ToO follow-up observations from a near space environment with future balloon missions, such as the pathfinder mission POEMMA-Balloon with Radio.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk warping and black hole X-ray binaries I. Tentative unification of low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations</a><span class="id">[2511.10474]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray binaries exhibit complex variability patterns studied in the power-spectrum. These include the broad-band noise (BBN) components and various types of narrow components called quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). There is currently no consensus about either what determines the presence/absence of the BBN or what generates the QPOs. Many believe the latter is due to frame-dragging effects caused by Lense-Thirring torques. We wish to investigate the potential impact of those frame-dragging effects on the accretion disk itself. In particular, we focus on its impact on the observed variability and the presence (and types) of QPOs associated. We make analytical estimates to assess the potential presence of a geometric warp in the inner accretion disk during state transitions. We show that the presence of a warp can modify the spectral-timing properties in a way that matches the observed transition between QPO types during outbursts. We also discuss the peculiar case of Cyg X-1, as well as how the hard-to-soft transition could be driven by the warp itself. The (expected) emergence of a warp provides a consistent explanation for the evolution of both the BBN and the QPO properties during state transitions. This offers a first path toward unifying the variability of black hole X-ray binary.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collisional and magnetic effects on the polarization of the solar oxygen infrared triplet</a><span class="id">[2511.10476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: The scattering polarization of the infrared (IR) triplet of neutral oxygen (O \textsc{i}) near 777 nm provides a powerful diagnostic of solar atmospheric conditions. However, interpreting such polarization requires a rigorous treatment of isotropic depolarizing collisions between O \textsc{i} atoms and neutral hydrogen. Aims: We aim to investigate the combined effects of collisional and magnetic depolarization in shaping the alignment of O \textsc{i} levels (and thus the polarization of the O \textsc{i} IR triplet). Methods: We compute, for the first time, a comprehensive set of collisional depolarization and polarization transfer rates for the relevant O \textsc{i} energy levels. These rates are incorporated into a multi-level atomic model, and the statistical equilibrium equations (SEE) are solved to quantify the impact of collisions and magnetic fields on atomic alignment. Results: Our calculations indicate that elastic collisions with neutral hydrogen, together with the Hanle effect of turbulent magnetic fields stronger than about 20 G, efficiently suppress the bulk of the atomic alignment in deep photospheric conditions where hydrogen densities exceed $n_{\mathrm{H}} \sim 10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$. In the chromosphere, however, the lower hydrogen density weakens collisional depolarization, allowing polarization to persist. Conclusions: Our results are consistent with a chromospheric origin for the linear polarization signals of the O I IR triplet. Future studies should combine accurate non-LTE radiative transfer with reliable collisional rates in order to achieve fully consistent modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Les Trente Glorieuses: 29 years of helioseismic observations with the Luminosity Oscillations Imager</a><span class="id">[2511.10491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Luminosity Oscillations Imager (LOI) of the Variability of Solar Irradiance and Gravity Oscillations (VIRGO) instrument aboard the SoHO mission has been operating for almost the past 30 years.

This millisecond pulsar is a primary science target for the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer telescope (NICER, which discovered its X-ray pulsations), has accumulated near-continuous $\gamma$-ray data since the Fermi-Large Area Telescope's launch, and has been studied extensively with the Green Bank and Nançay radio telescopes. We have undertaken a campaign with the Green Bank Telescope targeting specific orbital phases designed to improve our constraint on the pulsar's mass through the detection of a relativistic Shapiro delay. Both frequentist and Bayesian techniques – the latter incorporating priors from white dwarf binary evolution models – are applied to fifteen years of radio observations, yielding relatively weak constraints on the companion and pulsar masses of $0.23^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $1.87^{+1.11}_{-0.67}$ M$_{\odot}$, respectively (68.3% CI from Bayesian fits); however, the orbital inclination is measured to better relative precision ($79.80^{+3.47}_{-4.70}$ degrees). Restricting the maximum allowed pulsar mass to 3 M$_{\odot}$ while simultaneously sampling the noise and timing models improves the constraint and lowers the measured mass to $1.62^{+0.73}_{-0.58}$ M$_{\odot}$. While our radio-derived inclination result has informed recent NICER X-ray studies of PSR J1231$-$1411, the lessons learned from this troublesome pulsar will also bolster future high-precision mass measurement campaigns and resulting constraints on the neutron star interior equation of state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10537" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the nature of the most extreme Galactic particle accelerator.

LHAASO observations revealed V4641 Sgr as the most extreme example so far. Using $\approx$100 h of H.E.S.S. data, we performed a spectro-morphological study of the gamma-ray emission around V4641 Sgr. We employed HI and dedicated CO observations of the region to infer the target material for cosmic-ray interactions. We detected multi-TeV emission around V4641 Sgr with a high significance. The emission region is elongated. We found a power-law spectrum with an index $\approx$1.8, and together with results from other gamma-ray instruments, this reveals a spectral energy distribution that peaks at energies of $\approx$100 TeV for the first time. We found indications (3$\sigma$) of a two-component morphology, with indistinguishable spectral properties. The position of V4641 Sgr is inconsistent with the best-fit position of the single-component model and with the dip between the two components. We found no significant evidence of an energy-dependent morphology. No dense gas was found at any distance towards V4641 Sgr. The peak of the SED at $\approx$100 TeV identifies V4641 Sgr as a candidate cosmic-ray accelerator beyond the so-called knee. The absence of dense target gas places stringent energetic constraints on hadronic interpretations, however. The H.E.S.S. measurement requires an unusually hard ($\approx 1.5$) spectral index for the protons. A leptonic scenario faces fewer obstacles if the particle transport is fast enough to avoid losses and to reproduce the observed energy-independent morphology. The absence of bright \xray emission across the gamma-ray emission region requires a magnetic field strength $\lesssim3$ $\mu$G, however. Our findings favour a leptonic origin of the gamma-ray emission. This conclusion does not exclude hadron acceleration in the V4641 Sgr system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UHECRs Propagation and their Multimessengers: Upper limits and the Impact of the Extragalactic Magnetic Field</a><span class="id">[2511.10581]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of high-energy astrophysical multimessengers establishes a connection between ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and powerful cosmic accelerators. Interactions of UHECRs with radiation fields and interstellar matter generate very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays and neutrinos, making them key components in the multimessenger framework. This study examines the cosmogenic gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes resulting from UHECR propagation in starburst galaxies with supernova remnants, with a particular focus on NGC 1068, a well-established high-energy neutrino source. Using extragalactic simulations, we calculate the upper limit on cosmic-ray luminosity, applying upper limits on gamma-ray fluxes derived from observations by H.E.S.S. and MAGIC observatories. Our analysis incorporates the effects of both extragalactic and galactic magnetic fields on particle propagation, constraining the maximum extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) intensity to $10^{-14}~\mathrm{G}$ to ensure that at least 90\% of injected UHECRs successfully reach Earth. The results provide upper limits on gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes, estimates of UHECR luminosity for individual sources, and predictions for the detection capabilities of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory regarding gamma-ray emission from NGC 1068. Combining gamma-ray, neutrino, and UHECR observations reinforces the importance of multimessenger approaches in understanding the nature of high-energy astrophysical sources and their role in cosmic-ray acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A new multiprobe analysis of modified gravity and evolving dark energy</a><span class="id">[2511.10616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the $(w_0, \, w_a)$ parametrization of the dark energy (DE) equation of state, with and without the effective field theory of dark energy (EFTofDE) framework to describe the DE perturbations, parametrized here by the braiding parameter $\alpha_B$ and the running of the Planck mass $\alpha_M$.

Using the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations, we quantify the mass and radial dependence of baryonic suppression of the matter power spectrum by selectively replacing halos in the collisionless run with their full-physics counterparts. We find that group-scale halos with log $M_{200m}/h^{-1} M_{sun}$ in [13, 14] dominate the suppression, contributing a large fraction of the total reduction in power at k   5-30 h/Mpc. The suppression is smaller on either side of this mass bin. Correctly reproducing the full suppression of the power spectrum requires accounting for matter redistribution (while enforcing mass conservation) beyond the virial radius of each halo. Crucially, the same group-scale regime produces the strongest and most detectable deviations in group-galaxy lensing, making stacked group lensing a powerful observational test of feedback models. Our results motivate emulators that jointly predict the matter power spectrum and halo-matter correlations including baryonic effects, enabling unbiased cosmological inference from small scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.10644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We build upon previous analytical treatments of scalar perturbations in curved inflationary universes to obtain analytical templates for the primordial tensor power spectrum in models with non-zero primordial spatial curvature.

For various choices of such EFTs, we identify the discovery space for current and future cosmic microwave background surveys, including the Simons Observatory and CMB-HD. We show this discovery space depends sensitively on the flavor structure and exhibits a rich interplay with terrestrial and astrophysical probes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finite Populations &amp; Finite Time: The Non-Gaussianity of a Gravitational Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2511.09659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong evidence for an isotropic, Gaussian gravitational wave background (GWB) has been found by multiple pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). The GWB is expected to be sourced by a finite population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) emitting in the PTA sensitivity band, and astrophysical inference of PTA data sets suggests a GWB signal that is at the higher end of GWB spectral amplitude estimates. However, current inference analyses make simplifying assumptions, such as modeling the GWB as Gaussian, assuming that all SMBHBs only emit at frequencies that are integer multiples of the total observing time, and ignoring the interference between the signals of different SMBHBs. In this paper, we build analytical and numerical models of an astrophysical GWB without the above approximations, and compare the statistical properties of its induced PTA signal to those of a signal produced by a Gaussian GWB. We show that interference effects introduce non-Gaussianities in the PTA signal, which are currently unmodeled in PTA analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for screened scalar forces with long-baseline atom interferometers</a><span class="id">[2511.09750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Screened scalars are ubiquitous in many dark-sector models. They give rise to non-trivial fifth forces whilst evading experimental constraints through density-dependent screening mechanisms. We propose equipping a 10 m-scale long-baseline atom interferometer with an annular planar source mass inside the vacuum chamber to search for such screened fifth forces. Two key challenges arise: distinguishing the static fifth force from backgrounds, and isolating it from the plate's Newtonian gravity. We introduce the `$Q$-flip protocol', which alternates between interferometry sequences to induce controllable time-dependence, aiding signal extraction and de-trending of transient noise. We further develop an \emph{in situ} calibration procedure to characterise the plate's Newtonian gravity and reach shot-noise-limited sensitivity. We show that our proposal could test theoretically motivated parameter space, advancing existing bounds in chameleon and symmetron screened scalar models by $1$ to $1.5$ orders of magnitude. Our proposal is directly applicable to forthcoming experiments, such as AION-10 or VLBAI, and is readily extensible to broader theoretical models and longer baselines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10086" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trapped and Unstable: Axion-like particle fragmentation at finite temperature</a><span class="id">[2511.10086]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the emergence of a resonant behavior in axion-trapped misalignment models featuring finite-temperature potential barriers.

We show that this process constitutes a novel source of gravitational waves (GWs), analogous to those generated in zero-temperature axion fragmentation, but with distinct characteristics. We quantify the resulting GW spectrum, identifying the peak frequency and amplitude associated with the inhomogeneous axion dynamics. Our results indicate that the GW signal can be enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to the standard fragmentation scenario, while exhibiting a markedly different spectral shape. The parameter space featuring both strong GW signals and reproducing the correct dark matter abundance is, however, limited.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confronting dark energy in Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity with observational data</a><span class="id">[2511.10263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on a comprehensive analysis of recent observational data-a combination of DESI DR1, Planck CMB, and Pantheon+ SN Ia-this study critically evaluates the two dark energy (DE) proposals within Harada's Conformal Killing Gravity (CKG) model. The model in question predicts either a dominant phantom-type effective DE component with EoS $\omega = -5/3$ or a hybrid scenario combining a cosmological constant ($\omega = -1$) with a subdominant $\omega = -5/3$ fluid (around $5\%$) to address the Hubble tension (HT) and late-time acceleration. An analysis based on the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) demonstrates that the pure CKG fluid scenario $\omega = -5/3$ is excluded, whereas the hybrid model remains only marginally compatible. Our Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis constrains the effective DE density parameter to $\Omega_{\text{eff}} = 0.009^{+0.006}_{-0.007}$ ($68\%$ CL), consistent with zero and ruling out the around $5\%$ contribution required by Harada's CKG. The resulting Hubble expansion history $H(z)$ and effective EoS $\omega_{\text{eff}}(z)$ are indistinguishable from those of $\Lambda$CDM. Bayesian model comparison via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) shows no statistical preference for CKG over $\Lambda$CDM ($\Delta \text{AIC} = +2.6$), disfavoring the additional complexity of the CKG model. The key output of this study is that both DE proposals in Harada's CKG are ruled out by current cosmological data, and HT remains unresolved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron Heat Flux and Whistler Instability in the Earth's Magnetosheath</a><span class="id">[2511.10275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite heat flux's role in regulating energy conversion in collisionless plasmas, its properties and evolution in the magnetosheath downstream of the Earth's bow shock are scarcely explored.

The slow decay of the scalar field into RHNs can induce an early matter-dominated (EMD) era whose duration is sensitive to the RHN mass and gauge coupling $g^\prime$. This non-standard cosmological phase reshapes the GW spectrum and leaves a distinctive RHN-mass-dependent spectral distortion that correlates with the flavour regime of thermal leptogenesis. Within this framework, one RHN can serve as a dark matter candidate produced nonthermally from scalar decays, while the remaining states generate the baryon asymmetry via thermal leptogenesis. For $g^\prime=0.5$, we identify such a parameter region, and show that with singlet extensions, even with a smaller gauge coupling, one can realise this mechanism for the three-flavour regime. The resulting GW signals, amplified by supercooling and modified by EMD, provide a unique window to probe the scale and flavour structure of leptogenesis in future high-frequency GW observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bubble Friction in Symmetry-Restoring Transitions</a><span class="id">[2511.10415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In standard (symmetry-breaking) first-order phase transitions, the frictional pressure on expanding bubble walls can be dominated by transition radiation – the emission of a gauge boson with phase-dependent masses as particles present in the thermal plasma pass through bubble walls. This process is enhanced in the soft limit, and is known to produce a significant frictional effect that is proportional to the Lorentz factor $\gamma$ of the bubble wall, thereby prohibiting runaway behavior. We calculate the analogous pressure for phase transitions with symmetry restoration. In such transitions, we show that the pressure due to this process can be $\textit{negative}$, producing the opposite effect. However, when the Lorentz factor of the wall gets very large, the result approaches the same scaling as the standard scenarios. Therefore, phase transitions with symmetry restoration can feature an intermediate negative friction regime even in the presence of significant interactions with the plasma, and the bubble wall terminal Lorentz factor can be significantly larger (by more than an order of magnitude) than in the corresponding symmetry-breaking scenarios. This can carry important implications for various phenomenological applications, from gravitational waves to physics beyond-the-Standard-Model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Fast Earth-scattering Formalism for Light Dark Matter with Dark Photon Mediators</a><span class="id">[2511.10589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While Dark Matter (DM) is typically assumed to interact only very weakly with the particles of the Standard Model, many direct detection experiments are currently exploring regions of parameter space where DM can have a large scattering cross section. In this scenario, DM may scatter in the atmosphere and Earth before reaching the detector, leading to a distortion of the DM flux and a daily modulation of the signal rate as the detector is shielded by more or less of the Earth at different times of day. This modulation is a distinctive signature of strongly-interacting DM and provides a powerful method of discriminating against time-independent backgrounds. However, the calculation of these Earth-scattering effects by Monte Carlo methods is computationally intensive, inhibiting a systematic exploration of the DM parameter space. Here, we present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating Earth-scattering effects, for models of MeV-mass DM which interacts via a dark photon mediator, and release the associated code Verne2. This formalism assumes that DM travels along straight-line trajectories until it scatters and is reflected back along its incoming path, along us to taking into account the affects of both attenuation and reflection in the Earth. We compare this formalism with the results of full Monte Carlo simulations for cross sections within reach of current and future DM-electron scattering searches. We find that Verne2 is accurate to better than 10-30%, making it suitable for performing signal modeling in the search for daily modulation, while reducing the computational cost by a factor of $\sim10^4$ compared to full Monte Carlo simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter and Baryon Asymmetry from Monopole-Axion Interactions</a><span class="id">[2511.10603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a novel mechanism where the kinetic energy of a rotating axion can be dissipated by the interactions with dark magnetic monopoles.

The monopoles acquire masses from a nonzero axion field, and they can transition between different quantized dyonic levels in the presence of a rotating axion field.

This extraction requires solving a quartic equation, which, in many applications, is done numerically using an iterative root-finding method.

In this study, we apply perturbation theory to the minimally extended varying speed of light (meVSL) model to investigate the effects of a varying speed of light on the matter density contrast and the Newtonian gravitational potential. Unlike conventional models with a constant speed of light, the meVSL model introduces modifications to the cosmological evolution equations, leading to potential deviations in structure formation and gravitational interactions. By deriving and analyzing the perturbed equations within this framework, we explore how a varying speed of light affects the growth of density perturbations and the evolution of gravitational potentials. Compared to the standard constant speed of the light model, we find deviations of approximately $2$\% in the subhorizon modes of both quantities. Although detecting these effects observationally remains a significant challenge, our results provide new theoretical insights into the meVSL model and its potential observational signatures, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and gravitational lensing of the CMB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Host Galaxies of Fast Radio Bursts Track a Combination of Stellar Mass and Star Formation, Similar to Type Ia Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2504.08038]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a new statistical framework for studying the host galaxies of astrophysical sources that accounts for both redshift evolution and the multi-variate nature of host-galaxy properties. These aspects are critical when dealing with sources that span a wide range of redshifts, and/or with unknown redshift-dependent selection effects. We apply our method to a sample of Fast Radio Burst (FRB) host-galaxies as a means of probing the uncertain progenitor(s) of these events. Using our method we are able to rule out that FRBs track star-formation rate (SFR), as would be expected if FRBs are associated exclusively with young neutron stars born via core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Furthermore, we rule out a recently proposed metallicity-dependent model whereby FRBs track SFR only above an oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H)   8. Motivated by the fact that at least one FRB has been localized to a globular cluster (GC), we also investigate the hypothesis that FRB sources track GC mass and explicitly rule out this scenario. Alternatively, we find that a `mixed' model whereby FRBs track a linear combination of both SFR and stellar-mass best explains the data. The preferred parameters of such a mixed model are similar to those inferred for Type Ia SNe, and implies a possible connection between the progenitors of these different transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectroscopic r-Process Abundance Retrieval for Kilonovae III: Linking Spectral and Light Curve Modeling of the GW170817 Kilonova</a><span class="id">[2504.10696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observed spectra and light curves of the kilonova produced by the GW170817 binary neutron star merger provide complementary insights, but modeling both the spectral- and time-domain has proven challenging. Here, we model the optical/infrared light curves of the GW170817 kilonova, using the properties and physical conditions of the ejecta as inferred from detailed modeling of its spectra. Using our software tool SPARK, we first infer the r-process abundance pattern of the kilonova ejecta from spectra obtained at 1.4, 2.4, 3.4, and 4.4 days post-merger. From these abundances, we compute time-dependent radioactive heating rates and the wavelength-, time-, and velocity-dependent opacities of the ejecta. We use these inferred heating rates and opacities to inform a kilonova light curve model, to reproduce the observed early-time light curves and to infer a total ejecta mass of $M_{\mathrm{ej}} = {0.11}~M_{\odot}$, towards the higher end of that inferred from previous studies. The combination of a large ejecta mass from our light curve modeling and the presence of both red and blue ejecta from our spectral modeling suggests the existence of a highly magnetized hypermassive neutron star remnant that survives for $\sim$$0.01 - 0.5$ s and launches a blue wind, followed by fast, red neutron-rich winds launched from a magnetized accretion disk.

These systems have separations intermediate to predictions from standard binary evolution scenarios, challenging models of binary interaction and mass transfer. Because the selection function of Gaia astrometric catalogs is complex, the underlying population demographics of WD+MS binaries remain imperfectly understood. We present a forward-model of the AU-scale WD+MS binary population probed by Gaia that begins with a realistic binary population and incorporates a full model of Gaia mock observations and astrometric model fitting, as well as cuts employed in producing the Gaia astrometric catalog and selecting WD+MS binary candidates. We model the formation of AU-scale WD+MS binaries as the result of interaction when the WD progenitor is an AGB star. We test several models for the binaries' formation, including stable mass transfer with theoretically predicted stability criteria and two different formalisms for common envelope evolution. None of these models succeed in reproducing the observed component mass distributions or the absolute number of WD+MS binaries. The data are best reproduced by a model in which post-AGB binaries remain wide only if the accretor-to-donor mass ratio exceeds $\sim 0.4$. Our model allows us to constrain the intrinsic population demographics of intermediate-separation WD+MS binaries. The inferred period distribution is close to flat, with ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}P_{\rm orb}\propto P_{\rm orb}^{0.12}$, while the WD mass distribution is sharply peaked at $0.6\,M_{\odot}$.

If associated with the occulter, these detections suggest that the occulter is gas-rich. Further, we detect blue-shifted and broad ($\sim 200$ km/s) H$\alpha$ line, which likely originates in the inner circumstellar disk. We confirm the previously reported occultations in 1981 and 1937 seen in historic data, yielding a semi-major axis of the occulter's orbital motion around the star of 14 AU. If the occulter is a circumsecondary disk filling 30-100% of the Hill radius, we estimate the minimum mass of the secondary to be a few Jupiter masses and a disk mass of 1% of the mass of the Moon. Given the age of the star ($&gt;2$ Gyr), the disk is unlikely to be a survivor of the planet formation stage and may be a result of a planetary collision.

Our goals are to estimate the fundamental parameters of both binary systems and their components. Methods. We performed first phase-resolved multi-band photometry of both objects with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias and fitted the obtained light curves with a model assuming direct heating of the companion by the pulsar. Archival X-ray data obtained with the Swift and XMM-Newton observatories were also analysed. Results. For the first time, we firmly identified both systems in the optical. Their optical light curves show a rather symmetric single peak per orbital period and a peak-to-peak amplitude of $\gtrsim$2 mag. We also identified the X-ray counterpart to J1627$+$3219, while for J0312$-$0921 we set an upper limit on the X-ray flux. Conclusions. We estimated the masses of the pulsars, companion temperatures and masses, Roche lobe filling factors, orbital inclinations, and the distances to both systems. PSR J0312$-$0921 has a very light ($\approx$0.02 M$_\odot$) companion which possibly has one of the lowest ($\approx$1600 K) `night-side' temperatures among the known black widow systems. We found that the distances to J0312$-$0921 and J1627$+$3219 are about 2.5 and 4.6 kpc, respectively. This likely explains their faintness in X-rays.

It is generally assumed that massive stars cannot form black holes in the upper mass gap because pair instabilities in the late stage of stellar evolution disrupt the stars, whereas the lower mass gap refers to the gap between the maximum allowed neutron star mass and the smallest black hole mass expected to form in supernova explosions. Here we explore a &quot;premature collapse&quot; scenario in which upper mass gap stars collapse and form black holes before they reach the late stage of stellar evolution. The mechanism for triggering a premature collapse is the capture of a smaller black hole, possibly primordial in nature. A similar capture scenario can occur to produce black holes in the lower mass gap. At least for massive stars, typical stellar rotation rates would likely result in rapidly rotating black holes in such a scenario, naturally explaining the rapid spins inferred from GW231123. Even though our estimates hinge on several parameters with rather large uncertainties, they suggest that, at least in galactic disks, the likelihood of such a capture is small for stars in the upper mass gap, but may lead to a significant population of black holes in the lower mass gap and, in fact, even below the lower mass gap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2510.20628]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</a><span class="id">[2510.27022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity.

Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03172" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the spectral characteristics of the periodic burster 4U 1323-62: Type-I X-ray burst and persistent emission</a><span class="id">[2511.03172]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the results obtained by the analysis of persistent and type-I thermonuclear X-ray burst emission observed from the periodic burster 4U 1323-62. These analyses are based on the NuSTAR observation performed on 2024 August 7 for a total exposure of around 90 ks. The persistent emission is well described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model. An absorption edge is also detected at an energy of approximately 7.87 keV, which indicates the presence of absorbing material in the vicinity of this system. Six bursts have been observed during this observation, wherein we find the burst recurrence time to be approximately 4.52 hr. All the bursts exhibit the characteristics of a sharp rise and exponential decay. We perform the time-resolved spectroscopy of the burst spectra described by a model consisting of thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a varying persistent emission component to study the evolution of burst parameters. The enhancement of the persistent emission during burst exposure is characterized by the scaling parameter f a, which reflects the increasing strength of the burst-disc interaction with burst intensity, likely driven by Poynting-Robertson drag. The spectral analysis of bursts estimate the average apparent blackbody emitting radius of the neutron star to lie within 1.5-3.5 km. The ignition depths computed from the burst parameters indicate short Type-I thermonuclear bursts from a mixed hydrogen-helium fuel layer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dark Energy Survey Supernova Program: A Reanalysis Of Cosmology Results And Evidence For Evolving Dark Energy With An Updated Type Ia Supernova Calibration</a><span class="id">[2511.07517]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present improved cosmological constraints from a re-analysis of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year sample of Type Ia supernovae (DES-SN5YR). This re-analysis includes an improved photometric cross-calibration, recent white dwarf observations to cross-calibrate between DES and low redshift surveys, retraining the SALT3 light curve model and fixing a numerical approximation in the host galaxy colour law. Our fully recalibrated sample, which we call DES-Dovekie, comprises $\sim$1600 likely Type Ia SNe from DES and $\sim$200 low-redshift SNe from other surveys. With DES-Dovekie, we obtain $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.330 \pm 0.015$ in Flat $\Lambda$CDM which changes $\Omega_{\rm m}$ by $-0.022$ compared to DES-SN5YR. Combining DES-Dovekie with CMB data from Planck, ACT and SPT and the DESI DR2 measurements in a Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM cosmology, we find $w_0 = -0.803 \pm 0.054$, $w_a = -0.72 \pm 0.21$. Our results hold a significance of $3.2\sigma$, reduced from $4.2\sigma$ for DES-SN5YR, to reject the null hypothesis that the data are compatible with the cosmological constant. This significance is equivalent to a Bayesian model preference odds of approximately 5:1 in favour of the Flat $w_0 w_a$CDM model. Using generally accepted thresholds for model preference, our updated data exhibits only a weak preference for evolving dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adsorption of volatiles on dust grains in protoplanetary disks</a><span class="id">[2511.09481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The adsorption of volatile molecules onto dust grain surfaces fundamentally influences dust-related processes, including condensation of gas-phase molecules, dust coagulation, and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Using advanced ab-initio density functional theory with r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 van der Waals functionals, we calculate adsorption energies of H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO on carbonaceous (graphene, amorphous carbon) and silicate (MgSiO$_3$) surfaces. Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.1-0.2~{\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.5-1.5~{\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tests of General Relativity with GWTC-3</a><span class="id">[2112.06861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ever-increasing number of detections of gravitational waves (GWs) from compact binaries by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors allows us to perform ever-more sensitive tests of general relativity (GR) in the dynamical and strong-field regime of gravity. We perform a suite of tests of GR using the compact binary signals observed during the second half of the third observing run of those detectors. We restrict our analysis to the 15 confident signals that have false alarm rates $\leq 10^{-3}\, {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In addition to signals consistent with binary black hole (BH) mergers, the new events include GW200115_042309, a signal consistent with a neutron star–BH merger. We find the residual power, after subtracting the best fit waveform from the data for each event, to be consistent with the detector noise. Additionally, we find all the post-Newtonian deformation coefficients to be consistent with the predictions from GR, with an improvement by a factor of  2 in the -1PN parameter. We also find that the spin-induced quadrupole moments of the binary BH constituents are consistent with those of Kerr BHs in GR. We find no evidence for dispersion of GWs, non-GR modes of polarization, or post-merger echoes in the events that were analyzed. We update the bound on the mass of the graviton, at 90% credibility, to $m_g \leq 1.27 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$. The final mass and final spin as inferred from the pre-merger and post-merger parts of the waveform are consistent with each other. The studies of the properties of the remnant BHs, including deviations of the quasi-normal mode frequencies and damping times, show consistency with the predictions of GR. In addition to considering signals individually, we also combine results from the catalog of GW signals to calculate more precise population constraints. We find no evidence in support of physics beyond GR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops from simulation</a><span class="id">[2411.10366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the results of performing computational gravitational backreaction on cosmic string loops taken from a network simulation. The principal effect of backreaction is to smooth out small-scale structure on loops, which we demonstrate by various measures including the average loop power spectrum and the distribution of kink angles on the loops. Backreaction does lead to self-intersections in most cases, but these are typically small. An important effect discussed in prior work is the rounding off of kinks to form cusps, but we find that the cusps produced by that process are very weak and do not significantly contribute to the total gravitational-wave radiation of the loop. We comment briefly on extrapolating our results to loops as they would be found in nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04068" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detectability of Massive Boson Stars using Gravitational Waves from Fundamental Oscillations</a><span class="id">[2502.04068]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Boson Stars are macroscopic self-gravitating configurations made of complex scalar fields. These exotic compact objects would manifest as dark Boson stars and, in the absence of electromagnetic signatures, could mimic properties of compact stars in the gravitational wave spectrum. In a recent study, using the simplest potential for massive Boson stars, we demonstrated that fundamental non-radial oscillations ($f$-modes) obey scaling relations that allow them to be distinguished from neutron stars and black holes. In this work, we provide analytical fits for these scaling relations, valid for the dark matter parameter space compatible with current astrophysical and cosmological data, that can be directly incorporated into future studies of massive Boson stars in the strong coupling regime, avoiding the need for numerical calculations. We also provide analytical fits for empirical and universal relations for gravitational wave asteroseismology, which can be used to infer microscopic dark matter properties following a successful detection. Further, we investigate the possibility of detection of $f$-modes and the dark matter parameter space that can be probed with current and future gravitational wave detectors across multiple frequency bands. Assuming a burst gravitational wave model and demanding a signal-to-noise ratio of 5, we show that the current and future detectors can, in principle, probe Boson star $f$-modes up to cosmological distances: 1 Mpc with aLIGO, 30 Mpc with Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, and in the best case scenario, about 300 Mpc with LISA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13597" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Finite-temperature bubble nucleation with shifting scale hierarchies</a><span class="id">[2503.13597]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Focusing on supercooled phase transitions in models with classical scale symmetry, we formulate a state-of-the art framework for computing the bubble-nucleation rate, accounting for the presence of various energy scales. In particular, we examine the limitations of derivative expansions in constructing a thermal effective field theory for bubble nucleation. We show that for gauge field fluctuations, derivative expansions diverge after the leading two orders due to the strong variation in gauge field masses between the high- and low-temperature phases. By directly computing these contributions using the fluctuation determinant, we capture these effects while also accounting for large explicit logarithms at two loops, utilising the exact renormalisation group structure of the EFT. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach significantly improves nucleation rate calculations compared to leading-order results, providing a more robust framework for predicting gravitational-wave signals from supercooled phase transitions in models such as the SU(2)cSM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loops in inflation with strongly non-geodesic motion</a><span class="id">[2503.18516]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study loop corrections in the effective field theory of inflation with imaginary speed of sound, which has been shown to provide an effective description of multi-field inflationary models characterized by strongly non-geodesic motion and heavy entropic perturbations. We focus on the one-loop corrections to the scalar and tensor power spectra, taking into account all relevant vertices at leading order in derivatives and in slow-roll. We find a power-law dependence of the scalar two-point function on the scale that defines the range of validity of the effective theory, analogous to the enhancement observed in tree-level correlation functions. Even more dramatic, the relative correction to the tensor spectrum is exponentially enhanced, albeit also suppressed in the slow-roll limit. In spite of these large effects, our results show that this class of models can satisfy the requirement of perturbative control and a consistent loop expansion within a range of parameters of phenomenological interest. On the other hand, models predicting large values of the power spectrum on small scales are found to be under strong tension. As a technical bonus, we carefully explain the prescription for the regularization and manipulation of loop integrals in this set-up, where one has a non-trivial domain of integration for time and momentum integrals owing to the regime of validity of the effective field theory. This procedure is general enough to be of potential applicability in other contexts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking the KM3-230213A Neutrino Event to Dark Matter Decay and Gravitational Wave signals</a><span class="id">[2504.16040]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event, dubbed KM3-230213A. This is the first observed neutrino event with energy of the order of $\mathcal{O}(100) {\rm PeV}$, the origin of which remains unclear. In this paper, we interpret this high energy neutrino event in terms of the Dirac fermion dark matter (DM) $\chi$ decays via the right-handed (RH) neutrino portal assuming the Type-I seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses and mixings. Furthermore, the Dirac fermion dark matter $\chi$ is assumed to be charged under $U(1)_X$ dark gauge symmetry, which is spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the dark Higgs $\Phi$. In this scenario, DM can decay into a pair of Standard Model (SM) particles, such as neutrinos, leptons, and gauge bosons via the RH neutrino portals for $v_\Phi \gg m_\chi$. Then we can reply on the HDMSpectra package to generate the neutrino and $\gamma$-ray spectra from heavy DM decays. If the DM mass is around $440\ {\rm PeV}$ with a lifetime $5\times 10^{29}$ sec, it can account for the KM3-230213A event. However, such heavy DM cannot be produced through the thermal freeze-out mechanism due to overproduction and violation of unitarity bounds. We focus on the UV freeze-in production of DM through a dimension-5 operator, which helps in producing the DM dominantly in the early Universe. Finally, the large value of the dark Higgs field VEV opens up the intriguing possibility of generating gravitational waves (GWs) spectra from cosmic strings. We have found a reasonable set of parameter values that can address the KM3NeT signal, yield the correct value of the DM relic density through freeze-in mechanism, and allow for the possible detection of GW signal at the future detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18892" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$g$-mode oscillations of dark matter admixed neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2506.18892]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly.

In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01675" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexei Starobinsky and Modern Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2509.01675]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Alexei Starobinsky is one of the main authors of inflationary cosmology.

Several dark energy scenarios are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, and BA parameterizations, along with non-flat cosmologies allowing for spatial curvature ($\Omega_k \neq 0$). Our analysis supports a flat Universe with $\Omega_k \approx 0$. Using MCMC techniques, we constrain these models with observational data from DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, Type Ia supernovae, and compressed CMB likelihoods. The results provide strong statistical evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, favoring dynamical dark-energy behavior consistent with a Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on the total neutrino mass, $\sum m_\nu$, using CMB + DESI DR2 data: $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\Lambda$CDM and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\mathrm{eV}$ for $\omega$CDM. In the non-flat extensions, o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM, the limits relax to $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\mathrm{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\mathrm{eV}$, respectively. For the other models $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE the constraints range between $&lt;0.043$ and $&lt;0.127~\mathrm{eV}$. The effective number of relativistic species remains consistent with the standard value, $N_{\mathrm{eff}} = 3.044$, across all models. Bayesian evidence further shows that combining DES-SN5Y or Union3 supernova samples with CMB + DESI DR2 produces measurable deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Although no model reaches the $5\sigma$ significance threshold, several exhibit tensions exceeding $3\sigma$, suggesting emerging cracks in the cosmological constant paradigm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environments around Black Holes from Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.27424]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF).

The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially revealing the properties of the dark sector and shedding light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs.
