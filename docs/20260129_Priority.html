The observations were taken as part of a pilot project for the MAJORS large program at the JCMT telescope. By incorporating prior knowledge of N(H$_2$) and $T_K$, assuming a constant density, and using the RADEX radiative transfer code we found that the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances range from $X$(HCN) = $0.4-7.0 \times 10^{-8}$ and $X$(HCO$^+$) = $0.4-7.3 \times 10^{-9}$. Additional modelling using the NAUTILUS chemical evolution code, that takes H$_2$ density variations into account, however, suggests the HCN and HCO$^+$ abundances may be fairly constant. Careful modelling of three different positions finds $X$(HCN) = $1.3-1.7 \times 10^{-8}$, $X$(HCO$^+$) = $1.3-3.1 \times 10^{-9}$. Cross-comparison of the two models also provides a crude estimate of the gas density producing the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission, with H$_2$ densities in the range $5 \times 10^4 - 5 \times 10^5$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting that the HCN and HCO$^+$ emission does indeed arise from dense gas. High UV intensity (e.g. $G_o &gt;$ a few thousand) has no effect on the abundances in regions where the visual extinction is large enough to effectively shield the gas from the UV field. In regions where $A_V &lt; 6$, however, the abundance of both species is lowered due to destructive reactions with species that are directly affected by the radiation field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An X-ray-Emitting Proto-Cluster at $z\approx5.7$ Reveals Rapid Structure Growth</a><span class="id">[2601.19978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the universe and serve as tracers of the assembly of large-scale structure. Studying their progenitors, proto-clusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. Yet, detecting proto-clusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization. Recent JWST observations located several proto-cluster candidates by identifying overdensities of $z\gtrsim5$ galaxies. However, none of these candidates was detected by X-ray observations, which offer a powerful way to unveil the hot ICM. Here, we report the combined Chandra and JWST detection of a proto-cluster, JADES-ID1, at $z\approx5.68$, merely one billion years after the Big Bang. We measure a bolometric X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm bol} = (1.5^{+0.5}_{-0.6}) \times10^{44} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$ and infer a total gravitating mass of $M_{500}= (1.8^{+0.6}_{-0.7}) \times 10^{13} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, making this system a progenitor of today's most massive galaxy clusters. The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as $z\approx5.7$. In addition, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The CO snow line favours strong clumping by the streaming instability in protoplanetary discs with porous grains</a><span class="id">[2601.19985]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: The radial drift and fragmentation of small dust grains in protoplanetary discs impedes their growth past centimetre sizes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to overcome these planet formation barriers, such as dust porosity or the streaming instability (SI), which is today regarded as the most promising mechanism to form planetesimals. Aims: Here, we examine whether the conditions for the SI to lead to strong clumping, the first step in planetesimal formation, are realised in protoplanetary discs containing porous grains. Methods: We used results from previous simulations of the evolution of porous grains subjected to growth, fragmentation, compaction and bouncing in protoplanetary discs. In the ensuing disc structures, we determined the regions where the dust-to-gas ratio exceeds the critical value for strong clumping found in simulations of the SI including external turbulence. Results: We find that the conditions for strong clumping are met within the first hundred thousand years in large regions of protoplanetary discs containing porous grains, provided that the CO snow line is taken into account. If the CO snow line is neglected, the conditions are met only very close to the inner disc edge early on, or over large areas well after 200,000 yr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GLIMPSE-D: Metallicity Decline in Faint Galaxies: Implications for [O III]+Hb Luminosity Function and Reionisation Budget</a><span class="id">[2601.19989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the measurement of the R3=[O III]5008/Hb ratios for 54 galaxies in the GLIMPSE-D survey. Thanks to gravitational lensing, our sample includes galaxies with -20 &lt; Muv &lt; -14 at z=6-9. We derive oxygen abundances using calibrated relationships. We observe a significant decline in R3 values below Muv &gt; -18, which we interpret as evidence of decreasing metallicities in fainter regimes. We explore four prescription models of the evolution of R3 with UV emission based on the new measurements and results from previous surveys. Applying these models to the GLIMPSE [O III]+Hb luminosity functions, we measure and extrapolate the ionising photon production rate $\dot{N}_{ion}$ of galaxies down to very faint limits SFR(Ha) &gt; 5e-3 Msun/yr. Our results support the dominant contribution of star-forming galaxies to reionisation, and are consistent with the recent discovery of ultra-faint metal-poor galaxies. Our measurements of the relative contribution of each luminosity bin show that galaxies with L(Ha) 1e41 to 1e42 erg/s dominate at 8&lt;z&lt;9, but the relative contributions become more uniform at $7&lt;z&lt;8$. Extreme models either under- or over-estimate the ionising photon budget, while intermediate models align with recent observational constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A GLIMPSE into the UV Continuum Slopes of the Faintest Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2601.19995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As observations have yet to constrain the ionizing properties of the faintest (M$_{\rm UV}$ &gt; -16) galaxies, their contribution to cosmic reionization remains unclear. The rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) continuum slope ($\beta$) is a powerful diagnostic of stellar populations and one of the few feasible indicators of the escape fraction of ionizing photons (f$_{\rm esc}$) for such faint galaxies at high-redshift. Leveraging ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam GLIMPSE imaging of strong lensing field Abell S1063, we estimate UV continuum slopes of 555 galaxies at z $&gt;$ 6 with absolute magnitudes down to M$_{\rm UV}$ $\simeq -$12.5. We find a modest evolution of $\beta$ with redshift and a flattening in the $\beta$-M$_{\rm UV}$ relation such that galaxies fainter than M$_{\rm UV}$ $\sim -$16.5 no longer exhibit the bluest UV slopes. The 138 ultra-faint galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}$ $&gt; -$16 are a diverse population encompassing dusty (30\%), old (15\%), and low-mass (50\%) galaxies. We apply the empirical $\beta$-f$_{\rm esc}$ relation from local Lyman continuum leakers, finding the mean f$_{\rm esc}$ peaks at $\sim 20\%$ at M$_{\rm UV}=-$16.5 and declines towards fainter galaxies, while remaining consistent with f$_{\rm esc}$ = 14\% within uncertainties, in agreement with recent radiative transfer simulations. Incorporating GLIMPSE constraints on the UV luminosity function, ionizing photon production efficiency, and escape fractions produces a reionization history consistent with independent observational constraints. Our results indicate galaxies with M$_{\rm UV}$ between $-18$ and $-14$ supplied $\sim 60\%$ of the ionizing photons to cosmic reionization, while the lower f$_{\rm esc}$ of fainter galaxies produces a natural cutoff in the ionizing photon production rate density.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GLIMPSE-DDT spectroscopic properties of faint-end galaxies at $z\sim6$: Towards first metal enrichment, dust production, and ionizing photon production</a><span class="id">[2601.20045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultra-faint galaxies at high-$z$ are fundamental elements of the early galaxy assembly, and spectroscopic characterization of this population is essential to understand the earliest galaxy evolution. Leveraging the ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam and NIRSpec observations of a gravitational lensing field of Abell S1063, taken as part of the GLIMPSE survey, we present spectroscopic properties of 16 galaxies fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-17$ mag, including the metallicity, dust attenuation, and the ionizing photon production efficiency. The emission lines are generally quite strong, roughly half of which cannot be replicated with standard stellar populations and require an extreme ionizing source. We also identify relatively strong [OIII] emission lines from all sample galaxies, which indicates that the low-mass end of the mass-metallicity relation is extended down to $M_\star\sim10^6\ M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$. The strong [OIII] line detection from the lowest-mass galaxy among the sample ($M_\star\sim10^{5.6}\ M_\odot$) stands in contrast to recent reports of extremely metal-poor galaxy candidates at similar mass and redshift, suggesting that there could be two distinct pathways of the earliest metal enrichment as simulations have predicted. Interestingly, we detect both dust attenuation and galactic outflow in one of the sample galaxies with $M_\star=10^{6.6}\ M_\odot$ at $z=5.5$. All the dust, metal, and outflow contents in this galaxy can be consistently explained by supernovae (SNe), indicative of the key roles of SNe in the earliest galaxy assembly such as dust production, metal enrichment, stellar feedback, and baryon cycle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatial distribution of organics in the Horsehead nebula: signposts of chemistry driven by atomic carbon</a><span class="id">[2601.20146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Abridged) Complex organic molecules (COMs) are considered essential precursors to prebiotic species. While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\sim 15^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From cosmological simulations to binary black hole mergers: The impact of using analytical star formation history models on gravitational-wave source populations</a><span class="id">[2601.20202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of binary black hole (BBH) mergers provide a unique window into the lives of massive stars across cosmic time. Connecting redshift-dependent merger properties to massive star progenitors requires accurate models of cosmic star formation and chemical enrichment histories. Analytical fits for the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation rate density S(Z, z) are commonly used as proxies for the complex underlying star formation history, yet they remain unconstrained. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we evaluate the accuracy of these analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions and assess how simulation resolution and volume affect the inferred S(Z, z). By coupling the simulated and analytical S(Z, z) to the population synthesis code COMPAS, we investigate the resulting BBH merger rates and mass distributions. We find that analytical S(Z, z) prescriptions can overestimate BBH merger rates at high redshift ($z \gtrsim 6$) by up to a factor of $10$-$10^4$, depending on cosmological simulation resolution, and can introduce spurious features in the BBH mass distribution. For example, they can produce an artificial feature near $8\,M_\odot$ in the primary mass distribution at $z \lesssim 2$, which is absent when using the full simulation-based S(Z, z), while simultaneously suppressing high-mass features. These discrepancies arise because simple analytical models fail to capture a high-metallicity bump and a more flattened low-metallicity tail in the simulated S(Z, z) metallicity distribution. Our results highlight the importance of accurate star formation histories for modeling BBH populations, demonstrate the limitation of widely used analytical S(Z, z) fits, and underscore the need for careful integration of cosmological simulations, analytical fits, and population synthesis when interpreting gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metallicity Structure in Galactic Longitude-Velocity Diagrams of the Milky Way Disk and FIRE-2 Simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.20278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate longitude-velocity ($\ell$-$v$) diagrams as a diagnostic tool to study the metallicity structure of the Milky Way (MW) disk. The present-day metallicity structure encodes the imprint of the Galaxy's formation, assembly, and secular evolution. Using oxygen abundances from HII regions across the MW disk, together with MW-mass galaxies from the Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological simulations, we show that $\ell$-$v$ diagrams trace radial metallicity gradients and non-axisymmetric azimuthal metallicity variations. Because they do not rely on distance measurements, $\ell$-$v$ diagrams complement face-on maps for studying metallicity structure. In the MW, we detect the radial metallicity gradient in $\ell$-$v$ space, but current HII region oxygen abundance errors are too high to reveal azimuthal variations. In the FIRE-2 MW-mass galaxies, the radial gradient is evident in $\ell$-$v$ diagrams regardless of observer location, but anomalous gas kinematics can mimic azimuthal metallicity variations. We term these &quot;anomalous motions&quot;, which have an excess local standard of rest (LSR) velocity tail 3 times larger in the FIRE-2 simulations compared to the MW. Our results highlight $\ell$-$v$ diagrams as a largely unexplored tool for probing metallicity structure without requiring distances, and underscore discrepancies between the gas kinematics in the FIRE-2 simulations and those in the MW.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Quiescent Galaxy in a Gas-Rich Cosmic Web Node at z 3</a><span class="id">[2601.20473]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations have unveiled a large number of quiescent galaxies at $z\gtrsim3$, bringing potential challenges to current galaxy formation models. Since star formation is expected to be fed by external gas accretion, the knowledge about the circumgalactic media (CGM) of these galaxies is essential to understanding how they quench. In this work, we present the discovery of a massive and passive galaxy ($M_\star\simeq10^{11}\,M_\odot$) within the MQN01 structure at z 3.25, containing one of the largest overdensities of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) found so far at $z\gtrsim3$. The passive galaxy has a star-formation rate of $4^{+6}_{-2}~M_\odot$/yr, placing it more than 1 dex below the star-forming main sequence, and has no detectable molecular gas ($M_\mathrm{H2}&lt;7\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$). Surprisingly, it is located at the center of a large cool gas reservoir, as traced by bright Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ emission. By taking advantage of deep multi-wavelength information unique to this field, including deep Chandra X-ray data, we argue that the inefficient gas accretion from the CGM onto this galaxy over the last few hundreds of Myr, as suggested by the observations, could be caused by an AGN jet of a nearby star-forming galaxy located at a projected distance of 48 kpc. In particular, we argue that the jet feedback may have maintained a high level of CGM turbulence around the passive galaxy and thus caused a reduced gas accretion over the required time-scales. In addition, the elevated ionizing field provided by the AGN overdensity, including the nearby AGN, can illuminate the passive galaxy's cool CGM and make it visible through fluorescent emission. Our study demonstrates that the star formation rates of high-redshift galaxies could be substantially reduced and maintained at a low level even within gas-rich and overdense environments in particular situations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massive dusty multiphase outflow in local merger shows no sign of slowing on kiloparsec scales</a><span class="id">[2601.20489]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use ALMA CO(1-0) observations and VLT/MUSE rest-frame optical data of the ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) IRAS20100-4156 at $z=0.1297$ to characterize its powerful outflow in multiple phases using tracers of cold molecular, ionized, and neutral atomic gas and dust as well. Our analysis uses the correspondence with the stellar velocity field to split the complex emission line profiles of the CO(1-0) line into components in gravitational and non-gravitational motion. We find a massive ($8\times10^{9}\,M_\odot$) molecular outflow containing about 40% of the total molecular gas mass in the system. The outflow shows a bi-conical morphology centered on the brightest galaxy in the merger, oriented along its minor axis and extending to $\sim5\,\mathrm{kpc}$. This outflow has a characteristic velocity of $170\,\mathrm{km/s}$, an outflow mass rate of $700\,M_\odot/\mathrm{yr}$, a depletion time of $16\,\mathrm{Myr}$, and energetics consistent with star formation as a driver. The neutral atomic and ionized gas phases traced by NaI absorption and H$\alpha$ emission show counterparts to the blueshifted cold molecular outflow but are only 15% and 3% as massive. None of the three gas phases show any signs of slowing down over the extent at which we detected the outflow, suggesting an acceleration mechanism acting on the outflowing gas at kiloparsec scales. We also detect $3.5\times 10^7\,M_\odot$ of dust, traced by optical extinction in the MUSE data, in the blueshifted outflowing cold molecular gas. The ionization state of the non-outflowing gas is consistent with star formation, while the outflowing component shows shock-like ionization. We conclude that the multiphase outflow in IRAS20100-4156 originates in the southeast nucleus of the merger and is driven by the starburst activity there, with radiation pressure likely playing a significant role in its acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An unexpected population of quenched galaxies harbouring under-massive SMBHs revealed by tidal disruption events</a><span class="id">[2601.20519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Restricted by event horizon suppression, tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide a unique window into otherwise hidden supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the lower end of the mass spectrum, allowing the connection between star formation and SMBH mass to be explored across a broad stellar mass range. We derive stellar masses and specific star formation rates using Prospector fits to UV-MIR broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 42 TDE hosts, together with a high-mass comparison sample, and combine these with SMBH mass estimates from the literature. We first verify our approach by reproducing the established result that quenched galaxies host more massive SMBHs than star-forming systems at fixed stellar mass, a result widely interpreted as evidence for SMBH growth driving the blue-to-red sequence transition. However, examining the TDE sample in isolation reveals a trend reversal at lower masses, uncovering a surprising population of low-mass ($10^{9.6} \lesssim M_{\rm gal} \lesssim 10^{10.5}$ M$_\odot$), quenched galaxies hosting SMBHs systematically less massive ($M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{6.5}$ M$_\odot$) than those in star-forming galaxies of comparable stellar mass. After ruling out degeneracies in our SED fits, we conclude that this reflects a physical difference in the quenching mechanism between these TDE hosts and the more massive galaxies. This is unlikely to be driven by AGN feedback, and could instead result from environmental processes, which can end star formation and hinder SMBH growth. We also show that the quenched and post-starburst population within the TDE sample is likely under-represented due to selection biases, suggesting the true fraction could be even higher than observed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20545" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analyzing PAHs as a Tracer of Anomalous Microwave Emission Near the Galactic Plane Using the COSMOGLOBE DIRBE Reduction</a><span class="id">[2601.20545]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physical mechanism producing Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) has been an unresolved puzzle for close to 30 years. One candidate mechanism is rotational emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which can have the necessary electric dipole moment and size distribution to account for the AME in representative interstellar environments. However, previous investigations have found that AME is better correlated with the far-infrared dust emission rather than the PAH emission. In this work we analyze the correlations between the AME and the PAH and far-infrared dust emission using the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission feature as observed by band 3 of the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE). This analysis builds on previous work conducted in individual molecular clouds and extends it into fainter, more diffuse structures. In addition, we utilize the COSMOGLOBE DIRBE reduction for this work, building on previous studies that used the original DIRBE data set. We find that the AME is better correlated with far-infrared dust emission ($\rho\sim$0.9) than the PAH emission ($\rho\sim$0.7) in the central $|b|\leq$ 10\degree\ region of the sky. This could indicate either that non-PAH dust grains or an alternative physical emission mechanism is primarily responsible for the AME in the Galactic Plane, or that the excitation conditions for mid-infrared emission and for AME from PAHs differ substantially.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing the link between halo mass and radio jet activities in quasars</a><span class="id">[2601.20576]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is a fundamental lack of understanding as to why quasars that are otherwise very similar can have such a wide range of radio jet powers, and the large-scale environment is thought to play an important role. We investigate the spatial clustering properties of 225,382 quasars from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) within the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) Data Release 2 footprint, split by the statistically-calculated fraction of their radio flux densities contributed by jets (relative to the contribution from star formation). We find a positive correlation between the clustering strengths of quasars and their jet fraction, where quasars with a higher jet fraction have a higher clustering amplitude measured by their two-point correlation functions. We show that this correlation is unlikely related to differences in BH masses or bolometric luminosities. Quasars dominated by powerful jet activities generally reside in dark matter haloes $10-100$ times more massive than those without strong jets, with typical halo masses of $10^{13-14}\ h^{-1}M_\odot$, establishing a robust link between powerful AGN jets and rich cluster environments. Our results demonstrate that halo mass is important for determining the power of radio jets, but suggest that there is no minimum dark matter halo mass or BH mass required for the triggering of jets. The observed correlation suggests that BH spin is likely to play a minor role in jet production; instead, the key driver could be the presence of a strong magnetic flux.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20698" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The IACOB project: XVI. Surface helium abundances in Galactic O-type stars: indications for identifying binary interaction products</a><span class="id">[2601.20698]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of massive O-type stars with surfaces enriched by CNO-cycle products has been known since the early 1980s. For many years, internal rotational mixing was assumed to be the dominant mechanism responsible for this chemical contamination. However, accumulating evidence now suggests that binary interaction – particularly mass-transfer episodes – may play an equally important, if not dominant, role. We aim to carry out a large-scale investigation of surface helium (He) abundances in Galactic O-type stars, based on the results from the analysis of high-quality spectroscopic data from the IACOB project. We perform a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of 318 Galactic O-type stars with the IACOB-BROAD and FASTWIND/IACOB-GBAT tools, deriving rotational velocities, atmospheric parameters, and He abundances. We also account for the influence of binarity, runaway status, and parameter degeneracies (e.g., microturbulence, wind properties, diagnostic lines, and companion contamination) on the abundance determinations. We present homogeneously determined surface He abundances (YHe=N(He)/N(H)) for the so far largest, statistically significant sample of Galactic O-type stars. About 78% of the stars show He abundances consistent with the previously proposed cosmic abundance standard of YHe=0.098$\pm$0.002. The remaining 22% display clear He enrichment (YHe&gt;0.13). We also provide observational evidence indicating that most of these He-enriched stars are likely the products of binary interaction. Our study highlights how large spectroscopic surveys are gradually opening robust observational avenues to identify the products of massive binary interaction. It also emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting the spectroscopic properties of apparently single O-type stars. A significant fraction may in fact be the outcome of binary evolution rather than isolated stellar birth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20837" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Encounters Between M33 and Present-Day M31 Satellites Hint at a Previous Group Accretion</a><span class="id">[2601.20837]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates whether two known Andromeda (M31) satellites, Pisces (LGS 3) and Andromeda XVI, have interacted with M33, M31's most massive satellite. $\Lambda$CDM predictions imply a handful of satellite galaxies around M33, yet few M33 satellites have been found and confirmed despite its high mass. We use proper motions combined with backward orbit integration in a semi-analytic potential to constrain plausible interaction scenarios for Pisces and And XVI. Both dwarfs are currently M31 satellites, defined as being inside its virial radius. However, our results show that, in our fiducial mass models, 42% (And XVI) and 60% (Pisces) of dwarf orbits support that they were previously satellites of M33 (i.e., once inside its virial radius). Both dwarfs had fly-by encounters with M33 at relative velocities greater than M33's escape speed within the past 1-2 Gyr. In over 70% of orbits, Pisces and And XVI also had a close approach with each other post-M33 interaction and share an orbital plane, suggesting possible past group accretion. We explore a range of mass combinations for M31 and M33, finding that this primarily regulates the likelihood that the dwarfs were satellites of M33 in the past, while upholding conclusions of recent flybys about M33. These close interactions provide new evidence for past satellite exchange and/or group infall scenarios between M31 and M33. Such interactions also affect comparisons to observational surveys that define satellites primarily by their distance relative to host galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular Gas Detections in Eight Faint DSFGs with Red NIR Colors at z = 1.2-2.5</a><span class="id">[2601.20862]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a NOEMA survey of CO(3-2), CO(4-3), and [C I]($^3$P$_1$-$^3$P$_0$) in eight faint (average $S_{\rm 850 \mu m} = 2.3$ mJy) dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) at $z = 1.2-2.5$. We used a NIR flux-color cut to match faint SCUBA-2 sources to red stellar counterparts with existing spectroscopic redshifts, allowing us to target CO lines at known frequencies. We obtained seven new CO detections and a serendipitous [C I] detection in an off-axis source, and measured molecular gas masses of $M_{\rm mol} = (6-22)\times10^{10}~(\alpha_{\rm CO}/3.6)~{\rm M}_\odot$ from these lines. We performed UV-to-mm SED fits to measure the SFRs and stellar masses of our sample, and compared these with two other $z = 1-3$ CO samples from the literature. The CO detections have constant depletion times of $t_{\rm dep} \sim 500$ Myr, with no evidence for correlation between $t_{\rm dep}$ and redshift or main-sequence offset. We find that low-mass ($M_\star \lesssim 10^{11}~{\rm M}_\odot$), starbursting galaxies have gas fractions and depletion times twice as high as predicted by molecular gas scaling relations, which may indicate that $M_{\rm mol}$ is systematically over-estimated in this population, possibly due to decreased $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ or increased CO excitation compared to the well-studied massive and/or main-sequence DSFG population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20864" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bottom-heavy initial mass functions reveal hidden mass in early galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.20864]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST observations have revealed that massive galaxies formed and evolved far faster than predicted by galaxy formation models, with many having already assembled a large mass in stars $\sim12$ billion years ago [1-7]. However, masses of distant galaxies are highly uncertain, as they assume a distribution of stellar birth masses (the initial mass function [IMF]) similar to that in the Milky Way (MW). Specifically, the contribution from low-mass stars, which make up the bulk of stellar mass, is not directly observed, but inferred based on an extrapolation of the MW IMF. Here, we provide the first robust measurements of the IMF beyond the local Universe. Using ultra-deep spectra of nine massive, quiescent galaxies at $z\sim0.7$ from the ambitious JWST-IMFERNO program, extended to bluer wavelengths with deep spectra from LEGA-C [8], we find that these distant galaxies have excess low-mass stars. In other words, they have more bottom-heavy IMFs than the MW. For the oldest two galaxies, which are direct descendants of JWST's &quot;impossibly early&quot; galaxies, the bottom-heavy IMFs increase their stellar masses by a factor of $3-4$. These galaxies thus amplify the tension with galaxy formation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Analytic Scale-dependent Dark Matter Profile and the Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation</a><span class="id">[2601.20070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we use the recently introduced concept of self-interacting dark matter with scale-dependent equation of state, and we provide an analytic model of dark matter that can produce viable rotation curves even for low-surface-brightness galaxies, irregular galaxies, low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies, all known to challenge the cold dark matter description. The radius dependent effective equation of state of the self-interacting dark matter model we shall introduce is assumed to be an isothermal equation of state of the form $P(r)=K(r)\left(\frac{\rho(r)}{\rho_{\star}}\right)$, where the energy density will have the form $\rho(r)=\frac{\rho_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{5/2}}$, while the entropy function $K(r)$ is $K(r)=\frac{K_0}{\left( 1+\frac{r^2}{\alpha^2}\right)^{1/2}}$. The resulting model is confronted in detail with the SPARC galaxy data and 175 galaxies are used and tested. It proves that the analytic model can successfully produce the rotation curves of 116 galaxies, most of which are small mass spirals, irregular galaxies, low-surface-brightness and low-luminosity spirals and dwarf galaxies. On the other hand, 59 galaxies cannot be successfully described by our analytic model. We tested statistically the correlation between the parameter $K_0$ of the entropy function corresponding to the viable galaxies, and the flat rotation velocity $V_{flat}$ and the maximum rotation velocity $V_{max}$ of the galaxies from the SPARC data. We also examined the baryon mass $M_b$-$K_0$ relation and the luminosity $L$-$K_0$ relation. We have been able to produce the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation for the viable galaxies, directly from the correlation $K_0$-$M_b$ and $K_0$-$V_{flat}$, with the resulting relation being $M_b\sim V_{flat}^{4.026 \pm 0.371}$, however we failed to produce the canonical Tully-Fisher relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When relics were made: vigorous stellar rotation and low dark matter content in the massive ultra-compact galaxy GS-9209 at z=4.66</a><span class="id">[2505.06349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST uncovered a large number of massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) at $z&gt;3$, which theoretical models struggle to reproduce. Explaining the number density of such objects requires extremely high conversion efficiency of baryons into stars in early dark matter halos. Using stellar kinematics, we can investigate the processes shaping the mass assembly histories of MQGs. We present high-resolution JWST/NIRSpec integral field spectroscopy of GS-9209, a massive, compact quiescent galaxy at $z=4.66$ ($\log (M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})=10.52 \pm 0.06$, $R_{eff}=220 \pm 20$ pc). Full spectral fitting of the spatially resolved stellar continuum reveals a clear rotational pattern, yielding a spin parameter of $\lambda_{2R_{eff}}=0.85 \pm 0.10$. This study suggests that at least a fraction of the earliest quiescent galaxies were fast rotators and that quenching was a dynamically gentle process, preserving the stellar disc even in highly compact objects. Using Jeans anisotropic modelling and assuming a NFW profile, we measure a dark matter fraction of $f_{DM} (&lt;2R_{eff}) = 14.5^{+6.0}_{-4.2} \% $. Our findings use stellar kinematics to confirm the massive nature of early quiescent galaxies, previously inferred from stellar population modelling. We suggest that GS-9209 has a similar structure to low-redshift `relic' galaxies. However, unlike relic galaxies which have bottom-heavy initial mass functions (IMF), the dynamically inferred mass-to-light ratio of GS-9209 is consistent with a Milky-Way like IMF. The kinematical properties of GS-9209 are different from those of $z&lt;1$ early-type galaxies and more similar to those of recently quenched post-starburst galaxies at $z&gt;2$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Properties of Irradiated Circumbinary Disks around Binary Black Holes Governed by Hydrogen Opacities Dependent on Temperature and Density</a><span class="id">[2506.14141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the thermal and spectral properties of irradiated circumbinary disks (CBDs) around binary black holes (BBHs), using analytic, hydrogen-based opacity models that capture dependencies on temperature, density, and ionization. We solve the vertical hydrostatic equilibrium and energy balance, assuming gas pressure only, using Rosseland-mean opacities from free-free and bound-free absorption plus electron scattering, with ionization fractions given by the Saha equation. Four opacity models are considered, including a reference model with no physical opacity, constructed by Lee et al. (2024), and three physically motivated alternatives. The midplane temperature profiles show significant variation across models, while the surface temperature remains largely unchanged in regions dominated by viscous heating. Opacity effects become pronounced in the outer disk, where irradiation reprocessing shapes the IR-optical continuum. Bound-free opacity introduces flattening and a mid-frequency peak in the spectral energy distribution. We compute spectra of a triple disk system including the CBD and two accreting minidisks. The high-frequency peak arises from the hot minidisks, while the low-frequency excess originates from irradiated outer CBD layers. Comparing model spectra with detection limits of Subaru, JWST, and Swift, we find that BBH systems within  10 Mpc can exhibit a detectable IR excess. Our results highlight the need for physically consistent opacity modeling to interpret electromagnetic (EM) signatures of BBHs approaching coalescence and support integration of metallicity-dependent opacity tables. Our opacity-informed framework for irradiated CBDs provides an EM template for identifying stellar- to intermediate-mass BBHs in a mass range sparsely sampled by LISA, thereby bridging the gravitational-wave-EM gap with testable IR/optical signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22046" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NIKA2 cosmological legacy survey at 2 mm: catalogs, colors, redshift distributions, and implications for deep surveys</a><span class="id">[2506.22046]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millimeter galaxy surveys are particularly effective in detecting dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshift. While such observations are typically conducted at  1mm, some studies suggest that 2mm may be better suited for selecting sources at even higher redshifts. We use the unprecedented 2mm data from the N2CLS, together with the SIDES simulation, to study and interpret the statistical properties of 2mm-selected galaxies. We use the N2CLS robust sample at 2mm, which contains 25 sources in the deep GOODS-N field and 90 sources in the wide COSMOS. The sources are matched with the N2CLS 1.2mm sources, the ancillary 850um sources, and redshift catalogs to study the colors and redshift distributions. We also produce end-to-end simulations based on SIDES and the observed N2CLS detector timelines to interpret the data. We find a mean S2/S1.2 color of 0.222$\pm$0.008 with a standard deviation of 0.070$\pm$0.010. We measure a mean redshift of $3.6\pm0.3$ in GOODS-N, which is marginally higher than expectations from SIDES ($2.9\pm0.2$) because of an overdensity at $z\sim5.2$, and $3.2\pm0.2$ in COSMOS, which agrees with the $3.2\pm0.2$ predicted by SIDES. We also show that the observed S2/S1.2 colors exhibit a weak dependence with redshift but a large dispersion, which limits its efficiency to select high-z sources. Finally, we studied the nine 2mm sources not detected at 1.2mm, and found that two of them are radiogalaxies, one is a z 2 galaxy, and the remaining six are compatible with the expected number of spurious detections. The N2CLS survey shows no evidence for any exotic 2mm-only galaxy population. Using SIDES, we show that 2mm samples have a higher mean redshift compared to 1.2mm because they miss z 2 dusty galaxies. Finally, we discuss the efficiency of single-dish and interferometric blind surveys to build samples of high-z dusty galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SIGNALS of Giant HII Regions: A Spatially Resolved Analysis of NGC 604</a><span class="id">[2510.03144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observing giant HII regions at fine spatial scales uncovers detailed structures and reveals variations in ionization, abundance, and dynamical properties of ionized gas and the effect of stellar feedback. Using emission line data of M33 observed with SITELLE as part of the Star-formation, Ionized Gas, and Nebular Abundances Legacy Survey (SIGNALS), we present maps of the principal optical emission line ratios for NGC 604, the most luminous HII region in M33. The excitation maps align well with the H$\alpha$ morphology and are clearly related to the location of the central stellar cluster and secondary stellar groups. The maps of ionization-sensitive line ratios show substantial variations across the face of NGC 604. We demonstrate that these variations are unlikely to be due to chemical inhomogeneities but are primarily caused by changes in ionization, which in turn affect the observed line ratios. We present the H$\alpha$ kinematics of the region and connect it to the excitation structure, showing how the dynamic motions influence the spatial distribution of ionized gas. We note two distinct sources identified in these excitation maps: a known supernova remnant and a previously unknown planetary nebula. Such parsec-scale features contribute only a small percentage to the overall light and would remain undetected without the use of high-resolution spatial data. Throughout the paper, we make comparisons to and raise concerns about single-aperture and long-slit spectroscopic measurements of giant HII regions, highlighting the limitations and potential inaccuracies of such methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growth of Metal-Enriched Supermassive Stars by Accretion and Collisions</a><span class="id">[2511.08516]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supermassive stars (SMSs) are candidate progenitors of massive black hole seeds and may contribute to anomalous abundance patterns in high-redshift galaxies and globular clusters. Recent radiation-hydrodynamic simulations indicate that SMSs can form at finite metallicity, not only in metal-free direct-collapse conditions. We model SMS growth with \textsc{GENEC} over $Z/Z_\odot=10^{-5}$-$10^{-2}$ using simulation-motivated accretion histories. The final masses reach $\sim7.2\times10^{4}\,M_\odot$ at $10^{-5}\,Z_\odot$ and $\sim2.3\times10^{3}\,M_\odot$ at $10^{-2}\,Z_\odot$. Models are evolved through the pre-main sequence and core H-burning phases, terminating at the onset of general-relativistic instability for $Z\lesssim10^{-4}\,Z_\odot$ or at core He exhaustion for $Z\gtrsim10^{-3}\,Z_\odot$. The dominant mass growth channel transitions from collision-driven to accretion-driven between $Z=10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}$. With stellar lifetimes remaining nearly constant at $1.8$-$2.0$ Myr, collisions do not significantly rejuvenate the star, implying that collision driven runaway collapse cannot proceed in isolation and must be supplemented, and likely dominated by gas accretion. We further compute the critical inflow rate required to keep the stellar envelope inflated, $\dot{M}_{\rm crit}$, which decreases with increasing $Z$ and decreasing central mass fraction of hydrogen ($X_{\rm c}$). The critical rate falls below $10^{-5}\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ at $X_{\rm c}=0.60$ for $10^{-2}Z_\odot$. This indicates that SMSs with $0.01~Z_\odot$ are cool supergiants during most of their lifetimes, where UV photon emissivity and radiative feedback is strongly suppressed. Overall, SMS evolution remains viable up to $Z\simeq0.01\,Z_\odot$, supporting SMS formation in proto-globular clusters and other metal-enriched dense environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Through Thick and Thin: The Cosmic Evolution of Disk Scale Height</a><span class="id">[2601.04988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To investigate the formation and evolution of vertical structures in disk galaxies, we measure global $\operatorname{sech}^2$ scale heights, averaging thin and thick components when present, for 2631 edge-on disk galaxies with $M_*&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$ at $0&lt;z&lt;3.5$ from the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. We show that dust extinction systematically overestimates scale heights at shorter rest-frame wavelengths, and therefore adopt a fixed rest-frame wavelength of 1 $\mu$m. After further correcting for projection-induced bias using a new accurate method, we find that the median disk scale height increases from $0.56\pm0.03$ kpc at $z=3.25$ to $0.84\pm0.04$ kpc at $z=1.25$, and subsequently decreases to $0.67\pm0.06$ kpc at $z=0.25$. The bias-corrected disk scale-length-to-height ratio remains constant at $2.7\pm0.2$ for $z&gt;1.5$, but rises to $4.0\pm0.4$ at $z=0.25$. These results imply that the high-redshift progenitors of present-day thick disks were of intermediate thickness, neither thin nor thick, yet dynamically hot and dense. The observed radial variation of scale height is consistent with the artificial flaring expected from observational effects, disfavoring minor mergers as the primary mechanism of disk thickening. Instead, we suggest that the high-redshift intermediate-thickness disks were single-component systems that increased their vertical scale height through decreasing surface mass density and/or violent gravitational instabilities, eventually producing thick disks. Thin-disk growth begins at $z\approx2$ and dominates at $z\lesssim1$, yielding a vertically more compact system with decreasing scale heights from $z\approx1$ to $0$. The inferred thin-disk mass fraction increases from $0.1\pm0.03$ at $z=1$ to $0.6\pm0.1$ at $z=0$. Together, these findings reveal a continuous evolutionary link between high-redshift single-component disks and present-day thick thin disk systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated Metallicity Diagnostics for Precision Oxygen Abundance Measurements in High-redshift Galaxies with JWST</a><span class="id">[2601.12413]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent work has demonstrated that widely used strong-line oxygen abundance indicators, such as O3N2, $\rm R23$, and $\widehat{\rm R}$, suffer from large uncertainties when applied to high-redshift galaxies.

Here we develop updated indicators that explicitly incorporate both effects via the proxies O32 and N2O2. We define ${\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm R23+\alpha_1 O32+\alpha_2 N2O2$, $\widehat{\rm R}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm \widehat{R}+\beta_1 O32+\beta_2 N2O2$, and ${\rm O}_{\rm u}\equiv \rm O3N2+\gamma_1 O32+\gamma_2 N2O2$, and calibrate \Oabund as low-order polynomials in each composite indicator. Applied to a JWST sample with $T_{\rm e}$-method abundances, the updated indicators substantially tighten the correlations with \Oabund, boosting adjusted coefficients of determination from $\mathbb{R}^2\lesssim 0$ (classical indicators) to $\mathbb{R}^2\gtrsim 0.5$ for the full sample and to $\sim 0.7$ at $z&gt;2$. The residuals reveal a redshift evolution in the mapping between \Oabund, strong lines, ionization, and nitrogen enrichment, with a pivotal turning point near the cosmic noon ($z\sim 2$).

In these situations continuum normalization is often implemented as a pre-processing step that is independent of stellar parameters. This leads to results that are biased, or inconsistent across signal-to-noise ratios. A more justified approach is to forward model spectra with all nuisances simultaneously, but in practice this can be an expensive or non-convex optimization procedure. Here we describe a constrained linear model that can fit stellar absorption, telluric transmission, the joint continuum-instrument response. Stellar absorption and telluric transmission are each modeled by factorizing a grid of rectified theoretical spectra into two non-negative matrices with a chosen number of basis components. This model characterizes all possible spectra in many fewer parameters than comparable data-driven models. The non-negativity constraint ensures basis vectors are strictly additive, which limits rectified flux to less than or equal to unity, such that we can distinguish normalized spectra from the joint instrument-continuum response. The model requires no initial guess, and the linearity ensures that inference is convex, stable, and fast. This model allows us to reliably fit nuisances (e.g., tellurics, continuum), and is readily extensible to radial velocity and rotational broadening, without any prior knowledge about the fundamental stellar properties. We demonstrate our method by fitting ESO/HARPS high-resolution echelle spectra of BAFGKM-type stars. With repeat observations of $\alpha$-Centauri A we present results that are best in class: consistent across time to 0.2% at S/N   100, and to better than 0.5% at S/N   30.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">POEMMA-Balloon with Radio: A multi-messenger, multi-detector balloon payload</a><span class="id">[2601.19997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A review of the current status of the field of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) including a summary of remaining open questions was presented in the white paper &quot;Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays: at the Intersection of the Cosmic and Energy Frontiers&quot; (Astropart.

The authors concluded that two types of next-generation detectors are needed to answer these questions: high-accuracy instruments and detectors that maximize exposure at the highest energies. The Probe Of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA), a proposed dual-satellite observatory, exemplifies the latter class and is designed to increase statistics of the highest-energy cosmic rays and to detect very-high-energy neutrinos following multi-messenger alerts. POEMMA-Balloon with Radio (PBR) implements a compact, balloon-borne version of the POEMMA concept, adapted for a Super-Pressure Balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, with an expected campaign exceeding 20 days. PBR couples a wide field-of-view Schmidt telescope and a hybrid optical focal surface with a dedicated radio instrument to deliver simultaneous, complementary measurements of extensive air showers. The mission will validate the fluorescence detection strategy from space and raise technology readiness for a POEMMA-like space mission by observing UHECR-induced fluorescence light from suborbital altitudes, obtaining the first simultaneous optical Cherenkov and radio observations of high-altitude horizontal air showers above the cosmic-ray knee (E&gt;3PeV), enabling energy-spectrum and composition studies at the PeV scale, and performing follow-ups of multi-messenger alerts to search for very-high-energy neutrinos via upward-going air showers.

Current glitch classification methods, such as Gravity Spy, rely on supervised models trained from scratch using labeled datasets. These approaches suffer from a significant “label bottleneck,&quot; requiring massive, expertly annotated datasets to achieve high accuracy and often struggling to generalize to new glitch morphologies or exotic GW signals encountered in observing runs. In this work, we present a novel cross-domain framework that treats GW strain data through the lens of audio processing. We utilize the Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST), a model pre-trained on large-scale audio datasets, and adapt it to the GW domain. Instead of learning time-frequency features from scratch, our method exploits the strong inductive bias inherent in pre-trained audio models, transferring learned representations of natural sound to the characterization of detector noise and GW signals, including IMBHs. We validate this approach by analyzing strain data from the third (O3) and fourth (O4) observing runs of the LIGO detectors. We used t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised clustering technique, to visualize the AST-derived embeddings of signals and glitches, revealing well-separated groups that align closely with independently validated Gravity Spy glitch classes. Our results indicate that the inductive bias from audio pre-training allows superior feature extraction compared to traditional supervised techniques, offering a robust, data-efficient pathway for discovering new, anomalous transients, and classifying complex noise artifacts in the era of next-generation detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RM-Tools: Software for Analyzing Polarized Radio Spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.20092]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarization observations using modern radio telescopes cover large numbers of frequency channels over broad bandwidths, and require advanced techniques to extract reliable scientific results.

We present the results from one such effort, the first 24,186 hours of the GREENBURST search for dispersed radio pulses with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT). To date, GREENBURST has detected a total of 50 pulsars and three FRBs. One of the pulsars, PSR J0039+5407, has a period of 2.2 s and was previously unknown. Using follow-up observations with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, we found a timing solution for this pulsar which shows it to have a characteristic age of 2 Myr. Additional GBT observations show the pulsar has a very high nulling fraction ($\sim70-80\%$). All three of the FRBs are repeating sources that were previously known and were being monitored by the GBT as part of other projects. A major challenge for GREENBURST in the discovery of new FRBs is its single beam. This makes it hard to distinguish some of the pulses from sources of radio frequency interference. We highlight this problem with a case study of an FRB-like pulse that initially passed our interference filters. Upon closer inspection, the event appears to be part of a longer-duration narrow-band source of unknown origin. Further observations and monitoring are required to determine whether it is terrestrial or celestial.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Need for Ultra High Resolution X-ray Imaging</a><span class="id">[2601.20823]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper discusses the broad science case for obtaining milliarcsecond to microarcsecond astronomical imaging resolution in the soft to medium-energy X-ray band ( 0.5 to  8 keV). Astronomy across much of the electromagnetic spectrum has been fundamentally transformed with a rapid increase in ground-based and space-based capabilities to examine celestial objects on small scales that relate directly to their relevant physical processes. X-ray imaging capabilities, however, have fallen far behind observations at longer wavelengths. As such, without decisive advances in X-ray imaging, we will be unable to uncover key phenomena on the smallest astrophysical scales, leaving entire classes of high-energy discoveries beyond our reach. Here we describe several science goals for which high quality X-ray imaging is crucial and the status of some current technologies or mission concepts that would be required for these advances. In particular, we discuss the Accretion Explorer, a mission architecture under current study for a dispersed aperture X-ray interferometer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probabilistic Interpolation of Sagittarius A*'s Multi-Wavelength Light Curves Using Diffusion Models</a><span class="id">[2601.20863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the variability of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) requires coordinated, multi-wavelength observations that span the electromagnetic spectrum. In this work, we focus on data from four key observatories: Chandra in the X-ray (2-8 keV), GRAVITY on the Very Large Telescope in the near-infrared (2.2 microns), Spitzer in the infrared (4.5 microns), and ALMA in the submillimeter (340 GHz). These multi-band observations are essential for probing the physics of accretion and emission near the black hole's event horizon, yet they suffer from irregular sampling, band-dependent noise, and substantial data gaps. These limitations complicate efforts to robustly identify flares and measure cross-band time lags, key diagnostics of the physical processes driving variability. To address this challenge, we introduce a diffusion-based generative model, for interpolating sparse, multivariate astrophysical time series. This represents the first application of score-based diffusion models to astronomical time series. We also present the first transformer-based model for light curve reconstruction that includes calibrated uncertainty estimates. The models are trained on simulated light curves constructed to match the statistical and observational characteristics of real Sgr A* data. These simulations capture correlated multi-band variability, realistic observation cadences, and wavelength-specific noise. We compare our models against a multi-output Gaussian Process. The diffusion model achieves superior accuracy and competitive calibration across both simulated and real datasets, demonstrating the promise of diffusion models for high-fidelity, uncertainty-aware reconstruction of multi-wavelength variability in Sgr A*.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing online estimation of CBC parameters with the low-latency MBTA analysis</a><span class="id">[2601.20512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we describe the procedure implemented in the Multi-Band Template Analysis (MBTA) search pipeline to produce online posterior distributions of compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational-wave parameters.

The adopted framework is based on the work of Britton (2000) and Hamaker (2000) and applied to analyze the signal path described by Hamaker et al. (1996) with additional corrections for phase convention and reflection. Some objective criteria for selecting a model of the instrumental response are introduced and discussed, along with some practical guidelines that facilitate polarimetric calibration. Further relevant background material and lengthier mathematical proofs are included in the appendix, which introduces the vector, matrix, and tensor notation and concepts of linear algebra used in this work. The appendix also reviews some of the basics of analog and digital signal processing that are relevant to radio astronomy, and discusses some numerical instabilities that arise when modeling observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">User Guide to UVIT Data Reduction</a><span class="id">[2503.05056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This document provides a user guide for reducing UVIT data using CCDLAB.

Because these instruments aim for extremely high sensitivity, it is essential to understand their various noise sources, how such noise couples to the detector output, and the strategies used to mitigate them. These noises contributions are computed in the frame of the Virgo detector and a sensitivity curve is calculated. Although a simplified layout of a gravitational wave detector is considered, it takes into account the most dominant effects and yields in a sensitivity estimate close to the what is observed in real detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Development of Low-Noise Two-stage dc-SQUID for TES Detector Readout</a><span class="id">[2601.19565]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUIDs) are one of the most sensitive magnetic detectors. These sensors are extensively used in the readout of superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs), which are used for the detection of weak signals. A cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization telescope operating in 22-48 GHz is currently under developing. The TESs calorimeter of the telescope will be readout by a time-division multiplexer (TDM) SQUID readout system. We develop a two-stage dc-SQUID amplifier circuit, comprising an input-stage SQUID with 4 SQUID cells and a series SQUID array (SSA) with 100 SQUID cells. This configuration has been shown to achieve extremely high signal gain while effectively controlling system noise. We assess the system noise at $300$ $mK$ in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator (ADR). The the measured magnetic flux noise of the two-stage SQUID circuit system is approximately $0.3$ ${\mu}\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at $10$ $kHz$. The current noise equivalent to the input coil of input SQUID is about $2.4$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. This result meets the low-noise readout requirements of the CMB TES and other applications with TES detectors.</p></div></details></article></body>
