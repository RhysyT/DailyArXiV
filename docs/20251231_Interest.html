<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Determinism and Indeterminism as Model Artefacts: Toward a Model-Invariant Ontology of Physics</a><span class="id">[2512.22540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper argues that the traditional opposition between determinism and indeterminism in physics is representational rather than ontological. Deterministic–stochastic dualities are available in principle, and arise in a non-contrived way in many scientifically important models. When dynamical systems admit mathematically equivalent deterministic and stochastic formulations, their observable predictions depend only on the induced structure of correlations between preparations and measurement outcomes. I use this model-equivalence to motivate a model-invariance criterion for ontological commitment, according to which only structural features that remain stable across empirically equivalent representations, and whose physical effects are invariant under such reformulations, are candidates for realism. This yields a fallibilist form of structural realism grounded in modal robustness rather than in the specifics of any given mathematical representation. Features such as conservation laws, symmetries, and causal or metric structure satisfy this criterion and can be encoded in observable relations in mathematically intelligible ways. By contrast, the localisation of modal selection – whether in initial conditions, stochastic outcomes, or informational collapse mechanisms – is not invariant under empirically equivalent reformulations and is therefore best understood as a gauge choice rather than an ontological feature. The resulting framework explains how certain long-standing problems in the foundations of physics, including the measurement problem and the perceived conflict between physical determinism and free agency, arise from the reification of representational artefacts. By distinguishing model-invariant structure from modelling conventions, I offer a realist ontology for modern physics that combines empirical openness with resistance to metaphysical overreach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actual Physics, Observation, and Quantum Theory</a><span class="id">[2512.22618]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since its inception, quantum theory has been the subject of fierce interpretive controversy, which persists to this day. Disputed topics include the basic ontology and dynamics of the theory, the role (if any) of measurement, the meaning of probability, and the issue of non-locality. But there is yet another problem that has been largely ignored: how the theory makes contact with observational data. The problem is endemic to physics, and was discussed by Einstein in several places. In this essay, I discuss Einstein's general approach, how it applied to some quantum-mechanical phenomena, and why a central aspect of the solution might lead to novel and important new predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Huygens' derivation of the laws of elastic collisions</a><span class="id">[2512.22842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this note I sketch the work of Christiaan Huygens to develop a theory of motion and its application to elastic collisions. In this theory he uses the relativity of uniform linear motion to derive the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy (at the time referred to as living force or vis viva). The conservation of living force was used subsequently by Leibniz as a basic general principle of dynamics, an alternative to that of Newton set forth in the Principia Mathematica.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Event Horizons, Spacetime Geometry, and the Limits of Integrated Consciousness</a><span class="id">[2512.23105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>What happens to a unified conscious field when its physical implementation straddles a black hole event horizon? This paper addresses that question for integration-based theories, including Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace Theory, and Predictive Processing. These views share a structural commitment: unity requires a single strongly connected component (SCC) in an effective causal graph over a finite integration window $\tau$. Using the standard black hole causal structure, I show that no SCC can span an event horizon. Any theory that ties unity to strong connectivity must therefore accept that a single conscious field cannot remain numerically identical and unified across such a configuration. From the perspective of the theories themselves, the outcome is bifurcation: each causally connected subsystem continues to satisfy the very structural criteria the theory declared necessary for a unified field. On any such view, the number and boundaries of unified conscious fields are therefore fixed not by the substrate alone but by the conjunction of its internal architecture with the relativistic causal structure of the spacetime it occupies, a dependency that ordinary spacetime conceals by supplying it so abundantly, but which an event horizon abruptly withdraws.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment on &quot;There is No Quantum World&quot; by Jeffrey Bub</a><span class="id">[2512.22965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a recent preprint [1] Jeffrey Bub presents a discussion of neo-Bohrian interpretations of quantum mechanics, and also of von Neumann's work on infinite tensor products [2]. He rightfully writes that this work provides a theoretical framework that deflates the measurement problem and justifies Bohr's insistence on the primacy of classical concepts. But then he rejects these ideas, on the basis that the infinity limit is &quot;never reached for any real system composed of a finite number of elementary systems&quot;. In this note we present opposite views on two major points: first, admitting mathematical infinities in a physical theory is not a problem, if properly done; second, the critics of [3,4,5] comes with a major misunderstanding of these papers: they don't ask about &quot;the significance of the transition from classical to quantum mechanics&quot;, but they start from a physical ontology where classical and quantum physics need each other from the beginning. This is because they postulate that a microscopic physical object (or degree of freedom) always appears as a quantum system, within a classical context. Here we argue why this (neo-Bohrian) position makes sense.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.06018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model. One of the important property of the Lemaitre – Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson). In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that &quot;similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physicists Are Still Joking</a><span class="id">[2512.17948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This volume, \textbf{Physicists Are Still Joking}, serves as a definitive almanac of scientific humor spanning sixty years.

<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1d-qt-ideal-solver: 1D Idealized Quantum Tunneling Solver with Absorbing Boundaries</a><span class="id">[2512.22634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present 1d-qt-ideal-solver, an open-source Python library for simulating one-dimensional quantum tunneling dynamics under idealized coherent conditions. The solver implements the split-operator method with second-order Trotter-Suzuki factorization, utilizing FFT-based spectral differentiation for the kinetic operator and complex absorbing potentials to eliminate boundary reflections. Numba just-in-time compilation achieves performance comparable to compiled languages while maintaining code accessibility. We validate the implementation through two canonical test cases: rectangular barriers modeling field emission through oxide layers and Gaussian barriers approximating scanning tunneling microscopy interactions. Both simulations achieve exceptional numerical fidelity with machine-precision energy conservation over femtosecond-scale propagation. Comparative analysis employing information-theoretic measures and nonparametric hypothesis tests reveals that rectangular barriers exhibit moderately higher transmission coefficients than Gaussian barriers in the over-barrier regime, though Jensen-Shannon divergence analysis indicates modest practical differences between geometries. Phase space analysis confirms complete decoherence when averaged over spatial-temporal domains. The library name reflects its scope: idealized signifies deliberate exclusion of dissipation, environmental coupling, and many-body interactions, limiting applicability to qualitative insights and pedagogical purposes rather than quantitative experimental predictions. Distributed under the MIT License, the library provides a deployable tool for teaching quantum mechanics and preliminary exploration of tunneling dynamics.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawksmoor's Ceiling, Mercator's Projection and the Roman Pantheon</a><span class="id">[2512.22327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ceiling of the Buttery in All Souls College, Oxford, designed by the English Baroque architect Nicholas Hawksmoor, has a vaulted form on an oval base. It is coffered with an array of approximately square sunken lacunaria, whose sizes and positions vary so as to accommodate the constraints of the curved surface and its boundaries. A similar design appears in the dome of the Roman Pantheon. Using methods of differential geometry, we hypothesise that these cofferings should be the images under conformal mappings of regular square tilings of a rectangle or finite cylinder. This guarantees that the coffer ribs meet exactly at right angles and the coffers are close to being square. These mappings are simply the inverse of Mercator's projection of the curved surface onto a plane. For a ceiling which is a general surface of revolution, we derive formulae for the dimensions and location of each coffer. Our results, taking into account camera distortion, are in excellent agreement with photographs of the Hawksmoor ceiling and the Pantheon dome, as well as with recent direct measurements of the latter. We also describe a protocol by which Hawksmoor's ceiling might have been constructed without advanced mathematics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physicists Are Still Joking</a><span class="id">[2512.17948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This volume, \textbf{Physicists Are Still Joking}, serves as a definitive almanac of scientific humor spanning sixty years.
