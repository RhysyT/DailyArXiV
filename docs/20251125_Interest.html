<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quantum Spacetime: Echoes of basho</a><span class="id">[2511.17691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I will discuss how the concept of basho, introduced by Nishida Kitaro nearly a century ago, can give an interesting insight to understand the concept of a point in modern quantum gravity. A quantum spacetime, necessary for the quantization of gravity, requires a whole rethinking of geometry, starting from the primitive concepts, like that of a point. I argue that the local vision of what becomes of classical points in quantum gravity, and in particular in noncommutative geometry, shows several similarities with Nishida's basho.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A demonstration that classical gravity does not produce entanglement</a><span class="id">[2511.19242]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement on independent grounds. A Newton-Cartan analysis shows that if gravity is classical, a mediator, and entanglement is observed as an outcome of performing a GIE experiment, something other than gravity must have supplied the (virtual) force needed during the experiment to produce the effect.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enabling Blind and Visually Impaired Individuals to Pursue Careers in Science</a><span class="id">[2511.17620]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blind and Visually Impaired (BVI) Individuals face significant challenges in science due to the discipline's reliance on visual elements such as graphs, diagrams, and laboratory work. Traditional learning materials, such as Braille and large-print textbooks, are often scarce or delayed, while practical experiments are rarely adapted for accessibility. Additionally, mainstream educators lack the training to effectively support BVI students, and Teachers for the Visually Impaired (TVIs) often lack scientific expertise. As a result, BVI individuals remain underrepresented in scientific jobs, reinforcing a cycle of exclusion. However, technological advancements and inclusive initiatives are opening new opportunities. Outreach programs aim to make science engaging and accessible for BVI individuals through multi-sensory learning experiences. Hands-on involvement in these activities fosters confidence and interest in scientific careers. Beyond sparking interest, equipping BVI students with the right tools and skills is crucial for their academic success. Early exposure to assistive technologies enables BVI students to navigate scientific studies independently. Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools further enhance accessibility by converting visual data into descriptive text and providing interactive assistance. Several learning sessions demonstrated the effectiveness of these interventions, with participants successfully integrating into university-level science programs. Educating BVI and their teachers on these tools and good pratices is the aim of our project AccesSciencesDV. Research careers offer promising opportunities for BVI, especially in computational fields. By leveraging coding, data analysis, and AI-driven tools, BVI researchers can conduct high-level scientific work without relying on direct visual observations. The presence of BVI scientists enriches research environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18244" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Developing an AI Course for Synthetic Chemistry Students</a><span class="id">[2511.18244]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and data science are transforming chemical research, yet few formal courses are tailored to synthetic and experimental chemists, who often face steep entry barriers due to limited coding experience and lack of chemistry-specific examples. We present the design and implementation of AI4CHEM, an introductory data-driven chem-istry course created for students on the synthetic chemistry track with no prior programming background. The curricu-lum emphasizes chemical context over abstract algorithms, using an accessible web-based platform to ensure zero-install machine learning (ML) workflow development practice and in-class active learning. Assessment combines code-guided homework, literature-based mini-reviews, and collaborative projects in which students build AI-assisted workflows for real experimental problems. Learning gains include increased confidence with Python, molecular property prediction, reaction optimization, and data mining, and improved skills in evaluating AI tools in chemistry. All course materials are openly available, offering a discipline-specific, beginner-accessible framework for integrating AI into synthetic chemistry training.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fractional Contribution of Dynamical and Geometric Phases in Quantum Evolution</a><span class="id">[2511.13090]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fundamental division of the total quantum evolution phase into geometric and dynamical components is a central problem in quantum physics. Here, we prove a remarkably simple and universal law demonstrating that this partitioning is governed, at every instant, solely by a single geometric quantity: the Bargmann angle (Bures angle). This result provides a universally applicable and rigorous way to define the exact fraction of the total phase that is geometric versus dynamical in origin, thereby establishing a new quantitative link between the dynamics of quantum evolution and the geometry of the state space. This finding has immediate practical consequences, furnishing a real-time measure of the geometricity of an evolution for designing high-fidelity geometric quantum gates with optimized robustness, and opening new avenues for quantum speed limit and coherent control.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 1908 Tunguska event and some distant phenomena</a><span class="id">[2511.17549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper is a continuation of a series of works, devoted to various aspects of the 1908 Tunguska event. This usually refers to an explosive phenomenon associated with the appearance of a forestfall, named nowadays as the Kulikovskii one. However, several other notable natural phenomena occurred in the Central Siberia on June 30, 1908. This paper considers geomorphological features, reports of substance discoveries, forestfalls, and earthquakes. The general conclusion is that the Tunguska event was a very complex phenomenon. Research of the Tunguska event requires the participation of experts in various fields.</p></div></details></article></body>
