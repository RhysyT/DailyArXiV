Our design was closely based on that of the groundbreaking 2014 Duke University Lightboard but with a smaller glass pane, 5 feet wide instead of 6 feet wide. The resulting scaled-down board is small enough to move in and out of individual faculty offices, but large enough to make detailed videos. An updated construction cost estimate is provided, and recent upgrades are briefly discussed. We believe that personalized office-based lightboarding represents an attractive option for many faculty members, with strengths that complement those of centralized installations. Our successful build suggests that this option is technically and financially feasible at many if not most higher education institutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A sterile-neutrino search using data from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber performed in an undergraduate teaching laboratory</a><span class="id">[2509.18859]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fundamental particle physics is a key part of an undergraduate physics curriculum, but can be challenging to incorporate into teaching laboratories. We present an undergraduate laboratory experiment that enables students to work with real data from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber to search for the existence of a sterile neutrino: a new, fourth, neutrino state. This search has galvanized physicists for decades, as the existence of sterile neutrinos could play a critical role in understanding fundamental processes in the early universe, provide viable dark matter candidates, and offer a natural explanation for the origin of neutrino masses. From an experimental point of view, anomalies observed in several neutrino experiments provide tantalizing hints of their existence. The analysis presented here, whilst based on real data, has been adapted as a pedagogical tool for an undergraduate teaching laboratory, in which students are asked to develop an understanding of neutrino oscillation theory, analyse a MicroBooNE data sample, and apply statistical methods to search for a potential sterile neutrino. The analysis incorporates machine learning techniques to improve event classification. Students are encouraged to explore these and other methods to optimize their results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenging the Model Minority Myth: A MAIHDA Study of Asian Student Outcomes in Introductory Physics</a><span class="id">[2509.19049]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The model minority myth obscures the educational disparities among Asian student groups in physics education. This study estimated the variation in conceptual physics knowledge across 19 Asian racial/ethnic groups at the start and end of introductory physics courses. Utilizing data from the LASSO platform, we analyzed responses from 16,810 students enrolled in 493 introductory calculus-based physics courses across 64 U.S. institutions. We applied Multilevel Analysis of Individual Heterogeneity and Discriminatory Accuracy (MAIHDA) to analyze the student outcomes with the Force Concept Inventory and Force and Motion Conceptual Evaluation. We found that the predicted posttest score of the lowest performing group is the same as the predicted pretest score of the highest performing group. Disaggregated data reveal performance differences among Asian groups that aggregated reporting conceals. To avoid the challenges that can arise when disaggregating data, instructors and researchers must consider many factors, such as research questions and/or methodological constraints. By leveraging the expanded identity options within the LASSO platform and the MAIHDA model, our approach offers a powerful framework for exposing hidden disparities and advancing equity in STEM education.</p></div></details></article></body>
