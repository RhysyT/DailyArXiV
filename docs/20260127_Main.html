We study the system in two physically distinct regimes: the near degenerate low temperature limit, and the high temperature regime. In the low temperature regime, we derive the thermodynamic quantities using the standard Sommerfeld expansion. In the high temperature regime, we evaluate all thermodynamic quantities numerically from the exact grand canonical potential and demonstrate that the thermodynamics of the Fermi gas reduces to the standard relativistic ideal gas behavior. We apply the resulting low temperature equation of state to study compact astrophysical objects, namely, non rotating white dwarfs and neutron stars. Helium white dwarfs exhibit a strong dependence on the deformation scale, while white dwarfs composed of heavier elements are less affected. For neutron stars, the modified equation of state leads to configurations that are smaller in radius and lower in mass than is by nucleonic equations of state. Our results highlight how modified relativity theories can be probed by studying astrophysical objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring Rotation Periods in Crowded Star Clusters with TESS: A Proof-of-Concept with NGC 3532</a><span class="id">[2601.17116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed nearly the entire sky, producing full-frame images (FFIs) every 30 min (Cycles 1$-$2), 10 min (Cycles 3$-$4), and now 200 s (Cycle 5+), over 27-day sectors. Light curves extracted from FFIs can be used to measure stellar rotation periods ($P_{\rm rot}$) in nearby open clusters, and are well-suited for studying low-mass stars ($\lesssim$1.2 M$_\odot$) younger than $\approx$1 Gyr, whose $P_{\rm rot}$ are generally still $\leq$15 days. A challenge to exploiting TESS data fully is its 21$''$ pixel size, which can cause strong signals from a source to contaminate the signals of nearby sources in the crowded environments found, e.g., in the more distant and/or richest clusters. We conducted a test with the young ($\approx$350 Myr old), moderately distant (470 pc), and rich open cluster NGC 3532 ($N_\star$ &gt; 3000), which has an extensive $P_{\rm rot}$ catalog from ground-based photometry, to examine the reliability of $P_{\rm rot}$ obtained from TESS data. We recovered 69% of the literature periods from at least one of the three TESS cycles in which NGC 3532 was observed before any quality analysis. We then used all available TESS data for low-mass members of NGC 3532 and, applying a set of quality cuts that combined information from TESS and from Gaia, measured $P_{\rm rot}$ for 885 cluster stars, adding 706 new $P_{\rm rot}$ to the existing catalog. We conclude that, when considered with appropriate caution, TESS data for stars in crowded fields can yield reliable $P_{\rm rot}$ measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-Equilibrium Relativistic Core Collapse of Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos – Limits On Seed Black Hole Mass</a><span class="id">[2601.17117]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshifts pose challenges to standard seeding mechanisms. Among competing models, the collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos provide a plausible explanation for early SMBH formation. While previous studies on modeling the gravothermal collapse of SIDM halos have primarily focused on non-relativistic evolution under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, We advance this framework by relaxing the equilibrium assumption and additionally incorporating general-relativistic effects. To this end, we introduce the Misner-Sharp formalism to the SIDM context for the first time. Our model reproduces the standard hydrostatic models in the early long-mean-free-path (LMFP) regime, but displays interesting distinct behavior in the late short-mean-free-path (SMFP) regime, where intense outward heat flux drives a rapid expansion of the outer envelope, removing mass from the core and significantly decelerating the collapse. Our general relativistic treatment enables us to follow halo evolution to the final stage when the apparent horizon forms. Our simulation yields a seed black hole mass of approximately $3\times10^{-8}$ of the halo mass at horizon formation, suggesting that additional mechanisms such as baryonic effects are critical for seeding black holes that are sufficiently massive to account for SMBHs in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17278" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of dust in a protoplanetary disc driven by stellar flybys: implications for the streaming instability</a><span class="id">[2601.17278]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar flybys are a common dynamical process in young stellar clusters and can significantly reshape protoplanetary discs. However, their impact on dust dynamics remains poorly understood, particularly in the weakly coupled regime (St$\gg$1). We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of parabolic stellar flybys-both coplanar and inclined-interacting with a gaseous and dusty protoplanetary disc. Dust species with Stokes numbers ranging from 15 to 100, corresponding to four grain sizes under a uniform initial gas surface density, are included. Perturber masses of 0.1 and 1$\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ are considered. The induced spiral structures exhibit distinct dynamical behaviours in gas and dust: dust spirals retain a nearly constant pattern speed, while gas spirals gradually decelerate. The pitch angles of both components decrease over time, with dust evolving more rapidly. In the weakly coupled regime, gas and dust spirals are spatially offset, facilitating dust accumulation around both structures. Equal-mass flybys truncate the disc at approximately $\sim$0.55$r_{\mathrm{Hill}}$, producing tightly wound, ring-like spirals that promote dust concentration. By mapping the streaming instability growth rates in the solid abundance-Stokes number space across three evolutionary phases, we find that a low-mass flyby suppresses dust concentration below the critical clumping threshold after periastron and maintains this suppression over time, indicating long-lasting inhibition of dust clumping. An equal-mass flyby raises local solid abundance well above the threshold, suggesting that such encounters may foster conditions favourable for dust clumping. Flyby-induced spirals play a central role in shaping dust evolution, leading to distinct spatial and temporal behaviours in weakly coupled discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Quintessence Models with ISW-tSZ Cross-Correlations: A Comparative Analysis of Thawing, Tracker, and Scaling-Freezing Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2601.17298]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present constraints on quintessence dark energy models using the observational detection of the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW)–thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) cross-correlation dataset. Our analysis compares three classes of quintessence dynamics: thawing, tracker, and scaling-freezing with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Through a comprehensive likelihood analysis, we derive best-fit values and 68\% confidence intervals for key cosmological parameters, finding $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.322^{+0.027}_{-0.030}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.735^{+0.045}_{-0.035}$ for $\Lambda$CDM, with deviations in alternative models consistent within $1\sigma$. For the thawing model, we consider an exponential potential with slope $\lambda = 0.736^{+0.270}_{-0.227}$, while for the tracker and scaling-freezing models, we use inverse axion-like and double exponential potentials, respectively. Observationally, the tracker model yields $n = 5.651^{+1.625}_{-1.604}$ and $f = 0.258^{+0.149}_{-0.096}$, and the scaling-freezing model gives $\lambda_1 = 0.405^{+0.293}_{-0.322}$ and $\lambda_2 = 23.226^{+7.975}_{-7.258}$. The dimensionless tSZ amplitude ($\widetilde{W}^{\rm SZ}$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) parameters are tightly constrained across all models, providing additional insights into astrophysical foregrounds. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISW–tSZ cross-correlations as a probe of dark energy dynamics, with the Thawing quintessence model yielding the lowest $\chi^2_{\rm min}$ among the tested scenarios, and highlight the need for future high-precision measurements to distinguish between quintessence models and $\Lambda$CDM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Single-Pulse Correlations in PSR B0329+54: Implications for Radio Emission Zones</a><span class="id">[2601.17299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Individual radio pulses from a pulsar are directly linked to the underlying emission processes and the associated magnetic field geometry within its magnetosphere. Thus, single-pulse studies across frequencies can provide crucial insights into the physics of radio emission. Multiple studies have investigated single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 with widely separated discrete frequencies, reporting the broadband nature of pulsar emission. However, understanding the frequency evolution of these correlations has been limited by poor frequency sampling, and the physical origin of these correlations remains unexplored. We present a detailed study of single-pulse correlations in PSR B0329+54 at low radio frequencies using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), with well-sampled time series spanning 300-1460 MHz. We derived an inverted flux spectrum for this pulsar, with a turnover near 470 MHz. We used flux-calibrated and scintillation-corrected single pulses to study correlations across frequencies. Our results show that maximum correlations consistently occur near the longitude of the central component, with correlation strength exceeding 69\% for all frequency combinations, while outer components exhibit correlations above 46\%. These findings indicate very strong inter-frequency correlations, with no anticorrelations detected. No cross-component correlations were observed; only corresponding components correlate across frequencies. The longitudes of maximum correlation do not coincide with the intensity peaks of the average profile. We also examine how correlations vary with frequency at selected fiducial longitudes. The observations reported in this work favor curvature radiation from relativistic charge bunches in the pulsar plasma; however, reproducing the correlation curves along with spectra remains an open challenge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the hadronic origin of the very high energy $γ$-ray emission surrounding the young massive stellar cluster Westerlund 1</a><span class="id">[2601.17324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Westerlund 1 (Wd 1) is the most massive known young star cluster in the Galaxy, and an extended $\gamma$-ray source HESS J1646-458 surrounding it has been detected up to 80 TeV in the very high energy, implying that cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated effectively in the region. However, the dominant radiation process contributing to the $\gamma$-ray emission is not well constrained. In the present work, we develop a model of CR acceleration at the termination shock in the superbubble inflated by the interaction of the cluster wind from the Wd 1 with the surrounding interstellar medium. We then calculate the flux and radial profile of $\gamma$ rays produced by the inelastic collisions of the hadronic CRs with the ambient gas. Our results with reasonable parameters can explain well the spectrum and radial profile of the $\gamma$-ray emission of HESS J1646-458, and consequently the $\gamma$-ray emission of HESS J1646-458 is likely to be of hadronic origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The optical photometric and spectroscopic periodicities of the cataclysmic variable SRGt 062340.2-265751</a><span class="id">[2601.17477]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on optical spectroscopic and photometric follow-up observations of the eROSITA discovered transient SRGt 062340.2-265751 and show that it displays the characteristics of a nova-like cataclysmic variable (CV), with possible indications of being a magnetic system. We try to put better constraints on the classification of SRGt 062340.2-265751 using optical time-resolved spectroscopic and photometric observations to find any periodicities in the system. From these periodicities we can classify the CV sub-type that it belongs to. Spectroscopic observations revealed a very low amplitude, K $\sim$ 14 km s$^{-1}$, in the radial velocity of the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission lines, suggesting that the system is likely observed at a low inclination angle. High-speed photometric observations revealed highly stochastic variability, characteristic of many magnetic cataclysmic variable systems. A probable 3.645 $\pm$ 0.006 hour orbital period was found by applying Lomb-Scargle period analysis to the H$\beta$ and H$\gamma$ emission line radial velocities. A 24.905 $\pm$ 0.065 min period was found from photometric observations, which we associate with the white dwarf spin. However, it was also found that the photometry revealed multiple periodicities from night to night. TESS observations in three sectors did not reveal any of the periodicities found from ground-based observations, but did show a prominent period in only one sector, which might be attributed to a positive superhump period. These multiple periodicities as well as the HeII $\lambda$4686 and Bowen blend emission lines seen in the spectra indicate that SRGt 062340.2-265751 is likely a nova-like CV, and might belong to the VY Scl sub-type.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Resolution Solar X-ray Spectroscopy from Archived Solar Maximum Mission Data</a><span class="id">[2601.17491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Archived high-resolution X-ray spectra in the 13 Å to 22 Å range from the Flat Crystal Spectrometer (FCS), an instrument on the Solar Maximum Mission operating in the 1980s, are analyzed with reference to nonflaring active regions, and to the \ion{Fe}{17} line emission in light of laboratory and atomic data for nearby \ion{Fe}{16} satellites. The satellites allow temperature to be found for these relatively low-temperature spectra, at which more conventional temperature-dependent line ratios are unavailable. By this means, the spectra can be arranged by temperature, showing that the \ion{Fe}{17} lines are evident at temperatures of $&lt;3$ MK. We confirm that the problem of the underintense Fe XVII 3C and 3D lines is not due to resonant scattering, and instead suggest that, for comparison with CHIANTI spectra, the problem may lie with a needed revision of collisional excitation rates. The line ratio 3G/3H is in theory density-dependent but for \ion{Fe}{17} the ratio is in the low-density limit. However, we suggest that spectra taken during the impulsive stage of flares might reveal a departure from this limit and so allow densities to be derived and hence properties of the flaring plasma. Suggestions for the design of future crystal spectrometers are made in the light of the fluorescence background in FCS spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deciphering the Remnants of Core-Collapse Supernovae: Reconstructing Progenitor Star Properties and Explosion Mechanisms</a><span class="id">[2601.17499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>(Abridged) Recent JWST observations of Cassiopeia A (Cas A) reveal unprecedented ejecta substructure, including a web of filaments and the enigmatic &quot;Green Monster&quot; (GM), characterized by nearly circular holes and rings. These features provide new constraints on supernova (SN) explosion physics and ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interactions. We present high-resolution three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a neutrino-driven SN explosion tailored to Cas A, following the system from core collapse to an age of $\sim 1000$ yr. The models include key physical processes such as hydrodynamic instabilities, Ni-bubble effects, radiative cooling, non-equilibrium ionization, and electron-ion temperature equilibration. Our results show that the filamentary ejecta network naturally forms during the early explosion due to the interaction of neutrino-driven bubbles and instabilities, retaining a memory of the initial conditions before being progressively modified by the reverse shock. The GM morphology is reproduced by the interaction of dense ejecta clumps with an asymmetric, forward-shocked CSM shell, with radiative cooling enhancing fragmentation and generating the observed holes and rings. Overall, our study demonstrates that Cas A's complex morphology reflects both the imprint of the explosion mechanism and subsequent ejecta-CSM interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of Stellar Activity and Habitable Zone II: Ca H&amp;K Emissions of Late-type Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2601.17715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar chromospheric activity serves as a valuable proxy for estimating stellar ages, though its applicable range and accurate functional form are still debated. In this study, utilizing the LAMOST spectra we compiled a catalog of open cluster members and field stars to investigate $R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$–age relations across various spectral types. We find that a linear model, specifically a Skumanich-type relation, can best describe the overall decline of chromospheric activity with age, with the slope varying across different spectral types. However, we also identify variations in the decay rate along the main sequence, which call for more accurate follow-up investigation. Finally, we find that lower-metallicity stars exhibit enhanced activity for F-, G-, and K-type stars, whereas no clear metallicity dependence is observed for M dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigmoid Formation, Filament Destabilization, and Initiation of Weak Flare by Tether-Cutting Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2601.17771]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have studied a B-class solar flare and an associated filament eruption through multi-wavelength observations. The flare triggers at 16:24 UT on June 7$^{th}$, 2017 from an active region (AR) 12661, and it maximizes at 16:54 UT. The magnetic flux cancellation occurs near the polarity inversion line (PIL) preceding the flare, and ultraviolet (UV) brightenings occur in the pre-flare phase at the flux cancellation sites, suggesting the reconnection occurs in the lower atmosphere, initially. The S-shaped sigmoid forms through successive steps in corona, i.e., small-scale brightenings, helical/twisted field lines, bright patches, and finally, a developed sigmoid. It justifies that runaway reconnection within the coronal arcades forms the sigmoid within the filament. The differential emission-measure (DEM) analysis reveals the existence of the plasma at a temperature of more than 10 MK within the sigmoid. The initial magnetic reconnection reorganizes the field overlying the filament as per the tether-cutting model. Therefore, it enables the filament to rise slowly, and around 16:41 UT, the eruption phase of the filament begins. The filament eruption removes the overlying coronal field, including the sigmoid. During the eruption phase, we have found intersecting/crossing of coronal loops and jet-like structures far away from the sigmoid-filament system. In conclusion, all the observational findings (e.g., magnetic flux convergence, cancellation, UV brightenings, and spatial and temporal correlation between formation/evolution of the sigmoid and rise/eruption of the filament) suggest that the formation of a solar flare and the eruption of the filament are consistent with the tether-cutting model of solar eruption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Energy shift of Fe-K fluorescence lines due to low ionization demonstrated with XRISM in Centaurus X-3</a><span class="id">[2601.17792]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescence line at 6.4 keV is a powerful probe of cold matter surrounding X-ray sources and has been widely used in various astrophysical contexts. The X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer onboard XRISM can measure line shifts with unprecedented precision of $\sim$0.2 eV, equivalent to a line-of-sight velocity of $\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$. At this level of accuracy, however, several factors that influence the line energy must be carefully considered prior to astrophysical interpretation. One such important factor is the ionization degree, Fe$^{q+}$. The K$\alpha$ line shifts redward by $\sim$4 eV as $q$ increases from 0 (neutral) to 8 (Ar-like). Additionally, the accompanying Fe K$\beta$ line at 7.06 keV shifts blueward by $\sim$30 eV from $q=0$ to 8. We demonstrate that this effect is actually observable in the XRISM data of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3 (Cen X-3). We advocate that the differential energy shift between the K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ line provides a robust estimate of $q$ by decoupling from other effects that shift the two lines in the same direction. We derived $q \sim 5$ (Sc-like) for the fluorescing matter by comparing the observation with atomic structure calculations of our own and in the literature. By accounting for the derived charge state and the corresponding shift in the rest-frame line energy, we made corrections for this effect and reached a consistent residual shift among the K$\alpha$, K$\beta$, and the optical measurement attributable to the systemic velocity of the system. Consequently, we obtained a new constraint on the location of the cold matter. This ionization effect needs to be assessed in all use cases of the Fe K$\alpha$ line shift beyond Cen X-3, and the proposed metric is generally applicable to all of them.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint constraint on the propagation origin of the cosmic-ray spectral knee from energy spectrum and anisotropy observations</a><span class="id">[2601.17851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin mechanism of the cosmic-ray knee region remains an unresolved mystery, with acceleration, interaction, and propagation models drawing significant attention. The latest experimental observations of the PeV total spectrum, composition energy spectrum, and anisotropy-particularly the precise measurements of the proton spectrum by the LHAASO experiment-have provided crucial breakthroughs in uncovering its origin. Based on the latest LHAASO measurements of the proton energy spectrum, combined with cosmic-ray spectral and anisotropy data, this study proposes that the spectral index variation in the knee region arises from changes in the propagation coefficient. By introducing a knee position $\rm \mathcal{R}_{knee}$ and an index variation $\rm \delta_{knee}$, we construct a rigidity-dependent double-power-law diffusion model to reproduce the knee-region spectral structure. Through modifications to the diffusion coefficient, we successfully replicate the observed knee-region spectral structure in the LHAASO proton spectrum and calculate the corresponding anisotropy. Under current data and model dependencies, a joint analysis of the energy spectrum and anisotropy does not support the propagation origin model of the cosmic-ray knee at a 95\% confidence level. We hope that future LHAASO experiments will provide precise measurements of the energy spectra and anisotropies of various nuclei in the knee region, thereby offering a definitive test of the propagation model as the origin mechanism of the knee-region spectral structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17874" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting the E_G measurements from the photometric and spectroscopic surveys of Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST)</a><span class="id">[2601.17874]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present forecasts for the $E_G$ statistic using redshift distributions of realistic mock galaxy samples from the upcoming Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST).

Our analysis shows that CSST will nevertheless achieve $E_G$ constraints at the few-percent level (3%-9%) over $0 &lt; z &lt; 1.2$, an improvement by a factor of several to an order of magnitude over current observations. Within the $\mu-\Sigma$ modified gravity framework, the parameter $\Sigma_0$, associated with the effective gravitational constant of the Weyl potential, can be constrained to $\sim 5\%$ precision. In a plausible scenario where upcoming spectroscopic surveys determine ${\beta}$ to 1\% accuracy, $E_G$ constraints tighten to the percent level, and $\Sigma_0$ becomes measurable at $\sim 1\%$. These results demonstrate that CSST will serve as a powerful facility for testing gravity and underscore the essential synergy between photometric weak lensing and spectroscopic surveys in probing cosmic acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three-point intrinsic alignments of galaxies and haloes in the FLAMINGO simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.17914]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Third-order statistics provide information beyond two-point measures, but extracting this information requires accurate and consistent modelling. We measure and detect the three-point correlation function and third-order aperture-mass statistics of intrinsic alignments (IA) for galaxies and for haloes with $M_{\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ in the $(2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ simulation volume of the FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulation suite. We model the third-order aperture-mass statistics and show that on large scales both the galaxy and halo samples are well described by the tree-level effective field theory (EFT) of IA across the three dark matter density-shape combinations and a wide range of triangle configurations, with the alignment amplitude consistent with that inferred from two-point statistics. We compare the full EFT to several other models: a version neglecting the velocity-shear term, the non-linear alignment model (NLA), and to a reduced EFT assuming co-evolution relations that follow from the assumption that alignment is linear in Lagrangian space. The first two models yield biased constraints on the alignment amplitude, but the reduced EFT performs remarkably well, achieving a low reduced chi-squared and minimal bias. We examine the redshift and mass dependence of the higher-order bias parameters, finding that the linear Lagrangian bias assumption is approximately satisfied across the explored halo mass and redshift ranges for both galaxies and haloes, suggesting that the galaxies broadly follow the alignment properties of their host haloes. These co-evolution relations can be valuable for photometric shear surveys, where limited constraining power on IA parameters favours models with fewer free parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</a><span class="id">[2601.17938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Evolution and Current Sheet Analysis as Probes of Reconnection-Mediated Decay in Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2601.17955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The decay of magnetically dominated turbulence exhibits robust inverse transfer of magnetic energy even in the absence of net magnetic helicity, challenging traditional cascade-based phenomenology. While recent studies suggest that magnetic reconnection governs the evolution of such systems, a comprehensive understanding has been lacking. Here we test a reconnection-mediated model for decaying magnetic turbulence in two-dimensional (strict-2D), 2.5D, and three-dimensional (3D) systems with both helical and nonhelical initial conditions. We show that the magnetic-energy decay timescale scales with the Lundquist number in a manner consistent with Sweet-Parker-type reconnection rather than Alfvenic or purely resistive timescales. We develop a broken power-law model for the magnetic energy spectra and provide analytic predictions for the temporal evolution of energy across both sub-inertial and inertial ranges, which are confirmed by high-resolution simulations. In nonhelical turbulence, these results favor anastrophy as the dominant constraint over helicity fluctuations. Using Minkowski functionals to analyze reconnecting current sheets in real space, we find that the structures controlling the decay are substantially smaller than the global magnetic correlation scale, implying local Lundquist numbers well below the system-scale value. This explains the weak sensitivity of global decay laws to current-sheet resolution and that the current-sheet aspect ratios converge toward Sweet-Parker predictions only at sufficiently high resolution. Together, these results establish magnetic reconnection as the organizing principle underlying inverse transfer, spectral evolution, and decay in magnetically dominated turbulence, providing a unified picture applicable across dimensionality and helicity regimes with direct implications for astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dependence of the asteroid rotation on their composition</a><span class="id">[2601.18002]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rotational properties of asteroids provide critical information about not only their internal structure but also their collisional and thermal histories. Previous work has revealed a bimodal distribution of asteroid spin rates, dividing populations into fast and slow rotators, but to date this separation remains poorly understood (e.g. its dependency on composition). We investigate whether the valley separating fast and slow rotators in rotational period-diameter space depends on the composition of the asteroid, approximated by asteroids' spectral class. First, we extended the Minor Planet Physical Properties Catalogue (MP3C) to include the available spectral classes of asteroids. Then, for each asteroid we selected the best diameter, rotational period, and spectral class. Building upon a semi-supervised machine-learning method, we quantify the valley between fast and slow rotators for S- and C-complex asteroids, which are linked to ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites respectively. The method iteratively fits a linear boundary between the two populations in rotational period-diameter space to maximise their separation. We find a clear compositional dependence of the valley: for C-complex asteroids the transition occurs at longer periods than for S-complex, with P* = 14.4 D_km^0.739 (C-complex) and P* = 11.6 D_km^0.718 (S-complex), where period and diameter are given in hours and kilometres respectively. This corresponds to mu Q approximately 2 and 13 GPa, respectively, where mu is the rigidity and Q the quality factor. The dependence of the valley on spectral classes likely reflects compositional and structural differences: C-complex asteroids, being more porous and weaker, dissipate angular momentum more efficiently than stronger, more coherent S-complex asteroids. This represents quantitative evidence of class-dependent rotational valleys within asteroid populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18051" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino opacities in magnetic fields for binary neutron star merger simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.18051]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrino interactions play a central role in transport and flavor evolution in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers.

We aim to study the planetesimal formation via the SI, driven by the stellar X-ray photoevaporation during the late stages of disk dispersal, and quantify its dependence on key disk and stellar parameters. We use the DustPy code to simulate the dust dynamics including coagulation, fragmentation, and radial drift in a viscously accreting disk undergoing stellar X-ray photoevaporation. Stellar X-rays drive the disk dispersal, opening a cavity at a few au orbital distance and inducing the formation of an associated local pressure maximum. This pressure maximum acts as a trap for radially drifting dust, therefore enhancing the dust density to the critical level required to initiate the streaming instability and the subsequent collapse into planetesimals. The fiducial model produces 31.4 M_\oplus of planetesimals with an initial dust to final planetesimal conversion efficiency of 20.4%. This pathway is most efficient in larger disks with higher metallicities, lower viscosities, higher dust fragmentation threshold velocities, and/or around stars with higher X-ray luminosities. This work demonstrates that stellar X-ray photoevaporation is a robust and feasible mechanism for triggering planetesimal formation via the SI during the final clearing phase of protoplanetary disk evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring photospheric horizontal flows from multiple observations with SUVEL models</a><span class="id">[2601.18183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photospheric horizontal velocity fields play essential roles in the formation and evolution of numerous solar activities. Various methods for estimating the horizontal velocity field have been proposed in the past. Aiming at the highest available (and future) spatial resolution (10 km/pixel) observations, a new method the Shallow U-net models (SUVEL) based on realistic numerical simulation and machine learning techniques was recently developed to track the photospheric horizontal velocity fields. Although SUVEL has been tested on numerical simulation data, its performance on solar observational data remained unclear. In this work, we apply SUVEL to the photospheric intensity observations from four ground-based solar telescopes (DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST) with the largest available apertures, and compare the results obtained from SUVEL with the Fourier local correlation tracking method (FLCT). Average correlation indices between granular regions and velocity fields inferred by SUVEL (FLCT) are 0.63, 0.81, 0.80, and 0.87 (0.00, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.10) for DKIST, GST, NVST, and SST observations. Higher correlation indices between the velocity fields tracked by SUVEL and granular patterns than FLCT reveal the superior performance of SUVEL, validating its reliability with respect to solar observational data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Mass Loss at the End of TP-AGB stars</a><span class="id">[2601.18194]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase plays a key role in the evolution of low- to intermediate-mass stars, driving mass loss that influences their final stages and contributes to galactic chemical enrichment. However, the mechanisms behind mass loss, particularly at the end of AGB, are still not well understood. We aim to investigate the relationship between stellar parameters and envelope dynamics during the TP-AGB phase, evaluating whether dynamical instabilities in the envelope can act as a possible mass-loss mechanism. We use hydrodynamics method in MESA to simulate the dynamical pulsations and resulting mass loss during the TP-AGB phase of a star evolved from a 1.5 Msun zero-age main sequence. Our simulations reproduce the dynamical pulsation behavior of stars during the TP-AGB phase, demonstrating that the envelope mass is a key factor governing pulsational properties. As the envelope mass decreases, both the pulsation period and radial amplitude increase, consistent with observational trends. For 1.5 Msun model, once the envelope mass declines to approximately 0.25 Msun, the model enters a regime of violent pulsations, potentially ejecting the remaining envelope within a few hundred years. We suggest that the instability can act as the dominant mass-loss mechanism in the end of the TP-AGB phase, marking a rapid transitional stage toward the post-AGB phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18324" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible favored Great Oxidation Event scenario on exoplanets around M-Stars with the example of TRAPPIST-1e</a><span class="id">[2601.18324]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Great Oxidation Event (GOE), which marked the transition from an anoxic to an oxygenated atmosphere, occurred 2.4 billion years ago on Earth, several hundreds of millions of years after the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis. This long delay implies that specific conditions in terms of biomass productivity and burial were necessary to trigger the GOE. It could be a limiting factor for the development of oxygenated atmospheres on inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we explore the specificities of a terrestrial planet in the habitable zone of an M dwarf for a GOE. Using a 1D coupled photochemical-climate model, we simulate the atmospheric evolution of TRAPPIST-1 e, an Earth-like exoplanet, exploring the effect of oxygen sources (biotic or abiotic). Our results show that the stellar energy distribution promotes O3 production at lower O2 concentrations compared to Earth, and the ozone layer on TRAPPIST-1 e forms more efficiently. This lowers the threshold for atmospheric oxidation, suggesting that the GOE on TRAPPIST-1 e would occur quickly after the rise of oxygenic photosynthesis, up to 1Gyrs earlier than on Earth, and would reach O2 enabling oxygenic respiration and thus the development of animals. We may question whether this is a general behavior around several M-stars. Furthermore, we discuss how the overproduction of ozone could make O3 detection possible using the James Webb Space Telescope, providing a potential method to observe oxygenation signatures on exoplanets in the near future. Previous studies predicted that for an Earth-like atmosphere O3 would require over 150 transits for detection, but our results show that significantly fewer transits could be needed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolution Dependence in Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Neutrino-Driven Core-Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.18357]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the role of resolution and initial magnetic field strength on core-collapse supernovae in simulations of a non-rotating $13 \mathrm{M_\odot}$ progenitor. Specifically, we study the effect on shock revival, explosion dynamics, and the properties of the compact remnant. We run four models with different numerical grid resolutions with an initial central dipole field strength of $\mathord{\approx}10^{12}\, \mathrm{G}$. Two of those resolutions are also run with a weaker central magnetic field of $\mathord{\approx}10^{10}\, \mathrm{G}$ . The shock revival time for all models is largely independent of resolution and initial magnetic field strength, but we find higher explosion energies when the initial magnetism is stronger and at higher resolutions. We find that models with strong magnetic fields have lower neutrino luminosity and energies, due to a proto-neutron star (PNS) that is deformed by the strong magnetic fields. At higher resolutions, magnetic fields are amplified more efficiently in the gain region and in the PNS via the small-scale dynamo. Although the strong magnetic fields do not directly drive the explosion, they have a subsidiary impact on the explosion mechanism and compensate for the reduced neutrino heating. Stronger magnetic energies in the PNS also affect energy and angular momentum redistribution, leading to more extended and vigorous PNS convection zones at higher resolutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the role of accretion shocks in galaxy clusters as sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays</a><span class="id">[2601.18411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the Pierre Auger Observatory has found strong evidence supporting the extragalactic origin of the most energetic cosmic rays. Despite several observed excesses in the distribution of arrival directions for the highest energy cosmic rays, the sources remain unidentified. Accretion shocks in galaxy clusters have been proposed as potential sources in the past. These immense shock waves, which can have radii on the order of megaparsecs, are generated by the infall of material from the intergalactic medium into the gravitational potential wells of galaxy clusters. In this work, we investigate the possibility that ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are accelerated in these regions. Nearby massive galaxy clusters, including Virgo, are treated as a discrete component of the cluster mass distribution. Less massive galaxy clusters, as well as distant massive ones, are assumed to follow a continuous distribution in agreement with cluster mass statistics. We fit the flux at Earth and the composition profile measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, assuming the injection of different nuclear species by these sources, to determine the values of the model parameters. Our results indicate that cosmic ray acceleration in cluster accretion shocks may account for at least a fraction of the observed UHECR flux at energies below the suppression scale. At higher energies, direct acceleration from the thermal pool would be feasible only if local fluctuations create favorable conditions, such as magnetic fields about an order of magnitude stronger than those typically expected in cluster accretion shocks, or for particular shock normal-magnetic field configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Observational Evidence for Split Infall Flow of Cosmic Filaments into Clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.18434]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Velocity fields in the cosmic web are fundamental to structure formation but remain difficult to observe directly beyond the linear regime. Here we present observational evidence that galaxy filaments connecting pairs of galaxy clusters undergo a split infall, with opposite velocity flows toward the two clusters. Using spectroscopic galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we isolate the internal filament velocity field by subtracting its rigid-body background motion and Hubble flow, and detect this effect at greater than $5\sigma$ significance across a wide range of cluster and filament selections. The measured velocity profile exhibits a sign reversal near the filament midpoint and a maximum infall amplitude of $\sim30$ km/s ($\sim20$ km/s projected onto the line-of-sight) for clusters of mass $\sim10^{14.3}M_\odot$, substantially lower than expected for infall from an average cosmic environment. Multiple results on density-velocity correlation, mass-dependency, and validation with simulation indicate that filaments dynamically respond to competing gravitational potentials rather than acting as passive mass transport channels. Our results establish a new observational window on quasi-linear velocity fields in the cosmic web and provide a promising probe of mass measurement, testing gravity and velocity reconstruction with upcoming wide-field spectroscopic surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18553" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Different Transient Phenomena at the Edges of Traveling Foreshocks</a><span class="id">[2601.18553]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Past kinetic simulations and spacecraft observations have shown that traveling foreshocks (TFs) are bounded by either foreshock compressional boundaries (FCBs) or foreshock bubbles (FBs). Here we present four TFs with a different kind of structure appearing at one of their edges. Two of them, observed by the Cluster mission, are bounded by a hot flow anomaly (HFA). In one case, the HFA was observed only by the spacecraft closest to the bow shock, while the other three probes observed an FCB. In addition, two other TFs were observed by the MMS spacecraft to be delimited by a structure that we call HFA-like FCB. In the spacecraft data, these structures present signatures similar to those of HFAs: dips in magnetic field magnitude and solar wind density, decelerated and deflected plasma flow and increased temperature. However, a detailed inspection of these events reveals the absence of heating of the SW beam. Instead, the beam almost disappears inside these events and the plasma moments are strongly influenced by the suprathermal particles. We suggest that HFA-like FCBs are related to the evolution and structure of the directional discontinuities of the interplanetary magnetic field whose thickness is larger than the gyroradious of suprathermal ions. We also show that individual TFs may appear together with several different types of transient upstream mesoscale structures, which brings up a question about their combined effect on regions downstream of the bow shock.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio streaks in the Lighthouse Nebula discovered with MeerKAT – Particles escaping from the tail and illuminating the ambient magnetic field</a><span class="id">[2601.18596]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bow-shock pulsar wind nebulae are valuable sources to investigate the dynamics of relativistic pulsar winds and the mechanisms by which they are converted into cosmic-ray leptons at the highest energies. The Lighthouse Nebula is one such object, famous for the high velocity of its pulsar and a long misaligned X-ray jet that is understood as a specific escape channel for the most energetic particles. We aim to get a better understanding of how the bulk of non-thermal particles are released into the interstellar medium. We focus on GHz radio observations, which probe lower-energy particles that are dominant in number and long-lived, thus offering a picture of how escape proceeds in the long run. We analyze 10.5h of MeerKAT observations in the 0.9-1.7GHz band. MeerKAT observations reveal a highly structured synchrotron nebula downstream of pulsar PSR J1101-6101. A cometary tail is detected up to beyond 5pc from the pulsar, while a system of multiple transverse two-sided emission streaks is observed for the first time. No radio counterpart of the misaligned X-ray jet is seen. The radio streaks are interpreted as the occasional charge-independent release of energetic leptons from the tail into the surrounding medium, as a result of dynamical instabilities and reconfiguration in the downstream flow. The intensity layout suggests that most of the particle content of the nebula is discharged into the ambient medium within several parsec. Once escaped, particles light up the ambient magnetic field, which appears to have a coherence length of at least a few parsec. The length and persistence of the streaks indicate a low level of magnetic turbulence, possibly slightly enhanced with respect to average cosmic-ray transport conditions in the Galaxy. Such a confinement may result from self-generated turbulence by resonant streaming instability, or be due to past activity of the progenitor star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric Circulation of High-Obliquity Mini-Neptunes</a><span class="id">[2601.18606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the operation of JWST, atmospheric characterization has now extended to low-mass exoplanets. In compact multiplanetary systems, secular spin-orbital resonance may preserve high obliquities and asynchronous rotation even for tidally-despinning, low-mass planets, potentially leading to unique atmospheric circulation patterns. To understand the impact on the atmospheric circulation and to identify the potential atmospheric observational signatures of such high-obliquity planets, we simulate the three dimensional circulation of a representative mini-Neptune K2-290 b, whose obliquity may reach about 67 degrees. Whether synchronously rotating or not, the planet's slow rotation, moderate temperature and radius result in a global Weak-Temperature-Gradient (WTG) behavior with moderate horizontal temperature contrasts. Under synchronous rotation, broad eastward superrotating jets efficiently redistribute heat. Circulation in an asynchronous rotation exhibits a seasonal cycle driven by high obliquity, along with quasi-periodic oscillations in winds and temperatures with a period of about 70 orbital periods. These oscillations, driven by wave-mean flow interactions, extend from low to mid-latitudes due to the slow planetary rotation. Higher atmospheric metallicity strengthens radiative forcing, increasing temperature contrasts and jet speeds. Clouds have minimal impact under synchronous rotation but weaken jets under nonsynchronous rotation by reducing temperature contrasts. In all cases, both thermal emission and transmission spectra exhibit moderate observational signals at a level of 100 ppm, and high-obliquity effects contribute differences at the 10 ppm level. Our results are also applicable to a range of potential high-obliquity exoplanets, which reside in the WTG regime and likely exhibit nearly homogeneous horizontal temperature patterns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk-jet-wind coupling from stellar mass to supermassive black holes</a><span class="id">[2601.18607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black holes are the simplest possible objects, characterised by only mass and spin.

This dramatic spectral change also affects the expected properties of thermal and radiatively powered winds, matching the overall properties of winds seen in new XRISM data from the stellar mass binaries, though there can also be additional UV and dust driven winds in supermassive black holes. The radio data in stellar and supermassive black holes are clear that the hot flow (not the disc) connects to the radio jet, and the radio-X-ray 'fundamental plane' can be qualitatively understood if the radio quiet AGN and stellar mass black holes have low to moderate spins, with the jet power set as a constant fraction of the accretion power. A small fraction of AGN (radio loud) instead have much higher (factor $100-1000\times$) radio-to-X-ray ratio at the same black hole mass and mass accretion rates. I speculate that these have higher jet power due to high black hole spin. I review the multiple issues still remaining in this picture, most of which are connected to the geometry and nature of the X-ray corona, and the conflicting constraints on this which come from reflection spectroscopy and polarimetry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Reionization Morphology and Source Properties with 21cm-Galaxy Cross-Correlation Surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.18627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cross-correlations between 21cm observations and galaxy surveys provide a powerful probe of reionization by reducing foreground sensitivity while linking ionization morphology to galaxies.

Interaction with the turbulent background plasma is key to the acceleration of many types of energetic particles including high-energy cosmic rays, solar energetic particles, and pick-up ions. This is a process that would ideally be described by a kinetic model, a type of model that follows a probability distribution function (PDF) for all particles in 7-dimensional space. Because of the high dimensionality of a kinetic model, such simulations use the largest computational resources available, and are yet unable to simulate a realistic number of particles, reach the large scales necessary for astrophysical problems, or use high-precision numerical methods. Two available alternatives to kinetic plasma models have been explored: a multi-fluid model, and a hybrid fluid/Fokker-Planck model. These methods are hampered by the physical modeling of the coupling. We develop a new model, which follows the PDF for all particles; this can be viewed as a step toward physical realism above a multi-fluid MHD model, while also being more computationally efficient than a kinetic model. The equations we develop model both the background plasma and the energetic particles self-consistently. Over the last decade, similar PDF methods have been developed to a high level of sophistication to model reactive flows and turbulent combustion for engineering applications. For treatment of the feedback of the energetic particles on a background plasma, a PDF closure approach should evaluate the mean characteristics, including the density, with better statistical quality than will particle-sampling procedures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Rastall gravity on hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.18652]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters are the largest virialized structures in the Universe and are predominantly dominated by dark matter.

In this work, we derive the hydrostatic mass of galaxy clusters within the framework of Rastall gravity and investigate its implications under two scenarios: (i) the absence of dark matter and (ii) the existence of dark matter. In the first scenario, Rastall gravity effectively reduces the hydrostatic mass, bringing it closer to the observed baryonic mass. The best linear fit yields a slope $\mathbf{M}=1.07\pm0.11$, indicating a near one-to-one correspondence between the two masses. In the second scenario, Rastall gravity helps to alleviate the hydrostatic mass bias. The linear fit between the Rastall hydrostatic mass and the observed lensing mass results in a best-fit slope $\mathbf{M}=1.01\pm0.16$, which is very close to unity.

In particular, for PBH masses following the critical collapse mass-scaling law with critical exponent $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, with $\gamma_\mathrm{crit} \in (0.33, 0.49)$, the aforementioned radiative absorption mass growth mechanism produces a striking effect: PBHs forming with a mass $10^6M_\odot$ during BBN can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{10} M_\odot)$ within $\mathcal{O}(10^{6} \mathrm{s})$ ($\sim $ 58 days). Interestingly enough, small deviations from $\gamma_\mathrm{crit}$, depending itself on the number of relativistic species present in the primordial plasma, yield a continuous PBH mass spectrum providing us ultimately with a single, Standard-Model-based explanation for the origin of stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), and naturally accounting for the early appearance of SMBHs. The Schwarzschild treatment presented here can be extended to spherically symmetric cosmological black holes, indicating that radiative absorption is a dominant and previously overlooked PBH growth channel in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explaining the thermal emission of old neutron stars with rotochemical heating and magnetized superconducting protons</a><span class="id">[2601.18725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of likely thermal ultraviolet emission from a few old neutron stars suggests that at least one internal heating mechanism is present in these stars. One proposed mechanism is rotochemical heating, in which the continuous contraction of the neutron star due to its spin-down produces chemical imbalances that induce Urca reactions, and the latter deposit heat in the neutron star core. If the protons in the star are superconducting, their energy gap suppresses the reactions, except in microscopic magnetized regions (such as quantized flux tubes) in which the protons act as if they were normal. Therefore, the strength of the internal magnetic field controls the rate at which reactions proceed and thus affects the thermal evolution of the neutron star. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the effect of an internal magnetic field in the superconducting interior on rotochemical heating. We simulate the evolution of neutron stars for different internal magnetic field strengths and neutron energy gaps, comparing the results to Hubble Space Telescope observations of old neutron stars. All the observational data can be accounted for if the proton energy gap is large ($\sim 1.5\,\mathrm{MeV}$) and the neutron energy gap is small ($\lesssim 0.1\,\mathrm{MeV}$) or vanishing, while the millisecond pulsar PSR J0437$-$4715 needs to have a very weak internal magnetic field. Our results suggest that neutron-star cores are characterized by a large proton pairing gap and a small or vanishing neutron gap, and that millisecond pulsars have very weak internal magnetic fields. Under these conditions, rotochemical heating alone can account for the observed thermal emission of old neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Intrinsic Temperature and Vertical Mixing in Characterizing Sub-Neptune Atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2601.18769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sub-Neptune planets are often modeled with a dense rocky or metal-rich interior beneath a thick hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmosphere; though their bulk densities could also be explained by a water-rich interior with a thin H/He atmosphere. Atmospheric composition provides a key mechanism to break this degeneracy between competing interior models. However, the overall composition of sub-Neptunes inferred from spectra obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope, remains debated in part due to differences in modeling assumptions. While previous studies explored parameter spaces such as stellar spectra, atmospheric metallicities, and carbon-to-oxygen ratios, they often assumed fixed intrinsic temperatures (Tint) and vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (Kzz) - two critical, yet poorly constrained, drivers of atmospheric chemistry. To address this, we present a self-consistent grid of models that covers the full plausible range of Tint (60 - 450 K) and Kzz (10^{5} - 10^{12} cm^2/s) using the open-source PICASO and VULCAN packages to better characterize sub-Neptune atmospheres. Focusing on K2-18b analogs, we demonstrate that Tint and Kzz significantly impact CH4, CO2, CO, NH3 and HCN abundances, with H2O being largely unaffected. Our work demonstrates that comprehensive parameter space exploration of thermal and mixing parameters is essential for accurate interpretation of sub-Neptune spectra, and that single-parameter assumptions can lead to misclassification of planetary interiors. We provide a diagnostic framework using multi-molecule observations to distinguish between competing atmospheric models and advance robust characterization of sub-Neptunes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Col-OSSOS: Investigating the Origins of Different Surfaces in the Primordial Kuiper Belt</a><span class="id">[2601.18776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Colours of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (Col-OSSOS) measured the optical/NIR colours of a brightness-complete sample of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). Like previous surveys, this one found a bimodal colour distribution in TNOs, categorised as red and very red. Additionally, this survey proposed an alternative surface classification scheme: FaintIR and BrightIR. Cold classical TNOs mostly have very red or FaintIR surfaces, while dynamically excited TNOs show a mixture of surfaces. This likely indicates that formation locations and proximity to the Sun influenced surface characteristics and color changes. Our study combines the data from Col-OSSOS with two dynamical models describing the formation of the Kuiper belt during Neptune's migration. We investigate the proposed surface-colour changing line and explore the distribution of different surfaces within the primordial disk. By comparing radial colour transitions across various scenarios, we explore the origins of surface characteristics and their implications within the context of BrightIR and FaintIR classifications. Moreover, we extend our analysis to examine the distribution of these surface classes within the present-day Kuiper Belt, providing insights into the configuration of the early solar system's planetesimal disk prior to giant planet migration. We find that the most likely primordial disk compositions are inner neutral / outer red (with transition $30.0^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au), or inner BrightIR / outer FaintIR (with transition $31.5^{+1.1}_{-1.2}$ au).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baryonification III: An accurate analytical model for the dispersion measure probability density function of fast radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.18784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a fully analytical framework for predicting the one-point probability distribution function (PDF) of dispersion measures (DM) for fast radio bursts (FRBs) using the baryonification (BFC) model. BFC provides a computationally efficient alternative to expensive hydrodynamical simulations for modelling baryonic effects on cosmological scales. By applying the halo mass function and halo bias, we convolve contributions from individual halos across a range of masses and redshifts to derive the large-scale structure contribution to the DM PDF. We validate our analytical predictions against consistency-check simulations and compare them with the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation across a range of redshifts up to $z = 5$, demonstrating excellent agreement. We demonstrate that our model produces consistent results when fitting gas profiles and predicting the PDF, and vice versa. We show that the BFC parameters controlling the gas profile, particularly the halo mass scale ($M_\mathrm{c}$), mass-dependent slope ($\mu$), and outer truncation ($\delta$), are the primary drivers of the PDF shape. Additionally, we investigate the validity of the log-normal approximation commonly used for DM distributions, finding that it provides a sufficient description for a few hundred FRBs. Our work provides a self-consistent model that links gas density profiles to integrated DM statistics, enabling future constraints on baryonic feedback processes from FRB observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18131" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sub-ion scale current sheets in kinetic Alfvén wave turbulence</a><span class="id">[2601.18131]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>3D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are performed using the kinetic Alfvén wave (KAW) eigenvector relations from a two-fluid model as initial conditions, in order to study turbulent fluctuations and intermittent structures at sub-ion and electron scales. Simulations with different ion-to-electron mass ratios are set up to investigate the role of electron scales in the formation of intermittent structures. We analyze the current sheet structures that develop in these simulations. Two algorithms, namely Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), are employed to determine the thickness, length, and width of the current sheets, and both methods are found to yield consistent results. The average current sheet thickness scales inversely with the square root of the ion-to-electron mass ratio, with values close to the electron skin depth ($d_e$), indicating the presence of electron-scale current sheets in the simulations. The widths and lengths of the current sheets show a weaker scaling with the mass ratio. The scale-dependent kurtosis reveals enhanced intermittency at electron scales, consistent with magnetosheath observations. Distributions of scale-dependent properties of the current sheets also align with the electron skin depth of the different simulations and they lie within ranges observed in kinetic scale solar wind turbulence. This study reveals the nature of sub-ion-scale current sheets in KAW turbulence and their role in dissipation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Role of the symmetry energy on hybrid stars</a><span class="id">[2601.18752]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The impact of the symmetry energy on the properties of compact stars is analyzed considering constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysics.

Theoretical predictions are confronted with multimessenger constraints from heavy pulsars, NICER radius measurements, and GW170817 tidal deformability, imposing $M_{\max}\simeq 2.07\, M_{\odot}$ and $10.62~\mathrm{km}&lt;R_{1.4}&lt;12.83~\mathrm{km}$ to constrain both the EOS parameter space and $\lambda$. We find that density-dependent EOSs such as DDH$_\delta$ and TW satisfy all observational constraints for specific $\lambda$ ranges, while nonlinear EOSs (NL3, GM1, TM1), despite large maximum masses, fail to simultaneously satisfy radius and tidal bounds even in modified gravity. The maximum neutron star mass is highly sensitive to the matter–geometry coupling and exhibits a strong degeneracy with the EOS, consistent with previous studies. The additional term in the modified Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff equations alters the pressure gradient, affecting EOS stiffness and the speed of sound squared $c_s^2$, while preserving causality ($c_s^2/c^2&lt;1$). Pearson and Kendall analyses reveal a strong negative correlation between mass, radius, and $\lambda$ ($-0.18$ and $-0.23$, respectively).

In this work, we explore the potential of localized Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) as a novel tool to constrain the cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_k$ in a cosmological model-independent way. Using a sample of 120 FRBs with known redshifts and dispersion measures, we reconstruct the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ via artificial neural networks, and use it to obtain angular-diameter distances $D_A(z)$ through two complementary approaches. First, we derive the comoving distance $D_C(z)$ and $D_A(z)$ directly from FRBs without assuming a fiducial cosmology. Then, we combine the FRB-based $H(z)$ with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) DESI DR2 measurements to infer $D_A(z)$. By comparing the FRB-derived and BAO+FRB-derived $D_A(z)$, we constrain spatial curvature. Our covariance-based likelihood (accounting for correlated uncertainties) yields $\Omega_k = -0.31\pm0.57$, while a diagonal (Gaussian) treatment gives $\Omega_k = -0.13\pm0.46$. Both estimations are consistent with spatial flatness at the $1\sigma$ level, albeit with a mild preference for negative curvature. Explicitly accounting for the full covariance broadens the intervals and avoids underestimation of uncertainties. These results highlight the growing relevance of FRBs in precision cosmology and their synergy with BAO as a powerful, cosmological model-independent probe of the large-scale geometry of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The environment of TeV halo progenitors</a><span class="id">[2507.01495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TeV haloes are extended sources of very-high-energy gamma rays found around some middle-aged pulsars. The emission spanning several tens of parsecs suggests an efficient confinement of the ultra-relativistic lepton pairs produced by pulsars in their vicinity. The physical mechanism responsible for this suppressed transport has not yet been identified. In some scenarios, pair confinement may be linked to the medium the pulsars are located in. We aim at understanding the type of medium pulsars probe over their lifetime. We developed a model for the environment probed by moving pulsars, from their birth in core-collapse explosions - where they receive a natal kick - until their entry into the interstellar medium. The model involves: (i) a Monte-Carlo sampling of the properties of the massive-star progenitors of pulsars; (ii) a calculation of the structure of the surrounding medium shaped by these progenitors for the two cases of isolated stars and star clusters; and (iii) a computation of the evolution of supernova remnants in these parent environments. Ultimately, from a distribution of neutron star kick velocities, we assess the medium in which pulsars are located as a function of time. We first derived the statistical properties of a fully synthetic Galactic population and then applied the model to a selection of known pulsars to assess the likely nature of their environment. We show that pulsars escape into the interstellar medium at around 300 kyr, significantly later than assumed in the literature. Given our assumptions, all known pulsars with a confirmed TeV halo have high probabilities of still being in their parent environment, which suggests that efficient pair confinement is connected to the region influenced by progenitor stars. To test this, we provide the probability that known pulsars still reside in their parent environment for a list of known pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmographic constraints from late-time probes including fast radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2507.06975]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we use late-time probes, such as well-localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), supernovae (SNe), and cosmic chronometers (CC) to constrain cosmological parameters through a model-independent cosmographic approach.

The cosmographic approach with FRBs alone provides $H_0 = 66.35^{+4.13}_{-5.04} \, \text{km} \, \text{s}^{-1} \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $q_0 = -0.33^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$, and $j_0 = 0.83^{+0.57}_{-0.67}$, corresponding to a precision of $\sim 6\%$ for the Hubble constant and showing consistency with the $\Lambda$CDM expectation.

This process requires an accurate lensing tracer, which can be obtained either through internal reconstruction from high-resolution CMB observations or from external large-scale structure (LSS) surveys. Ground-based large-aperture telescopes (LATs) are crucial for internal reconstruction, yet existing and planned facilities are confined to the southern hemisphere, limiting effective delensing to that region. In this work, we assess the impact of introducing a northern hemisphere LAT, assumed to be situated near AliCPT (hence termed Ali-like LAT, or LATN), on delensing performance and PGW detection, using simulations. Our baseline setup includes a space-based small-aperture mission (LiteBIRD-like, SAT) and a southern LAT (SO-like, LATS). External LSS tracers, which have been shown to play an important role in delensing before the availability of ultra-sensitive polarization data, are also considered. We find that southern-hemisphere internal delensing reduces the uncertainty in r by approximately 21% compared to the no-delensing case. Adding LATN enables full-sky internal delensing, achieving a further  19% reduction–comparable to that from including LSS tracers ( 17%). Once LATN is included, the marginal benefit of LSS tracers drops to  10%. These results highlight the significant role of LATN in advancing delensing capabilities and improving PGW constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: DR6 Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Selected Galaxy Clusters Catalog</a><span class="id">[2507.21459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of a search for galaxy clusters in the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) Data Release 6 (DR6) microwave sky maps covering 16293 square degrees in three frequency bands, using data obtained over the lifetime of the project (2008-2022).

We detect deviations from bulk (composite) variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proton-rich production of lanthanides: the $νi$ process</a><span class="id">[2510.11467]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The astrophysical origin of the lanthanides is an open question in nuclear astrophysics.

Previous kinetic studies by particle-in-cell simulations have demonstrated that when maximum CR energy is near the injection scale, NRH instability efficiently amplifies magnetic field up to the saturation level. However, the efficiency of NRH instability goes down as maximum energy increase since CR current is carried by escaping CRs near the maximum energy. We employ a one-dimensional MHD–CR framework solving telegraph-type diffusion–convection equations to trace the coupled evolution of CRs, magnetic fields, and shock dynamics under realistic parameters. We find a distinct transition with magnetic field strength: for weak background fields ($B_{0}\!\lesssim\!10^{-4}\,\mathrm{G}$), NRH instability efficiently amplifies upstream turbulence, driving a self-regulated state where $E_{\max}$ becomes independent of initial strength of magnetic turbulence. In contrast, for stronger background fields ($B_{0}\!\gtrsim\!10^{-3}\,\mathrm{G}$), the escaping CR current is too weak to drive NRH instability, and magnetic turbulence further decays through parametric instabilities, potentially reducing the acceleration efficiency. We give the physical interpretation for the transition and discuss conditions for PeV–EeV acceleration at UFO reverse shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A in a High Density Environment</a><span class="id">[2510.19132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Einstein Probe, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+3\times 10^4$ s (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0 \sim 5\times 10^4$ s, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a collapsar environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytical approximations for curved primordial tensor spectra</a><span class="id">[2511.10644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We build upon previous analytical treatments of scalar perturbations in curved inflationary universes to obtain analytical templates for the primordial tensor power spectrum in models with non-zero primordial spatial curvature. These templates are derived without assuming a particular inflaton potential, within a background history consisting of an initial kinetically dominated phase followed by an ultra-slow-roll inflationary regime, thereby isolating the universal imprints of curvature on tensor modes. Our results predict characteristic large-scale features – including low-$\ell$ cut-offs and oscillatory patterns – that are consistent with numerical solutions and provide a clear physical interpretation of how curvature modifies the underlying dynamics. In particular, we show that curvature effects manifest mathematically as systematic shifts in the dynamically relevant wavevectors, mirroring the behaviour previously identified in the scalar power spectrum. These features translate into distinctive signatures in the large-angle $B$-mode polarisation spectrum, offering a potential discriminant for spatial curvature in forthcoming CMB observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: growth rate measurements from the maximum likelihood fields method</a><span class="id">[2512.03229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the constraint on the growth rate of structure from the combination of DESI DR1 BGS sample, Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher peculiar velocity catalogues using the maximum likelihood fields method.

Previous studies of directly imaged Earth-like planets have mainly examined the signatures of atmospheric composition, often using 1D models, while the effect of horizontal temperature gradients has received limited attention. Because a pronounced horizontal temperature gradient may signal the absence of a global ocean, we investigate its detectability through thermal-emission direct imaging. Adopting Teegarden's Star b (zero-albedo equilibrium temperature  280 K) as a benchmark, we compute 3D atmospheric structures with and without a global ocean using the ROCKE-3D general circulation model and simulate geometry-dependent thermal emission spectra. We show that the temperature gradients that disfavor a global-ocean scenario manifest in both orbital phase variation and spectral shape of the snapshot spectra. The phase variation is more readily detectable: one-day integrations with LIFE at two orbital phases would reveal flux variations in no-ocean cases with 1-10 bar atmospheres, depending on background atmospheric composition. Shapshot spectra provide complementary diagnostics, including the running brightness temperature of the continuum and detailed absorption band shapes, but detecting these features requires longer integration times. These 3D effects, if neglected, can bias interpretations based on 1D models, and could also lead to misidentification of the H$_2$O band beyond 10 $\mu$m. We also assess the detectability of these 3D effects on other nearby planets. Our results highlight the need to incorporate 3D atmospheric structures when characterizing rocky exoplanets, both to constrain surface conditions and to avoid misinterpretation of spectral data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</a><span class="id">[2512.17705]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse.

We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of $2.14~\mathrm{dex}$ on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of $4.78~\mathrm{dex}$. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models.

We challenge this viewpoint by analyzing 88 Sound Horizon Free $H_0$ measurements, categorized into four classes: Distance Ladder measurements using local calibrators; Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements assuming the standard expansion history; Pure Local measurements independent of $H(z)$ shape; and CMB Sound–Horizon–Free measurements using CMB data without the Sound Horizon scale. Our analysis reveals that the 30 Distance Ladder measurements yield $H_0 = 72.73 \pm 0.39$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.72$), while the 58 Distance Ladder-Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements collectively yield $H_0 = 69.37 \pm 0.34$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ ($\chi^2_\nu = 0.95$), a $6.5\sigma$ tension exceeding the Planck–SH0ES discrepancy. This tension remains significant at a minimum value of $3.9\sigma$ after accounting for correlations. Among categories, Local $\Lambda$CDM measurements favor the lowest value ($H_0 = 67.61\pm 0.96$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), Pure Local yield an intermediate value ($H_0 = 71.03 \pm 0.69$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$), and CMB Sound Horizon Free measurements give $H_0 = 69.07 \pm 0.44$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conclude that the Hubble tension is better characterized as a discrepancy between the Distance Ladder and all other methodologies, rather than an early-vs-late-time split. We also identify a $2.9\sigma$ internal tension among Distance Ladder Independent/Sound Horizon Free measurements: analyses assuming $\Lambda$CDM systematically recover lower $H_0$ values compared to cosmological-model-independent methods. This suggests either unrecognized systematics in the Distance Ladder or deviations from $\Lambda$CDM or both.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Search for Joint Sources of Gravitational Waves and High-Energy Neutrinos with IceCube During the Third Observing Run of LIGO and Virgo</a><span class="id">[2601.07595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of joint sources of high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves has been a primary target for the LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and IceCube observatories.

It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modelled via an $\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia20fnr: A binary-lens microlensing event with full orbital motion revealed by four space telescopes</a><span class="id">[2601.15969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The microlensing event Gaia20fnr is a long-duration, non-caustic-crossing binary-lens event at high Galactic latitude. Triggered by a photometric rise detected by the Gaia space mission, the event was followed up with observations from multiple ground-based facilities and four space telescopes: Gaia, NEOWISE, Swift, and TESS. We characterize the Gaia20fnr microlensing system by determining the physical and orbital properties of the binary lens, the nature of the luminous source, and the kinematics of both the source and the lens. We employed a binary-lens microlensing model including full Keplerian orbital motion and annual microlens parallax to fit the photometric data. The event is best explained by a K2 giant source at $D_{\rm S} = 3.10 \pm 0.10\,\mathrm{kpc}$ lensed by a stellar binary composed of $M_{\rm L,1} = 0.46 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm L,2} = 0.52 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L} = 0.54 \pm 0.05\,\mathrm{kpc}$. The light curve exhibits strong signatures of orbital motion and requires a full Keplerian model with a period of $P = 0.67 \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{yr}$ and a radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $K_1 = 16.9 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Gaia20fnr is one of the few microlensing events for which a complete Keplerian binary-lens solution has been derived. The model can be tested with follow-up radial-velocity and high-resolution imaging observations as well as forthcoming Gaia DR4 and DR5 astrometric time-series data. Its long duration, multi-peak structure, and extensive coverage make it a benchmark for studying faint nearby low-mass binaries through microlensing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eccentricity evolution of spinning binaries and its dependence on the equation of state of the components</a><span class="id">[2306.12522]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the evolution of the eccentricity of an eccentric orbit with spinning components. We develop a prescription to express the evolving eccentricity in terms of reference eccentricity and frequency. For that purpose we considered the spins to be perpendicular to the orbital plane. Using this we found an analytical result for the contribution of spin in eccentricity evolution. As a result, we expressed orbital eccentricity in a series of reference eccentricity and gravitational wave frequency. The prescription developed here can easily be used to find arbitrarily higher-order contributions of reference eccentricity. With this we computed the eccentricity upto $\mathcal{O}(e_0^5)$. This result can be used to construct the waveforms of spinning compact objects in an eccentric orbit. Since, our expression depends on the spin induced quadrupole moments, we also study the impact of component properties on the eccentricity evolution through the quadrupole moment. We find for BNSs the evolution depends on the equation of state very mildly unless the NSs are subsolar mass. For subsolar mass NSs the deviations from BH case is comparatively larger and has equation of state dependence. For binary boson stars the deviations are comparatively larger across the mass values. We argue that it may affect our understanding of formation channels and their corresponding populations.

We demonstrate that the breakdown of the &quot;frozen-in&quot; condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the mean magnetic field. Unlike stochastic turbulence models, this framework predicts a coherent, explosive onset of resistivity that naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. We support this thesis with renormalization group theory and a novel analysis of Magnetospheric Multiscale mission data, which reveals an explosive phase space confinement consistent with collective phase slippage rather than chaotic scattering. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stimulated radiation from superradiant scalar cloud in scalar-tensor theory</a><span class="id">[2601.11988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scalar-tensor theories predict fundamental scalar fields of considerable interest in astrophysics and cosmology. We investigate the superradiant instability of scalar clouds around Kerr black holes, showing that stimulated decay generates detectable electromagnetic signals. The growth of the superradiant scalar cloud differs from that of other bosonic fields and depends sensitively on the matter distribution surrounding the black hole, which originates from the scalar-matter coupling realized by the chameleon mechanism in modified gravity theories. In non-uniform matter distributions, stimulated emission from scalar clouds offers an observational signature that distinguishes fundamental scalars from other light bosonic fields.</p></div></details></article></body>
