The conference brought together more than 60 researchers from around the world, united by an interest in using radio wavelength observations to explore the physical processes that operate in stars (including the Sun), how stars evolve and interact with their environments, and the role of radio stars as probes of our Galaxy. Topics discussed at the meeting included radio emission from cool and ultracool dwarfs, extrasolar space weather, stellar masers, thermal radio emission from evolved stars, circumstellar chemistry, low frequency observations of the Sun, radio emission from hot stars, applications of very long baseline interferometry techniques to stellar astrophysics, stellar explosive events, the detection of radio stars in the latest generation of widefield sky surveys, the importance of radio stars for understanding the structure and evolution of the Milky Way, and the anticipated applications for stellar astrophysics of future radio observatories on the ground and in space. This article summarizes research topics and results featured at the conference, along with some background and contextual information. It also highlights key outstanding questions in stellar astrophysics where new insights are anticipated from the next generation of observational facilities operating at meter through submillimeter wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling Obscured Accretion in the Local Universe</a><span class="id">[2509.21532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), especially Compton-thick sources with line-of-sight column density ($N_{\rm H,los}$) $&gt;$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$, are critical to understanding supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth and the origin of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). However, their observed fraction remains significantly below model predictions, due to strong absorption bias, even in the hard X-ray (i.e., above 10 keV) band. We analyze a sample of 26 nearby ($z &lt; 0.1$) AGN from the Swift-BAT 150-month catalog, selected via mid-IR to X-ray diagnostics and observed with NuSTAR and soft X-ray telescopes (Xmm-Newton, Chandra, or Swift-xrt). Using self-consistent torus models (MyTorus, Borus02, and UXCLUMPY), we aim to constrain $N_{\rm H,los}$, the average torus column density, and other geometrical parameters of the obscuring medium. A comparative analysis among the three torus models showed that while estimates of $N_{\rm{H,los}}$ were generally in agreement, Borus02 tended to classify a slightly larger number of sources as Compton-thick AGN (CT-AGN). Building on this comparison, we benchmark two prediction schemes – a mid-IR/X-ray relation and a machine-learning model – against our broadband best-fit $N_{\rm H,los}$ measurements to assess which approach more effectively bridges the gap between predicted and measured obscuration, finding that while the former works effectively in the heavily obscured region (log$\rm{N_H} \gtrsim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$), the latter provides improved accuracy, particularly for Compton-thin to moderately thick regimes (log$\rm{N_H} \lesssim$ 23.5 $\rm{cm^{-2}}$).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlackTHUNDER: evidence for three massive black holes in a z 5 galaxy</a><span class="id">[2509.21575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observational evidence for three massive, accreting black holes in the $z=5.0167$ galaxy J0148-4214 from JWST/NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy. The black holes are revealed through broad H$\alpha$ emission (FWHM = 430-2920 km/s) without a forbidden-line counterpart in the bright [O III] doublet. Channel maps of the asymmetric central H$\alpha$ profile isolate two spatially distinct broad line regions (BLRs), separated by $190\pm40$ pc, while a third BLR is found in the galaxy outskirts with a projected separation of 1.7 kpc. Using single-epoch virial relations, we estimate black hole masses of $\log(M_\bullet/M_\odot)=7.9\pm0.4$ (primary central), $5.8\pm0.5$ (secondary central) and $6.3\pm0.5$ (third off-nuclear). We argue that the two central black holes will likely rapidly merge, with a simple dynamical friction time estimate of the order of 700 Myr. Assuming that also the off-nuclear black hole is in the process of sinking towards the centre, it will likely lead to a second merger, and we investigate the detection probability of such mergers with LISA. Alternatively, the third black hole may be the result of previous three-body interaction or a gravitational recoil, where our observations would provide evidence that such black holes may retain their accretion discs and BLRs even in the aftermath of such extreme dynamical interactions. The discovery of a black hole triplet at high redshift, together with other recent results on distant black hole pairs, indicates that multiple massive black hole systems were common in the early Universe. Our results highlight the importance of IFU observations for the detection of massive black hole multiplets in distant galaxies, the progenitors of massive black hole mergers that may be detected with next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A nearly pristine star from the Large Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2509.21643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The first stars formed out of pristine gas, causing them to be so massive that none are expected to have survived until today. If their direct descendants were sufficiently low-mass stars, they could exist today and would be recognizable by having the lowest metallicity (abundance of elements heavier than helium). The lowest metallicity star currently known is a star in the thick disk of the Milky Way with total metallicity Z &lt; 1.4 x 10^-6 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.0). While other stars with lower iron abundance have been discovered, they have high carbon abundances and thus higher total metallicities (log Z/Zsun &gt; -3). Here we present the discovery and detailed chemical analysis of the most metal-poor star yet found: the red giant star SDSS J0715-7334 with ultra-low abundances of both iron and carbon ([Fe/H]=-4.3, [C/Fe]&lt;-0.2), resulting in total metallicity Z &lt; 7.8 x 10^-7 (log Z/Zsun &lt; -4.3). This star has the most pristine composition of any object known in the universe. The star's orbit indicates that it originates from the halo of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Its detailed chemical composition implies a supernova progenitor with initial mass of 30 solar masses. Current models of low-mass star formation can explain the existence of SDSS J0715-7334 only if dust cooling was already able to operate at the time of its formation. SDSS J0715-7334 is over ten times more metal-poor than the most metal-poor high-redshift galaxies found by the James Webb Space Telescope, some of which have been claimed to be potentially metal-free. Substantially deeper observations of high-redshift galaxies would be needed to prove that they are truly pristine galaxies made of metal-free stars and not metal-enriched galaxies composed of second-generation stars like SDSS J0715-7334.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BICEP/Keck XX: Component-separated maps of polarized CMB and thermal dust emission using Planck and BICEP/Keck Observations through the 2018 Observing Season</a><span class="id">[2509.21648]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present component-separated polarization maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Galactic thermal dust emission, derived using data from the BICEP/Keck experiments through the 2018 observing season and Planck. By employing a maximum-likelihood method that utilizes observing matrices, we produce unbiased maps of the CMB and dust signals. We outline the computational challenges and demonstrate an efficient implementation of the component map estimator. We show methods to compute and characterize power spectra of these maps, opening up an alternative way to infer the tensor-to-scalar ratio from our data. We compare the results of this map-based separation method with the baseline BICEP/Keck analysis. Our analysis demonstrates consistency between the two methods, finding an 84% correlation between the pipelines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First results from ALPPS: a sub-Alfvénic streamer in SVS13A</a><span class="id">[2509.21701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first results from the ALMA Perseus Polarization Survey (ALPPS), focusing on the magnetic field in the SVS13A circumbinary disk. The dataset includes full-Stokes dust continuum observations at $\sim0\farcs3$ and 870 $\mu$m, as well as molecular line emission from C$^{17}$O$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs3$, C$^{18}$O$(J=2 \rightarrow 1)$ at $\sim0\farcs2$, and DCN$(J=3 \rightarrow 2)$ at $\sim0\farcs1$ angular resolution. Our observations resolve both a previously identified dust spiral and an infalling streamer, capturing their spatial and kinematic structures. The streamer is traced from scales $&gt;300$ au down to the circumbinary disk. Using alignment measure (AM) maps and histograms that compare the orientations of the plane-of-sky magnetic field with local intensity and velocity gradients, we find that the AM distribution peaks at a value of 1. This AM peak strongly suggests alignment between the field and the dust total intensity emission, as well as between the field and the gas velocity, which in turn suggests grain alignment by magnetic fields. From our data, we derive a magnetic field strength, B$_{\mathrm{pos}} \sim 1.1 \pm 0.6$ mG, and a kinetic to magnetic energy ratio of $0.5 \pm 0.4$, suggesting magnetic dominance. We also produced a map of the Alfvénic Mach number, finding $\mathcal{M}_{\rm A} &lt; 1$ along the streamer, consistent with sub-Alfvénic infalling motions. Therefore, the field is likely facilitating the inflow of material from the envelope onto the disk by constraining movement across the field lines. This represents the first detection of a magnetically sub-Alfvénic infalling streamer in a protostellar system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping CO Ice in a Star-Forming Filament in the 3 kpc Arm with JWST</a><span class="id">[2509.21763]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CO gas emission is a fundamental tool for measuring column density, but in cold, dark clouds, much of the CO is locked away in ice. We present JWST results from observations of a star forming filament (G0.342+0.024) that that appears to be associated with the 3 kpc arm. This filament is backlit by the Galactic Center, which has allowed us to construct a high-resolution extinction map (mean separation between stars of  1&quot; outside the filament,  2&quot; in the filament). ALMA Band 3 data reveals embedded star formation within the cloud. Using the CO ice feature covered by the F466N band, we map the CO ice column density of the filament. By combining the extinction map, CO ice column density map, and archival CO observations, we examine the efficacy of standard CO X-factor measurements of mass in star forming this http URL find that 50-88% of the CO is locked away in ice at large column densities ($N_{\rm \rm H_2} \gtrsim 10^{22} \rm ~cm^{-2}, 200 \rm ~M_{\odot} \rm ~pc^{-2}$) in the filament. The primary sources of uncertainty in this estimate are due to uncertainty in the ice composition and lab measurements of ice opacities. This shows that systematic corrections are needed for mass measurements in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies at high column densities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helium-burning blue large-amplitude pulsators: A Population Study with BPASS</a><span class="id">[2509.21784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blue Large-Amplitude Pulsators (BLAPs) are a class of radially pulsating stars with effective temperatures ranging from 20,000 to 35,000 K and pulsation periods between 7 and 75 minutes. This study utilizes the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis (BPASS) code to investigate helium-burning stars as a formation channel for BLAPs in the Milky Way. The progenitor stars have initial masses of 3-6 $M_{\odot}$, resulting in BLAPs with final masses of 0.5-1.2 $M_{\odot}$. Based on a constant star formation rate of 3 $ M_{\odot}\text{yr}^{-1}$ and solar metallicity (Z = 0.020), population synthesis predicts approximately 14,351 helium-burning BLAPs in the Milky Way: 12,799 with Main Sequence (MS) companions and 1,551 with evolved/compact-object companions. Helium-burning BLAPs show prolonged lifetimes in the pulsation region and a narrow stellar age range for entering this regime (log(t/yr) = 8.0-8.6), unlike pre-white dwarf models. BLAPs with MS companions typically form via Roche lobe overflow, leading to longer orbital periods ($\sim$100 days). Those with evolved/compact-object companions form through common envelope evolution, resulting in shorter periods. While Galactic extinction makes most BLAPs faint (apparent magnitudes $&gt;$ 25), future surveys like WFST and VRO LSST are expected to detect approximately 500-900. This research establishes helium-burning stars as a significant BLAP contributor and offers testable predictions regarding their binary properties and Galactic distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Draco Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy in the First Year of DESI Data</a><span class="id">[2509.21822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the spatial distribution, kinematics, and metallicity of stars in the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy using data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We identify 155 high probability members of Draco using line of sight velocity and metallicity information derived from DESI spectroscopy along with {\it Gaia} DR3 proper motions. We find a mean line of sight velocity of $ -290.62\pm0.80$ km s$^{-1}$ with dispersion = $9.57^{+0.66}_{-0.62}$ km s$^{-1}$ and mean metallicity $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ = $-2.10\pm0.04$, consistent with previous results. We also find that Draco has a steep metallicity gradient within the half-light radius, and a metallicity gradient that flattens beyond the half-light radius. We identify eight high probability members outside the King tidal radius, four of which we identify for the first time. These extra-tidal stars are not preferentially aligned along the orbit of Draco. We compute an average surface brightness of 34.02 mag $\rm arcsec^{-2}$ within an elliptical annulus from the King tidal radius of 48.1 arcmin to 81 arcmin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21852" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The EDGE-CALIFA Survey: Influence of Mergers on Radial Profiles of Star-Formation Properties</a><span class="id">[2509.21852]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate how the merging process influences the radial variations of the specific Star Formation Rate (sSFR), Star Formation Efficiency (SFE), and molecular gas fraction (fmol ) in galaxies. We analyse 33 isolated galaxies and 34 galaxies in four different merger stages from pairs, merging galaxies, post-mergers, and merger remnants. Our sample is included in the EDGE-CALIFA survey, which provides spatially resolved optical integral-field unit and CO spectroscopy data. We show that, in comparison with the isolated sample, the mergers increase the molecular gas fraction non-uniformly across different galactocentric distances. Also, we find that the main driver (efficiency or molecular gas) of both enhanced and suppressed star formation changes independently of galactocentric radius and merger stage. However, efficiency appears to be the primary driver of variations in star formation (except during the merging stage), where we find an enhancement in star formation driven by the available fuel. Our results suggest that in interacting and merging galaxies, the efficiency plays a crucial role in the star formation variations throughout the galaxy, regardless of the available molecular gas content.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21855" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT): A Nearly Unbiased Approach to Constraining Optical Variability Dependence on Physical Properties of Active Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2509.21855]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) exhibit stochastic optical variability, commonly characterized by a damped random walk. The damping timescale is of particular interest because it is related to fundamental properties of the central black hole, such as its mass and accretion rate. However, the systematic underestimation of damping timescales caused by limited observational baselines makes it difficult to exhaustively utilize all available data. Many previous efforts have relied on strict selection criteria to avoid biased measurements, and such criteria inevitably constrain the range of AGN physical parameter space and therefore hinder robust inference of the underlying dependencies of damping timescale on AGN properties. In contrast, we introduce a novel forward modeling approach, Baseline-Aware Dependence fitting for DAmping Timescales (BADDAT), which explicitly accounts for these biases and leverages the information contained in underestimated timescale measurements. Rather than attempting to correct individual timescale measurements, BADDAT robustly constrains the population-level dependence of damping timescale on AGN physical properties. We demonstrate its effectiveness using mock light curves and show that it successfully reconciles previous inconsistent results based on two independent AGN samples. Our BADDAT method will have broad applications in AGN variability studies during the era of time-domain astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modified Cosmology or Modified Galaxy Astrophysics is Driving the z&gt;6 JWST Results? CMB Experiments can discover the Origin in Near Future</a><span class="id">[2509.21952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The massive and bright galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at high redshifts ($z &gt; 6$) have challenged our understanding of the Universe. This may require revisiting the physics of galaxy formation and evolution, or modifying the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model to explain these observations, or both. We show that high-resolution CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (or CMB-S4) can measure smoking-gun signatures jointly in weak lensing and kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) power spectra, which can shed light on both these scenarios. An increase in the matter power spectrum at small scales will enhance the number density of dark matter halos at high redshifts, thereby increasing the galaxy formation rate. This will cause enhanced weak lensing signal from these redshifts and also lead to enhanced patchy-kSZ signal from the epoch of reionization. However, if only galaxy astrophysics is modified, without any modification in the matter power spectrum, then the patchy-kSZ signal gets altered, while the weak lensing signal remains nearly unaltered. We show that we can measure the modified astrophysical and cosmological scenarios at a statistical significance of $6.2\sigma$ (and $17.4\sigma$) from Simons Observatory (and CMB-S4), which will enable a conclusive understanding on what physical process is driving the high-redshift observations of JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fermi detection of $γ$-rays from the radio-quiet Seyfert galaxy NGC 3281</a><span class="id">[2509.21958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the detection of significant $\gamma$-ray emission with $\it Fermi$-LAT from the radio-quiet Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 3281, with a luminosity of $5.9\,(\pm 1.7)\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ at a significance of $6.22\,\sigma$ (TS = $42.81$). The power-law photon index is $2.61~(\pm 0.24)$, indicative of a soft spectrum. The star formation activity in NGC 3281 is insufficient to explain its $\gamma$-ray luminosity based on the empirical relation between the infrared and $\gamma$-ray luminosities observed in other sources. The multiwavelength spectrum can be explained as due to inverse Compton scattering by relativistic electrons in the corona or jet of seed photons from the corona, disk and torus. The source is Compton-thick and attenuation of GeV photons due to pair production in the corona is nonnegligible (with an optical depth of about 10). The intrinsic $\gamma$-ray luminosity is inferred to be $3.4\,\times10^{42}$ and $2.2\,\times10^{41}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ for the corona and jet model, respectively. The observed $\gamma$-ray and radio luminosities is roughly consistent with the known correlation between the two quantities, among the lowest luminosity regime. The jet origin is valid only if the radio emission is dominated by the jet.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of gas in the Magellanic Bridge: MeerKAT detection of HI 21-cm absorption</a><span class="id">[2509.21970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>HI 21-cm absorption lines are investigated to determine the origin of the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) of the Magellanic Bridge (MB). Using the MeerKat Absorption Line Survey (MALS) data we report the detection of an HI absorption line at a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 10 caused by MB gas against the radio source J033242.97-724904.5. In combination with earlier data obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) our new detected HI line permits the exploration of the MB atomic hydrogen gas across 4-6 kpc. The radial velocity profiles from the ATCA data and new data from MALS are analysed. Apart from the excitation conditions, the radial velocity structure of the HI gas seen in emission and absorption is investigated. Eventually the gas-to-dust ratio is quantified to identify the origin of the MB gas being either from the SMC (Small Magellanic Cloud) or the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). The HI absorption lines towards lines of sight separated by several kpc consistently coincide with the densest and perhaps coolest gas at the lower radial-velocity limit of the corresponding HI emission profiles. The gas-to-dust ratio is found to be consistent with an origin of the MB gas from the LMC. The large scale velocity distribution as seen from the HI absorption features favors the LMC-SMC direct collision scenario over the close fly-by scenario, as also currently found by numerical simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass stratification in the globular cluster system revealing the assembly history of the nearest S0 galaxy NGC 3115</a><span class="id">[2509.21975]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy formation and evolution is hierarchical. The most massive galaxies are thought to form their central regions early through violent dissipational processes, then grow inside-out by accreting smaller satellites. While widely supported, direct observational confirmation of this process in individual galaxies remains lacking, except for the Milky Way. We present a detailed analysis of globular cluster (GC) candidates within a $70^\prime$ ($\sim190$ kpc) radius around the nearest S0 galaxy, NGC 3115, using images in \textit{g,r,z} bands from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and data from Gaia. We report the discovery of mass stratification in the GC system (GCS), evident in two ways: first, the effective radius of the GCS increases monotonically from the bright to faint end, up to the detection limit near the turnover magnitude of the GC luminosity function (GCLF); second, the GCLF shows fainter turnover magnitudes and smaller standard deviations at larger galactocentric radii. This stratification cannot be readily explained by radial migration or tidal dissolution, but most likely reflects the hierarchical assembly of NGC 3115's stellar halo, with later-accreted satellites deposited across broader galactocentric distances. This interpretation is supported by cosmological simulations of subhalos with comparable mass and bulge-to-total mass ratios and is consistent with the negative color gradients observed in the GCS. Additionally, we identify several substructures within the GCS, indicating ongoing assembly of NGC 3115. This work highlights the power of GCS as tracers of galaxy assembly and sets the stage for upcoming space-based wide-field imaging surveys to constrain the assembly of massive galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-redshift Merger-induced Bar-like Galaxies in IllustrisTNG</a><span class="id">[2509.22083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent discoveries made with JWST observations include a significant number of barred galaxies at high redshift. Their origin remains unclear and their presence seems difficult to reproduce in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. In this Letter I present four examples of high-redshift bars selected from a sample of bar-like galaxies studied previously using IllustrisTNG simulations. All the galaxies formed their bars at redshifts z &gt; 3 via mergers with smaller satellites, although one had its bar formed even earlier, at z &gt; 5. The bars were born long, with lengths on the order of 3 kpc, and grew in time. Three of the four galaxies were later accreted by clusters and underwent multiple interactions with their respective brightest cluster galaxies. Their bar strength was to some extent affected by these interactions but all the galaxies preserved their bar-like shape until the present time. By the end of the evolution, all the galaxies lost their gas and stopped forming stars, they retained essentially no disk component and were no longer rotationally supported. The examples demonstrate that high-z bars do not evolve into present-day barred disk galaxies similar to the Milky Way but rather into S0s or ellipticals typically found in galaxy clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric Redshift Forecast for 7-Dimensional Sky Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.22165]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the expected accuracy of redshifts that can be obtained using low-resolution spectroscopic (medium-band) data from the 7-Dimensional Sky Survey (7DS). By leveraging 40 densely sampled filters with widths of full width at half maximum (FWHM) = 25 nm, we create 7DS mock catalogs and estimate the redshift accuracy for three 7DS main surveys: Wide-field Time-Domain Survey (WTS), Intensive Monitoring Survey (IMS), and Reference Image Survey (RIS). Using photometric redshifts calculated from EAZY, we find that the five-year WTS provides reliable photometric redshifts with an normalized median absolute deviation (${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$) ranging from 0.003 to 0.007 and a catastrophic failure fraction ({\eta}) from 0.8% to 8.1% at $19 \leq m_{625}$ &lt; 22$. The spectral resolution R ~ 50 of the medium-band dataset effectively captures the 4000 Å break and various emission lines. We also explore the synergy with data obtained from Pan-STARRS1, VIKING, and SPHEREx surveys. Combining the SPHEREx all-sky data with WTS significantly improves the accuracy of photometric redshift estimates, achieving {\eta} = 0.4% and ${\sigma}_{\text{NMAD}}$ = 0.004 for fainter sources at higher redshifts. The additional near-IR information provided by SPHEREx and VIKING plays an essential role in resolving degeneracies between low and high redshifts. We also observe color excesses by subtracting adjacent broad-band data, which improves the confinement of photometric redshifts and aids in the detection of strong emission line galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of cosmic filaments on the abundance of satellite galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.22179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The impact of cosmic web environments on galaxy properties plays a critical role in understanding galaxy formation. Using the state-of-the-art cosmological simulation IllustrisTNG, we investigate how satellite galaxy abundance differs between filaments and the field, with filaments identified using the DisPerSE algorithm. When filaments are identified using galaxies as tracers, we find that, across all magnitude bins, central galaxies in filaments tend to host more satellite galaxies than their counterparts in the field, in qualitative agreement with observational results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The average ratios between satellite luminosity functions in filaments and the field are $3.49$, $2.61$, and $1.90$ in the central galaxy $r$-band magnitude bins of $M_{r, {\rm cen}} \sim -22$, $-21$, and $-20$, respectively. We show that much of this excess can be attributed to the higher host halo masses of galaxies in filaments. After resampling central galaxies in both environments to match the halo mass distributions within each magnitude bin, the satellite abundance enhancement in filaments is reduced by up to $79 \%$. Additionally, the choice of tracers used to identify filaments introduces a significant bias: when filaments are identified using the dark matter density field, the environmental difference in satellite abundance is reduced by more than $70 \%$; after further resampling in both magnitude and halo mass, the difference is further suppressed by another $\sim 60$–$95 \%$. Our results highlight the importance of halo mass differences and tracer choice biases when interpreting and understanding the impact of environment on satellite galaxy properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating solid-state CH3OH formation with chemical modelling</a><span class="id">[2509.22203]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Recent Monte Carlo simulations and laboratory studies of interstellar ices have proposed an alternative pathway involving the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction reaction in the overall mechanism of methanol (CH3OH) formation in dark molecular clouds. Aims. A computational study was conducted to investigate the contribution of the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route in CH3OH formation in interstellar ices, both in non-shocked and shocked environments, and to examine how the physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM) affect the overall CH3OH synthesis pathway. Methods. A set of chemical models were ran using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM to systematically explore methanol synthesis in various physical scenarios, including non-shock and low- and high-velocity C-shocks. Results. This work demonstrated for the first time that, under non-shock and shocked-influenced environments, the primary reaction leading to the formation of methanol in the inner layers of interstellar ices is indeed the radical-molecule H-atom abstraction route. However, such route is dependent on the gas kinetic temperature (Tk), gas volume density (nH2 ), velocity of the C-shock wave (vshock), and cosmic ray ionisation rate ({\zeta}). Furthermore, gaseous formaldehyde may trace C-type shocks and serve to differentiate methanol formation pathways in low-velocity C-shocked environments, as its abundance varies more significantly than that of CH3OH with the inclusion of the H-atom abstraction reaction in UCLCHEM. The H2CO/CH3OH ratio thus represents a potential diagnostic tool for this purpose.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Zoo: Cosmic Dawn – morphological classifications for over 41,000 galaxies in the Euclid Deep Field North from the Hawaii Two-0 Cosmic Dawn survey</a><span class="id">[2509.22311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present morphological classifications of over 41,000 galaxies out to $z_{\rm phot}\sim2.5$ across six square degrees of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDFN) from the Hawaii Twenty Square Degree (H20) survey, a part of the wider Cosmic Dawn survey. Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists play a crucial role in the examination of large astronomical data sets through crowdsourced data mining of extragalactic imaging.

Here, we present the details and general analysis of this iteration, including the use of Zoobot in an active learning cycle to improve both model performance and volunteer experience, as well as the discovery of 51 new gravitational lenses in the EDFN. We also announce the public data release of the classifications for over 45,000 subjects, including more than 41,000 galaxies (median $z_{\rm phot}$ of $0.42\pm0.23$), along with their associated image cutouts. This data set provides a valuable opportunity for follow-up imaging of objects in the EDFN as well as acting as a truth set for training deep learning models for application to ground-based surveys like that of the newly operational Vera C.

First, because these populations are where they are readily found and because, according to canonical stellar evolution models for isolated stars, these are the only populations where RR Lyrae should exist. Recent independent results, however, are challenging this view and pointing at the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae, only a few (2–5) Gyrs old. Our goal in this work is to provide direct evidence of the existence of intermediate-age RR Lyrae by searching for these stars in Milky Way open clusters, where the age association will be direct and robust. We searched over 3,000 open clusters with published kinematically associated member stars from the Hunt &amp; Reffert database by crossmatching against a compilation of the largest publicly available RR Lyrae surveys (\Gaia, ASAS-SN, PanStarrs1, Zwicky Transient Factory and OGLE-IV). We identified a star as a bona fide RR Lyrae variable and robust member of the 2–4 Gyr old Trumpler 5 cluster, based on its parallax and proper motions and their agreement with confirmed cluster members. We derived an extremely low probability ($0.049\pm 0.013$%) that the star is a background field RR Lyrae and provide initial constraints on a possible binary companion based on its position in the colour-absolute magnitude diagram. Currently a source of debate, the Trumpler 5 RR Lyrae provides the most direct evidence to date of the existence of RR Lyrae stars at much younger ages than traditionally expected and adds to the mounting evidence supporting their existence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22370" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Corannulene with ALMA: Observations of the Red Rectangle Nebula</a><span class="id">[2509.22370]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) are organic molecules responsible for the Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs), observed across a multitude of astrophysical environments. Despite their ubiquity, the precise formation mechanisms of PAHs remain unclear. One of the possible way for PAHs to form is in the outflows of evolved stars, such as HD 44179, which produces the Red Rectangle nebula - a known emitter of AIBs. However, no specific PAH molecules have been detected in such environments, complicating the understanding of PAH formation and evolution. This study aimed to detect the PAH molecule corannulene C20H10, a viable candidate for radio detection due to its large dipole moment of 2.07D. We analyzed high-resolution band 4 ALMA observations of the Red Rectangle nebula, collected over almost 9 hrs. Although corannulene emission was not detected, we estimated a firm upper limit on its abundance compared to hydrogen (5x10^-13) and we discuss the lack of detection in the context of our current understanding of PAH formation and destruction mechanisms. Additionally, we report tentative detection of signals at 139.612 GHz, 139.617 GHz, and 139.621 GHz, potentially originating from cyclopropenyledine c-C3H2 and the 140 GHz H2O maser.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Diamond Ring in Cygnus X: Advanced stage of an expanding bubble of ionised carbon</a><span class="id">[2509.22427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The &quot;Diamond Ring&quot; in Cygnus X, southwest of the DR21 ridge, is a nearly circular structure of $\sim$6 pc in diameter, prominent in FIR emission and enclosed by clumpy molecular clouds traced in CO. It hosts an HII region, visible in cm emission, and resembles a classical expanding HII bubble routinely seen in the 158 $\mu$m [CII] line. However, SOFIA FEEDBACK observations in the spectrally resolved [CII] line reveal instead a slightly tilted ring of $\sim$10$^3$ M$_\odot$ expanding slowly at $\sim$1.3 km s$^{-1}$, with a bulk line-of-sight (LOS) velocity near $-2$ km s$^{-1}$. The central &quot;Diamond&quot; is an unrelated dense clump at $\sim$7 km s$^{-1}$. The driving source, classified from IR spectroscopy, is a B0.5e star that powers the HII region. Unlike typical 3D shells, this marks the first case where we detect only a slowly expanding CII ring. We suggest the HII region and CII bubble, initially formed by a massive star, expanded outward from a flat slab of molecular gas nearly in the plane of the sky. The ring is now confined by swept-up material of the slab, while shell components moving perpendicular to the LOS have dissipated, leading to a reduction in expansion. Dedicated simulations tracing the evolution of the CII bubble support this geometry, consistent with previous reports of HII region evolution in flat molecular clouds. We propose that the &quot;Diamond Ring&quot; represents the terminal phase of an expanding CII bubble driven by stellar winds and thermal pressure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSS-C4 3028: The Nearest Blue Galaxy Cluster Devoid of an Intracluster Medium</a><span class="id">[2509.22523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SDSS-C4 3028 is a galaxy cluster at $z=0.061$, notable for its unusually high fraction of star-forming galaxies with 19 star-forming and 11 quiescent spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies. From Subaru/HSC imaging, we derived a weak lensing mass of $M_{200} = (1.3 \pm 0.9) \times 10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, indicating a low-mass cluster. This is in excellent agreement with its dynamical mass of $M_{200} = (1.0\pm0.4)\times10^{14} \rm M_\odot$, derived from SDSS spectroscopic data. XMM-Newton observations reveal that its X-ray emission is uniform and fully consistent with the astrophysical X-ray background, with no evidence for an intracluster medium (ICM). The 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $L_{\rm X}(0.1-2.4\rm keV)=7.7\times10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ on the cluster's X-ray luminosity falls below the value expected from the $L_{\rm X}-M_{\rm halo}$ scaling relation of nearby galaxy clusters. We derived star-formation histories for its member galaxies using the photometric spectral energy distribution from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE data. Most of its quiescent galaxies reside within the central 300 kpc, while star-forming ones dominate the outer region (300 kpc - 1 Mpc). The core region has formed the bulk of its stellar mass approximately 1.5 Gyr earlier than the outskirts. We infer a long quenching time of $&gt;3$ Gyr for its quiescent galaxies, consistent with slow quenching mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interaction or strangulation. These findings suggest that SDSS-C4 3028 may have undergone an &quot;inside-out&quot; formation and quenching process. Its ICM may have been expelled by intense AGN feedback after core formation but before full cluster assembly. The high fraction ($\sim$0.63) of star-forming members likely results from the absence of ram pressure stripping in this blue cluster, supporting the important role of ram pressure stripping in quenching galaxies in clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tomographic Distance Measurements to the Smith Cloud with SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper3</a><span class="id">[2509.22555]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High velocity clouds supply the Milky Way with gas that sustains star formation over cosmic timescales. Precise distance measurements are therefore essential to quantify their mass inflow rates and gauge their exact contribution to the Galaxy's gas supply. We use a sample of 1,293 SDSS-V BOSS stellar spectra within 10 degrees of the high-velocity Smith Cloud (SC) to trace Na I absorption and dust extinction as functions of distance. By fitting ISM-corrected MaStar templates to each spectrum, we isolate residual equivalent widths and extinction then compare trends in the SC region to a same-latitude control field. Stars beyond 1 kpc toward the SC exhibit a significant Na I equivalent width excess ($&gt;$0.1 Angstroms, $&gt;$3sigma) relative to the control. Joint fits of Na I equivalent width and Av against both low and high-velocity H I column densities show that the low-velocity component is strongly correlated with both quantities, while the high-velocity term is marginally significant in extinction and consistent with zero in Na I, consistent with a patchy, low dust-to-gas ratio. Given that the excess Na I begins at distances $&lt;2$ kpc uniquely in the direction of the Cloud, and previous estimates of the SC place it at 12.4 $\pm$ 1.3 kpc, further investigation of its distance is warranted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Proper Motion Discoveries from the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey</a><span class="id">[2509.22605]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We used the third data release of the UKIRT Hemisphere Survey to locate previously unrecognized high proper motion objects.

This process provides a natural setting to evaluate the predictive power of generic statistical closure schemes for dynamical correlation functions, in the fully non-linear and non-perturbative regime. We develop a numerical scheme that explicitly implements the seminal &quot;Martin-Siggia-Rose&quot; formalism at one-loop order via an iterative fixed-point approach, thereby improving upon the bare order from the &quot;Direct Interaction Approximation.&quot; Using this framework, we quantitatively validate the ability of the formalism to predict (i) the two-point two-time correlation function; (ii) the renormalised three-point interaction vertex; (iii) the three-point three-time correlation function. These predictions are compared to direct measurements from numerical simulations.

The effect is expected to have observable manifestations, for example, in mergers of astrophysical black holes in Einstein gravity. The black holes with different information loads, although degenerate in the ground state, respond very differently to perturbations. The strength of the imprint is controlled by the memory burden parameter which measures the fraction of the black hole's memory space occupied by the information load. This represents a new macroscopic quantum characteristics of a black hole. We develop a calculable theoretical framework and derive some master formulas which we then test on explicit models of black holes as well as on solitons of high capacity of information storage. We show that the effect must be significant for the spectroscopy of both astrophysical and primordial black holes and can be potentially probed in gravitational wave experiments.

Previous work analyzing JWST NIRSpec and MIRI data yielded a direct metallicity $\rm{12+log(O/H)}=7.79\pm0.09$ ($\sim$ 0.13 $Z_\odot$) and electron density $\rm{log}(n_e / \rm{cm^{-3}}) = 2.9 \pm 0.5$, the most distant such measurements to date. Here we estimate the direct C/O abundance for the first time at $z &gt; 10$, finding a sub-solar ${\rm log(C/O)}=-0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. This is higher than other $z&gt;6$ galaxies with direct C/O measurements, likely due to higher metallicity. It is also slightly higher than galaxies in the local universe with similar metallicity. This may suggest a very efficient and rapid burst of star formation, a low effective oxygen abundance yield, or the presence of unusual stellar populations including supermassive stars. Alternatively, the strong CIII]${\rm {\lambda}{\lambda}}$1907,1909 emission ($14\pm 3\,{Å}$ rest-frame EW) may originate from just one of the two component star clusters JDB ($r \sim 20$ pc).

Its JWST NIRSpec/MSA spectrum shows a significantly blueshifted and deep Na D absorption, revealing a neutral outflow with a velocity of $v_{\rm out}=828^{+79}_{-49}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$ and a mass outflow rate of $\log(\dot{M}_{\rm out}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}})=2.40^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$. This outflow rate exceeds that of any neutral outflows identified beyond $z\sim1$ by the same line diagnostic and is comparable with those in local galaxies with intensive star formation or luminous AGN. Nonetheless, the Paschen $\alpha$ (Pa$\alpha$) emission in the FRESCO NIRCam grism confirms that its star formation rate is low ($\mathrm{SFR_{Pa\alpha}}=10.78\pm 0.55\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}}$), corresponding to a low specific SFR of -10.2 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, 0.5 dex below the main sequence. The best-fit SED modeling based on its multi-band photometry from HST/ACS to JWST/NIRCam and the VLT/MUSE spectrum, suggests this galaxy has experienced a quiescent period lasting about one Gyr or more while seems to rejuvenate within the recent 10 Myr. Surprisingly, rest-frame optical lines indicate that the current AGN activity of JADES-GS-206183, if present, is also weak. Even though we tentatively detect a broad component of the H$\alpha$ line, it is more likely tracing the ionized outflow than an AGN. The results demonstrate that the Na D outflow in JADES-GS-206183 is highly unlikely to be driven by current star formation or nuclear activity. Instead, we propose that this outflow may be a long-lasting fossil one driven by past AGN activity, potentially co-triggered with the early phase of rejuvenation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot Diggity Dog: Simultaneous CO and Dust Modeling of the Most Luminous WISE Hot Dust-Obscured Galaxy Unveils Extreme Molecular Gas Excitation</a><span class="id">[2504.17639]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hot dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs), the most infrared (IR) luminous objects selected by the WISE all-sky mid-IR survey, have yielded a sample of intrinsically luminous quasars (QSOs) with obscured nuclear activity and hot dust temperatures. The molecular gas excitation properties have yet to be examined in detail under such extreme conditions. Here we study the most far-IR luminous \textit{WISE} Hot DOG W2246-0526, focusing on ALMA observations of the central host galaxy. Multi-J CO transition measurements at J=2-1, 5-4, 7-6, 12-11, and 17-16 provide the first self-consistent modeling constraints on the molecular gas and dust properties of any WISE Hot DOG to date, providing a benchmark for future studies of dust-obscured QSOs. We implement a state-of-the-art TUrbulent Non-Equilibrium Radiative transfer model (TUNER) that simultaneously models both the line and dust continuum measurements. The extreme CO spectral line energy distribution seems to turnover around the CO(12-11) transition, likely making this among the most highly excited galaxies ever reported. The model infers a molecular gas mass $\sim 8\times10^{10}$ \Msun, and we conclude that J$\ge$3 CO line luminosities trace the bulk of the molecular gas mass for this extreme system unlike low-excitation conditions calibrated locally. W2246-0526 is a rapidly evolving system, with a high mean value of the molecular gas kinetic temperature versus dust temperature $T_\mathrm{k}$ / $T_\mathrm{d} \sim 4.3$. This may be due to the shocks and outflows injecting kinetic energy within the central kpc of this host that have previously been reported. These signs of highly excited molecular gas in W2246-0526 motivates obtaining well-sampled CO ladders in larger samples to better understand the conditions within these short-lived episodes associated with the most obscured supermassive black hole activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14293" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first direct imaging of the silhouette of a damped Lyman $α$ system along the line-of-sight to a background galaxy</a><span class="id">[2505.14293]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The H {\sc i} gas distribution in damped Lyman $\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) has remained elusive due to the point-source nature of background quasar emission. Observing DLAs against spatially extended background galaxies provides a new method for constraining their size and structure. Using the Keck Cosmic Web Imager, we present the first “silhouette” image of a DLA at $z=3.34$, identified in the spectrum of a background galaxy at $z=3.61$. Although the silhouette remains unresolved due to limited spatial resolution, this represents a successful proof-of-concept for studying DLA morphology using extended background sources. Possible residual emission in the DLA trough suggests an optical depth contrast exceeding $10^7$ in the internal structure, implying a sharp edge or patchy structure. A Lyman $\alpha$ emitter (LAE) at $z_{\rm LAE}=3.3433\pm0.0005$, consistent with the DLA redshift, is detected at an angular separation of $1.''73\pm0.''28$ ($12.9\pm2.1$ kpc). The DLA is surrounded by three galaxies within 140 kpc in projected distance and 500 km s$^{-1}$ in line-of-sight velocity, indicating that it resides in the circumgalactic medium of the LAE or within a galaxy group/protocluster environment. An O {\sc i} $\lambda1302$ absorption at $z_{\rm OI}=3.3288\pm0.0004$ is also detected along the line of sight. This absorber may trace metal-enriched outflow from the LAE or a gas-rich galaxy exhibiting the highest star formation activity among the surrounding galaxies.

Forward-modelling offers a powerful framework to simultaneously recover galaxy $n(z)$s and characterise the observed galaxy population. We present GalSBI-SPS, a new SPS-based galaxy population model that generates realistic galaxy catalogues, which we use to forward-model HSC data in the COSMOS field. GalSBI-SPS samples galaxy physical properties, computes magnitudes with ProSpect, and simulates HSC images in the COSMOS field with UFig. We measure photometric properties consistently in real data and simulations. We compare $n(z)$s, photometric and physical properties to observations and to GalSBI. GalSBI-SPS reproduces the observed grizy magnitude, colour, and size distributions down to i&lt;23. Median differences in magnitudes and colours remain below 0.14 mag, with the model covering the full colour space spanned by HSC. Galaxy sizes are overestimated by 0.2 arcsec on average and some tension exists in the g-r colour, but the latter is comparable to that seen in GalSBI. $n(z)$s show a mild positive offset (0.01-0.08) in the mean. GalSBI-SPS qualitatively reproduces the stellar mass-SFR and size-stellar mass relations seen in COSMOS2020. GalSBI-SPS provides a realistic, survey-independent galaxy population description at a Stage-III depth using only literature-based parameters. Its predictive power will improve significantly when constrained against observed data using SBI, thereby providing accurate $n(z)$s satisfying the stringent requirements set by Stage IV surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Fuzzy Situation Eased: Cold Dark Matter with Multipoles Can Explain The Double Radio Quad Lens HS 0810+2554</a><span class="id">[2506.03132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Originally observed in isophotal density contours of elliptical galaxies, higher order perturbations in the form of Fourier modes, or multipoles, are becoming increasingly recognized as necessary to account for angular mass complexity in strong lensing analyses. When smooth, elliptical CDM mass models fail, multipoles often emerge as solutions. With the discovery of two radio jets in the source quasar, the strong gravitational lens HS 0810+2554 can no longer be well fit by elliptical mass models, suggesting perturbations on small-scales. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of multipoles $m=1$ (lopsidedness), $m=3$ (triangleness), and $m=4$ (boxiness and diskiness) in addressing the image positional anomalies of the two radio quads of HS 0810+2554. Due to the exact pairing and arrival sequence of the images being unknown, we consider all feasible image configurations. With 64 unique best-fit models, we achieve a fit of $\chi=1.59$ ($\chi^2=2.53$), with $m=1,3,4$ multipole strengths of 0.9%, 0.4%, and 0.6%, respectively, with images in the reverse time ordering. Elliptical+shear models from previous works find $\chi\!\sim\!7\!-\!10$, for comparison. With the morphological (i.e., standard) arrival sequence, we achieve a fit of $\chi=2.95$ with two images being assigned to opposite sources. Therefore, CDM mass models with mass complexity in the form of multipoles are able to adequately explain the positional anomalies in HS 0810+2554. Alternative dark matter theories, like fuzzy dark matter, need not be invoked.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04310" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Rotators at Cosmic Noon: Stellar Kinematics for 15 Quiescent Galaxies from JWST-SUSPENSE</a><span class="id">[2506.04310]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of 15 massive ($M_*=10^{10.5-11.5}M_{\odot}$) quiescent galaxies at $z\sim1.2-2.3$ from the JWST-SUSPENSE program. This is the largest sample of spatially-resolved kinematic measurements of quiescent galaxies at cosmic noon to date. Our measurements are derived from ultra-deep NIRSpec/MSA stellar absorption line spectra, using a forward modelling approach that accounts for optics, source morphology, positioning, and data reduction effects. 10 out of 15 galaxies are orientated such that we can measure rotational support. Remarkably, all 10 galaxies show significant rotation ($V_{r_e}=117-345$km/s, $\sigma_0 = 180-387$km/s), and are classified as &quot;fast rotators&quot; from their spin parameter. The remaining galaxies are too misaligned with respect to the slit to constrain their rotational velocities. The widespread rotational support in our sample indicates that the process responsible for quenching star formation in early massive galaxies did not destroy rotating disc structures. When combined with other quiescent galaxy samples at $z\sim0.5-2.5$, we find a trend between rotational support and age, with younger quiescent galaxies being more rotationally supported. This age trend has also been found at $z\sim0$, and likely explains why our high-redshift galaxies show more rotational support compared to massive ETGs at $z\sim0$, which are, on average, older. Our kinematic modelling also enables us to calculate dynamical masses. These dynamical masses greatly exceed the stellar masses for our sample (median $M_{\text{dyn}}/M_*=2.7$); they even allow for the bottom-heavy IMF found in the cores of low-$z$ massive ellipticals. Altogether, our results support a scenario in which distant quiescent galaxies evolve into nearby massive ETGs, gradually building up their outskirts and simultaneously losing rotation, due to a series of (mostly minor) mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST lens model for A370: A very low dark matter fraction for a brightest cluster galaxy and lensing properties for the Dragon arc</a><span class="id">[2506.11207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new lens model for the $z=0.375$ galaxy cluster Abell 370 based on previously spectroscopically confirmed lensed galaxies and new lensed systems identified in JWST data, including recent data from the MAGNIF program. Based on the best models able to reproduce two radial arcs near the BCGs, we compare the stellar mass to the total mass from the lens model and find that the fraction of dark matter in the south BCG is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM while in the north BCG we find a very small amount of dark matter, more consistent with alternative models to $\Lambda$CDM. We discuss possible causes for this and conclude that additional data is needed to clarify the situation. We study the lensing properties, magnification, time delay and strength of the critical curve, along the Dragon arc, where previous studies have reported tens of alleged microlensing events from supergiant stars at $z=0.7251$. The new lens model is able to reproduce the distribution of microlensing events with great accuracy. Some of the microlensing events may be reinterpreted as long-period Cepheid in future observations. We consider this possibility and study in more detail the challenges for such detection from intervening microlenses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing the Origins of Hot Halo Gas in Milky Way-Type Galaxies with SMUGGLE</a><span class="id">[2508.21576]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current galaxy formation models predict the existence of X-ray-emitting gaseous halos around Milky Way (MW)-type galaxies. To investigate properties of this coronal gas in MW-like galaxies, we analyze a suite of high-resolution simulations based on the SMUGGLE framework and compare the results with X-ray observations of both the MW and external galaxies. We find that for subgrid models incorporating any form of stellar feedback, e.g., early feedback (including stellar winds and radiation) and/or supernova (SN) explosions, the total 0.5-2 keV luminosity is consistent within uncertainties with X-ray observations of the MW and with scaling relations derived for external disk galaxies. However, all models exhibit an X-ray surface brightness profile that declines too steeply beyond $\sim5$ kpc, underpredicting the extended emission seen in recent eROSITA stacking results. Across all subgrid prescriptions, the simulated surface brightness and emission measure fall below MW observations by at least 1-2 orders of magnitude, with the most severe discrepancy occurring in the no-feedback model. Our results suggest that (i) stellar feedback primarily shapes the innermost hot atmosphere (central $\sim5$ kpc), with comparable contributions from early feedback and SNe to the resulting X-ray luminosity; (ii) additional mechanisms such as gravitational heating, active galactic nuclei feedback, and/or Compton effects of GeV cosmic ray are necessary to generate the extended, volume-filling hot gaseous halo of MW-mass galaxies; (iii) the origins of hot corona in MW-like galaxies are partially distinct from those of the warm ($\sim10^5$ K) gas, by combining our previous finding that the SMUGGLE model successfully reproduces the kinematics and spatial distribution of MW O VI absorbers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disclosing Submillimeter Galaxy Formation: Mergers or Secular Evolution?</a><span class="id">[2509.07913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the morphology of 125 submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the PRIMER-COSMOS field using double Sersic modeling on JWST NIRCam images across six bands (F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M and F444W), with SMGs being classified by bulge Sersic index (n_bulge) and bulge-to-total luminosity ratio (B/T). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test between the bright (SFR &gt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) and the faint group (SFR &lt; 175 M_sun yr^{-1}) reveals no significant statistical differences in morphology across bands. However, we notice that SMGs skew towards higher B/T ratios and lower n_bulge from shorter to longer wavelengths. In F444W, bright SMGs exhibit higher B/T and lower n_bulge, indicating flatter, disturbed bulges, while faint SMGs show lower B/T and higher n_bulge. Notably, SMGs with higher B/T tend to have low Sersic index, challenging the local universe dichotomy of classical bulges (B/T &gt; 0.5, n &gt; 4) versus pseudo-bulges (B/T &lt; 0.35, n &lt; 2). In the F277W band, non-parametric measurements indicate predominantly disk-dominated patterns, with only 24 percent of SMGs demonstrating merger signatures. After the removal of SMGs with disturbed morphology, the bulge classification scheme in F277W shows pseudo-bulges (21 percent) and clump migration bulges (16 percent) from secular evolution, compared to 4 percent merger-built bulges. Surprisingly, 48 percent of SMGs defy the classification scheme, showing high B/T (approximately 0.7) but low Sersic index (n_bulge &lt;= 1). Bars are confirmed in 7 percent of SMGs. This work suggests that secular evolution takes precedence over major mergers, supporting the idea that isolated evolution fueled by filamentary gas inflow plays a non-negligible role in the SMG bulge formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Discovery of a Large Active Wind from the Milky Way's Central Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2509.10615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Every large galaxy has a black hole in its center.

The key feature of this interaction are black hole jets - or more generally winds - which every black hole must have. Despite our Galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), proximity and importance, the active wind from it has eluded scientists for over half a century. Here we report the discovery of a large active wind from Sgr A* using unprecedentedly deep observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect a large conical clearing in the cold molecular gas surrounding Sgr A* that is at least 1 parsec in length and has a 45-degree opening angle. The morphology and energetics of this structure are consistent with active clearing by a hot wind from Sgr A*. This finding resolves the long-standing mystery of the missing wind from Sgr A*, and delivers the most detailed look yet of black hole feeding and feedback processes in our Galactic center.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A GLIMPSE of Intermediate Mass Black holes in the epoch of reionization: Witnessing the Descendants of Direct Collapse?</a><span class="id">[2509.20452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST has revealed an abundance of supermassive black holes (BHs) in the early Universe, and yet the lowest mass seed black holes that gave rise to these populations remain elusive. Here we present a systematic search for broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) in some of the faintest high-$z$ galaxies surveyed yet by combining ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec G395M spectroscopy with the strong lensing aid in Abell S1063. By employing the profile of the [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ emission lines as a template for narrow-line components and carefully cross-validating with mock observations, we identify a sample of ten broad-line AGNs at $4.5&lt;z&lt;7.0$ (eight secure, two tentative). The inferred BH masses from the broad H$\alpha$ line explore the intermediate BH mass regime down to $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$. The stellar mass ($M_*$) is estimated with a galaxy+AGN composite model, and we find the BH to stellar mass ratio spans down to $M_{\rm BH}/M_*\lesssim 0.1\%$, unveiling populations on the empirical $M_{\rm BH}-M*$ relation observed in the local universe. We also derive the black hole mass function and investigate its low-mass end at this epoch. While we confirm the agreement of our results with previous studies at $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{6.5}M_{\odot}$, we find the mass range of $\sim 10^{5.5}\,M_\odot$ features an enhanced abundance with respect to the extrapolated best-fit Schechter function. Comparison with theoretical models suggests that a possible origin for this enhanced abundance is the direct-collapse BH formation, supporting the scenario that the direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a significant pathway for the earliest supermassive BHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outflow-cloud interaction as the possible origin of the peculiar radio emission in the tidal disruption event AT2018cqh</a><span class="id">[2509.21299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AT2018cqh is a unique optical tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered in a dwarf galaxy exhibiting delayed X-ray and radio flares. We present the results from high-resolution VLBA and e-MERLIN radio observations of AT2018cqh extending to $\delta$t $\sim$ 2250 days post discovery, which reveal a compact radio emission, unresolved at a scale of &lt;  0.13 pc at 7.6 GHz, with a high brightness temperature of $T_b$  &gt; 4.03 $\times$ 10$^{9}$ K. The radio spectral energy distribution (SED) is found to gradually shift towards a higher peak flux density and frequency over a period of $\sim$1000 days. An equipartition analysis suggests that there is a little change in the radio emitting region over this period, while the electron density increases by a factor of 3. The radio light curve at 0.89 GHz continues to rise, with a bump feature lasting for 240 days. These properties are in contrast to the predictions of standard shockwave model from a diffuse circumnuclear medium, but could be explained if dense clouds exist in the circumnuclear environment. The latter scenario is supported by our hydrodynamic simulations of the interaction of TDE outflow with a cloud, which can reproduce the temporal evolution in the radio SED. This work highlights the importance of the outflow-cloud interaction in explaining the delayed, fast-rising radio emission observed in some TDEs, especially those occurring in galaxies with pre-existing AGN activity.</p></div></details></article>

The distribution of the dust can reveal the presence of forming planets and its composition can directly trace that of comets, asteroids and even planets. While we have been observing debris disks for 40 years now, most observations so far have been restricted to the cold outer regions of the system, and therefore information of the terrestrial zone is still missing.

In radio astronomy, most time-domain detection methods cannot find these pulsars, and current image-based detection approaches still face challenges, including low sensitivity, high false positive rate, and low computational efficiency. In this article, we develop Fast Imaging Trigger (FITrig), a GPU-accelerated, statistics-based method for ULP pulsar detection and localisation. FITrig includes two complementary approaches – an image domain and an image-frequency domain strategy. FITrig offers advantages by increasing sensitivity to faint pulsars, suppressing false positives (from noise, processing artefacts, or steady sources), and improving search efficiency in large-scale wide-field images. Compared to the state-of-the-art source finder SOFIA 2, FITrig increases the detection speed by 4.3 times for large images (50K x 50K pixels) and reduces false positives by up to 858.8 times (at 6$\sigma$ significance) for the image domain branch, while the image-frequency domain branch suppresses false positives even further. FITrig maintains the capability to detect pulsars that are 20 times fainter than surrounding steady features, even under critical Nyquist sampling conditions. In this article, the performance of FITrig is demonstrated using both real-world data (MeerKAT observations of PSR J0901-4046) and simulated datasets based on MeerKAT and SKA AA2 telescope configurations. With its real-time processing capabilities and scalability, FITrig is a promising tool for next-generation telescopes, such as the SKA, with the potential to uncover hidden ULP pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Early Universe with Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2509.22018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hydrogen is the most abundant element in our Universe. The first generation of stars and galaxies produced photons that ionized hydrogen gas, driving a cosmological event known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The upcoming Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will map the distribution of neutral hydrogen during this era, aiding in the study of the properties of these first-generation objects. Extracting astrophysical information will be challenging, as SKAO will produce a tremendous amount of data where the hydrogen signal will be contaminated with undesired foreground contamination and instrumental systematics. To address this, we develop the latest deep learning techniques to extract information from the 2D power spectra of the hydrogen signal expected from SKAO. We apply a series of neural network models to these measurements and quantify their ability to predict the history of cosmic hydrogen reionization, which is connected to the increasing number and efficiency of early photon sources. We show that the study of the early Universe benefits from modern deep learning technology. In particular, we demonstrate that dedicated machine learning algorithms can achieve more than a $0.95$ $R^2$ score on average in recovering the reionization history. This enables accurate and precise cosmological and astrophysical inference of structure formation in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimization procedure of the baffle of the GroundBIRD Telescope to mitigate stray light</a><span class="id">[2509.22071]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We presented the optimization procedures of the baffle mounted on the GroundBIRD telescope for measuring the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB).

The motivation behind this method is two-fold: Firstly, it provides individual temperature detector maps from a multi-detector set, which may be useful for component separation purposes, in particular for line emission reconstruction. Secondly, it simultaneously outputs coadded polarization maps with minimal temperature-to-polarization leakage sensitivity. Algorithmically speaking, the N+2 mapmaker is closely related to the `spurious mapmaking' algorithm pioneered by the WMAP team, but rather than solving for a spurious S map together with the three normal Stokes IQU parameters, we solve for N temperature maps and two Stokes (Q and U) parameters per pixel. The result is a statistically coherent set of physically meaningful per-detector temperature maps, each with slightly different bandpasses as defined by each detector, combined with coadded polarization maps. We test this approach on Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) 30 GHz data, and find that the Planck scanning strategy is too poorly cross-linked to allow for a clean separation between temperature and polarization. However, noting that pairs of detectors within a single horn are strongly anti-correlated, we anticipate that solving for horn maps, as opposed to individual detector maps, may provide an optimal compromise between noise and temperature-to-polarization leakage minimization. When applied to simulated data with a rotating half-wave plate, for which the polarization angle coverage is greatly improved, the algorithm performs as expected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Simons Observatory: Characterization of the 220/280 GHz TES Detector Modules</a><span class="id">[2509.22382]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Simons Observatory (SO) is a new suite of cosmic microwave background telescopes in the Chilean Atacama Desert with an extensive science program spanning cosmology, Galactic and extragalactic astrophysics, and particle physics. SO will survey the millimeter-wave sky over a wide range of angular scales using six spectral bands across three types of dichroic, polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor (TES) detector modules: Low-Frequency (LF) modules with bandpasses centered near 30 and 40 GHz, Mid-Frequency (MF) modules near 90 and 150 GHz, and Ultra-High-Frequency (UHF) modules near 220 and 280 GHz. Twenty-five UHF detector modules, each containing 1720 optically-coupled TESs connected to microwave SQUID multiplexing readout, have now been produced. This work summarizes the pre-deployment characterization of these detector modules in laboratory cryostats. Across all UHF modules, we find an average operable TES yield of 83%, equating to over 36,000 devices tested. The distributions of (220, 280) GHz saturation powers have medians of (24, 26) pW, near the centers of their target ranges. For both bands, the median optical efficiency is 0.6, the median effective time constant is 0.4 ms, and the median dark noise-equivalent power (NEP) is  40 aW/rtHz. The expected photon NEPs at (220, 280) GHz are (64, 99) aW/rtHz, indicating these detectors will achieve background-limited performance on the sky. Thirty-nine UHF and MF detector modules are currently operating in fielded SO instruments, which are transitioning from the commissioning stage to full science observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hyper-py: HYbrid Photometry and Extraction Routine in PYthon</a><span class="id">[2509.22453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Hyper-Py, a fully restructured and extended Python implementation of HYPER (HYbrid Photometry and Extraction Routine, Traficante et al. 2015).

HYPER combines source detection via high-pass filtering, background estimation through local polynomial fitting, and source modeling with 2D elliptical Gaussians, simultaneously fitting multiple Gaussians to deblend overlapping sources. Hyper-Py preserves the original logic while offering improvements in performance, configurability, and background modeling capabilities, making it a flexible modern tool for source extraction and photometry across diverse datasets.

Recent advancements in simulation and nanofabrication techniques have significantly accelerated the design and prototyping phases. Nonetheless, detector characterization continues to be a major bottleneck in device development. During the testing phase, a significant time investment is required to characterize the device in different operating conditions and find optimal operating parameters. The total effort spent on characterization and parameter optimization can occupy a year or more of an expert's time. In this work, we present a novel technique for automated sensor calibration that aims to accelerate the testing stage of the development cycle. This technique leverages closed-loop Bayesian optimization (BO), using real-time measurements to guide parameter selection and identify optimal operating states. We demonstrate the method with a novel low-noise CCD, showing that the machine learning-driven tool can efficiently characterize and optimize operation of the sensor in a couple of days without supervision of a device expert.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Background stability and annual modulation test using PICOLON ultra-pure NaI(Tl) detector</a><span class="id">[2509.22021]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dark matter observation claimed by the DAMA/LIBRA experiment has been a long-standing puzzle within the particle physics community. NaI(Tl) crystals with radiopurity comparable to DAMA/LIBRA's are essential for adequate verification. Existing experiments using NaI(Tl) target have been hampered by the high radioactivity concentration of NaI(Tl) crystals. PICOLON experiment conducts an independent search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using highest purity NaI(Tl) crystals. In 2020, the NaI(Tl) crystal (Ingot#85) reached the same purity level as DAMA/LIBRA crystals. The DAMA/LIBRA group has stressed that verifying their signal requires high-purity NaI(Tl) crystals with long-term stability. Based on a six-month measurement, we have confirmed the long-term stability of its radiopurity. This stability provides a significant advantage for future efforts to adequately verify the DAMA/LIBRA result using NaI(Tl) crystal. In this paper, we present the background stability of purity in the Ingot#94 NaI(Tl) detector, which was produced using the Ingot#85 purification method, along with the first annual modulation search conducted by the PICOLON experiment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engaging and Educating Eclipse Observers Through Workshops, Media, Planetarium shows and Citizen Science</a><span class="id">[2509.22348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Heliophysics Big Year was an extended year where major solar events engaged the public.

After the eclipse of 2017, many millions more Americans planned to view the solar corona. We expanded our eclipse website with activities, citizen science projects, resources, training videos, equipment, and external links. We were the Southwest Regional Coordinator for Citizen CATE 2024 project, training the state coordinators and their teams with the equipment and procedures. We trained teachers at local, regional, national, and international workshops, providing eclipse viewing cards, lenses to make solar cup projectors, a safe viewing screen pattern, and access to the training materials. We made presentations to the media and hosted public events to demonstrate safe eclipse viewing techniques. HMNS hosted live viewing for the annular and total plus solstice and equinox events, reaching tens of thousands of people. HMNS also secured a grant to provide 100 eclipse viewing cards for every public school (8,800+) in Texas. We distributed another 57,000 eclipse viewers to teachers and the public. We appeared in media both in advance of the eclipses and as live commentators. The most lasting and impactful product was our planetarium show Totality, which was given away free and shown in various formats (flatscreen, fisheye, or prewarped). Over 180,000 views of the show and its animations have been documented. We continued to improve our space weather forecasting site, which correctly predicted the major solar storms of May 10-11 and October 8-10, 2024.

Machine learning based detection and parameter estimation algorithms are emerging as production ready alternatives to traditional approaches. Here, we report validation studies of AMPLFI, a likelihood-free inference solution to low-latency parameter estimation of binary black holes. We use simulated signals added into data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's (LVK's) third observing run (O3) to compare sky localization performance with BAYESTAR, the algorithm currently in production for rapid sky localization of candidates from matched-filter pipelines. We demonstrate sky localization performance, measured by searched area and volume, to be equivalent with BAYESTAR. We show accurate reconstruction of source parameters with uncertainties for use distributing low-latency coarse-grained chirp mass information. In addition, we analyze several candidate events reported by the LVK in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3) and show consistency with the LVK's analysis. Altogether, we demonstrate AMPLFI's ability to produce data products for low-latency public alerts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15072" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outer Solar System spacecraft to probe the $μ$Hz gravitational wave frontier</a><span class="id">[2411.15072]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require further development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids onboard inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve gravitational wave sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $\sim 10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks could be achieved with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that, despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concepts require two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data</a><span class="id">[2509.10505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary &quot;blind search&quot; capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Educational Guide for 2D Stellar Structure Calculations of Rapidly Rotating Stars using the ESTER code</a><span class="id">[2509.20264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Evolution STEllaire en Rotation (ESTER) code is the first 2D stellar structure code to be made open-source and freely available to the astronomy and astrophysics community. An important and novel advancement of this code is that it can reproduce the distorted shape and observable signatures (e.g., gravity darkening) of rapidly rotating stars. ESTER also calculates the steady-state large-scale flows within the star, namely their differential rotation and associated meridional circulation. In this report, we explore and document the physics implemented within version 1.1.0rc2 of the ESTER code, in a way that complements published descriptions. We illustrate this physics by plotting how stellar structure parameters vary through stellar interiors at a range of latitudes and at different angular velocities. We investigate how the thin convective envelopes of intermediate mass stars vary with latitude when rapidly rotating, becoming deeper and thicker near the equator. Simple comparisons of ESTER model predictions (e.g., central temperature and density, luminosity) with the output from the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code [Paxton et al., 2010] shows generally good agreement. Additional comparisons provide important benchmarking and verification for ESTER as a comparatively young code. Finally, we provide a guide for installing and running the code on our local university cluster, aimed at helping students to begin work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attention U-Net for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches</a><span class="id">[2509.19838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting continuous gravitational waves is challenging due to the high computational cost of template-based searches across large parameter spaces, particularly for all-sky searches. Machine learning offers a promising solution to perform these searches with reasonable computational resources. In this study, we trained an attention U-Net, a convolutional neural network, on $\approx$ 10.67 days of simulated data with Gaussian noise for all-sky searches at different frequencies within the 20-1000 Hz band. Our model trained at 20 Hz achieves the best sensitivity, with a 90% detection efficiency sensitivity depth $D^{90\%} = 29.97 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ with a 1% false alarm rate per 50 mHz, while the model trained on the entire 20-1000 Hz band yields $D^{90\%} = 18.63 \pm 0.24\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$. The sensitivities achieved are comparable to state-of-the-art results using deep learning approaches, with less than 50% of the training time and data. We find that sensitivity scales as $T^{0.28 \pm 0.01}$ with total observation time for the attention U-Net trained at 20 Hz, similar to semi-coherent search methods. The neural network demonstrates robustness on datasets with time gaps, with sensitivity dependence on duty factor analyzed. We also investigated the sensitivity dependence of the trained attention U-Net models on sky location. Our findings show that attention U-Net is a scalable and effective approach for all-sky continuous gravitational wave searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Regression of Suspension Violin Modes in KAGRA O3GK Data with Kalman Filters</a><span class="id">[2509.20658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Suspension thermal modes in interferometric gravitational-wave detectors produce narrow, high-Q spectral lines that can contaminate gravitational searches and bias parameter estimation. In KAGRA, cryogenic mirrors are held by thick suspension fibers, designed to sustain such low-temperature environment, which may further affects inharmonicity modes, fiber dimensions, and mechanical behavior compared to typical interferometers. Remaining a prominent source of narrowband contamination, we implement a Kalman filter to model and track violin lines, building on the methodology introduced in [1], and apply subtraction to KAGRA O3GK data. Using gravitational-wave template injections, we validate that the subtraction preserves matched-filter SNR while effectively suppressing line power. Comparisons of power spectral densities and residual analyses confirm that the method removes deterministic line contributions without introducing waveform distortions. This approach provides a cleaner strain channel for searches and parameter estimation and will become increasingly important for future low-temperature detectors with higher-Q suspensions, such as the Einstein Telescope.</p></div></details></article></body>
