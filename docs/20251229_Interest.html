<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Professor Hideki Yukawa's Anguish and a Lifelong Decision During a Three-Day Visit to Kochi to Unveil His First Bronze Statue: From a Cave Bat to the World</a><span class="id">[2512.21858]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In 1954, following a five-year research period in the U.S., Professor Hideki Yukawa returned to Japan and visited Kochi on March 21 to attend the unveiling ceremony for the first statue of him ever built in Japan, a project initiated by the PTA of Yasu Elementary School in Yasu Town, Kochi Prefecture. By a coincidence of history, just three weeks prior on March 1, the U.S. had conducted a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean. Many Japanese fishing boats were operating there at the time and had not been informed in advance. As a result, numerous boats, including the Daigo Fukuryu Maru, were exposed to radiation. Upon his arrival at Kochi Station on the evening of March 21, Yukawa was relentlessly questioned by reporters about the Bikini hydrogen bomb. This was a source of deep anguish for Yukawa, a Japanese physicist who had won the Nobel Prize for his work on &quot;atomic physics.&quot; He firmly refused to answer, stating that the topic was &quot;outside the scope of my research.&quot; The next evening, at a public lecture in Kochi City on March 22, he again refused to speak about the Bikini hydrogen bomb or nuclear power, stating that he was an amateur in nuclear research and that there were many other experts. However, just four days later, on March 28, after returning to Kyoto, Yukawa drafted his famous essay, &quot;The Turning Point for Humanity and Atomic Power,&quot; which was published in a newspaper on March 30. From that point on, he was drawn into the tumultuous issue of the Bikini hydrogen bomb and nuclear power. When did a tormented Yukawa make his decision? This article meticulously reveals, based on historical documents, what led the anguished Yukawa to make such a rapid decision within a single day and what caused the immense change in his mindset overnight.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Universe in four letters: a bedtime history</a><span class="id">[2512.21355]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One evening, a father tells his three daughters, Lucía, Inés, and Ana, a bedtime story unlike any other. It is a tale of four silent architects ($c$, $\hbar$, $G$, and $\Lambda$) whose presence or absence shapes the very fabric of reality. By imagining worlds where each constant is removed, they explore realms from the quantum gravity of the Planck scale to the stretching cosmos of de Sitter space, from the mass of the observable Universe to the surprising link with the proton's whisper. Woven with the insights of great scientists, this narrative reveals how these fundamental constants write the story of everything, from the smallest particle to the vast cosmic horizon, suggesting a beautiful and hidden unity in the architecture of our world.</p></div></details></article></body>
