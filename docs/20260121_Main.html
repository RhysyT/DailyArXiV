In our simulations, the innermost planet's semimajor axis is set at 1 AU, with subsequent semimajor axes spaced equally in terms of planets' mutual Hill radii. Several sets of initial planetary longitudes are investigated, with integrations continuing for up to $10^{10}$ orbits of the innermost planet, stopping if a pair of planets pass within 0.01 AU of each other or if a planet is ejected from the system. We find that the simulated lifetimes of four-planet systems follow the general trend of increasing exponentially with planetary spacing, as seen by previous studies of closely-spaced planets. Four-planet system lifetimes are intermediate between those of three- and five-planet systems and more similar to the latter. Moreover, as with five-planet systems, but in marked contrast to the three-planet case, no initial semimajor axes spacings are found to yield systems that survive several orders of magnitude longer than other similar spacings. First- and second-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) between planets correlate with reductions in system lifetimes. Additionally, we find that third-order MMRs between planets on neighboring orbits also have a substantial, though smaller, destabilizing effect on systems very near resonance that otherwise would be very long-lived. Local extrema of system lifetimes as a function of planetary spacing occur at slightly smaller initial orbital separation for systems with planets initially at conjunction relative to those in which the planets begin on widely-separated longitudes. This shift is produced by the asymmetric mutual planetary perturbations as the planets separate in longitude from the initial aligned configuration that cause orbits to spread out in semimajor axis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) I: Motivation, sample, data reduction, and results overview</a><span class="id">[2601.11708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The outer regions of planetary systems host dusty debris discs analogous to the Kuiper belt (exoKuiper belts), which provide crucial constraints on planet formation and evolution processes. ALMA dust observations have revealed a great diversity, and that some belts contain CO gas, whose origin and implications are uncertain. Most of this progress, however, has been limited by low-resolution observations. We conducted the first ALMA large programme dedicated to debris discs: the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS). We selected the 24 most promising belts to constrain their detailed radial and vertical structure, and to characterise the gas content. We constrained the radial and vertical distribution of dust, as well as the presence of asymmetries. For a subset of six belts with CO gas, we constrained the gas distribution and kinematics. To interpret these observations, we used a wide range of dynamical models. The first ARKS results are presented as a series of ten papers. We discovered that up to 33% of our sample exhibits multiple dusty rings. For highly inclined belts, we found that non-Gaussian vertical distributions are common and are indicative of multiple dynamical populations. We also found that 10 of the 24 belts present asymmetries. We find that the CO gas is radially broader than the dust, but this could be an effect of optical depth. At least one system shows non-Keplerian kinematics due to strong pressure gradients, which may have triggered a vortex that trapped dust in an arc. Finally, we find evidence that the micron-sized grains may be affected by gas drag in gas rich systems. ARKS has revealed a great diversity of structures in exoKuiper belts that may arise when they are formed in protoplanetary discs or subsequently via interactions with planets and/or gas. We encourage the community to explore the reduced data and data products.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) IX: Gas-driven origin for the continuum arc in the debris disc of HD 121617</a><span class="id">[2601.11709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Debris discs were long considered to be largely gas-free environments governed by collisional fragmentation, gravitational stirring, and radiative forces. Recent CO detections show that gas is present, but its abundance and origin remain uncertain. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) revealed a narrow gas and dust ring in the disc HD 121617 with an asymmetric arc 40% brighter than the rest of the ring. We aim to constrain the total gas mass in HD 121617 assuming the dust arc is produced by hydrodynamical gas-dust interactions. We used the Dusty FARGO-ADSG code, modelling dust as Lagrangian particles, including radiation pressure and dust feedback, and varying the total gas mass. Simulations were compared to observations using radiative transfer. An unstable gas ring creates a size-dependent radial and azimuthal dust trap whose efficiency depends on gas mass. Two models, with 50 and 5 Earth masses of gas, reproduce both the ALMA band 7 arc and the outward offset of the VLT/SPHERE scattered-light ring via gas drag and radiation pressure. We infer a conservative gas-mass range of 2.5 to 250 Earth masses. If the ALMA asymmetry is caused by gas drag, the required gas mass compared with the observed CO implies substantial H2, consistent with primordial gas. HD 121617 would then be a hybrid disc between protoplanetary and debris stages. Since a planet could also create an arc, future observations are needed to distinguish these scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) VIII: A dust arc and non-Keplerian gas kinematics in HD 121617</a><span class="id">[2601.11711]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>ExoKuiper belts around young A-type stars often host CO gas, whose origin is still unclear. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) includes 6 of these gas-bearing belts, to characterise their dust and gas distributions and investigate the gas origin. As part of ARKS, we observed the gas-rich system HD121617 and discovered an arc of enhanced dust density. In this paper, we analyse in detail the dust and gas distributions and the gas kinematics of this system. We extracted radial and azimuthal profiles of the dust (in the millimetre and near-infrared) and gas emission ($^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO) from reconstructed images. To constrain the morphology of the arc, we fitted an asymmetric model to the dust emission. To characterise the gas kinematics, we fitted a Keplerian model to the velocity map and extracted the azimuthal velocity profile by deprojecting the data. We find that the dust arc is narrow (1-5 au wide at a radius of 75 au), azimuthally extended, and asymmetric; the emission is more azimuthally compact in the direction of the system's rotation, and represents 13% of the total dust mass (0.2$M_\oplus$). The arc is much less pronounced or absent for small grains and gas. Finally, we find strong non-Keplerian azimuthal velocities at the inner and outer wings of the ring, as was expected due to strong pressure gradients. The dust arc resembles the asymmetries found in protoplanetary discs, often interpreted as the result of dust trapping in vortices. If the gas disc mass is high enough ($\gtrsim20M_\oplus$, requiring a primordial gas origin), both the radial confinement of the ring and the azimuthal arc may result from dust grains responding to gas drag. Alternatively, it could result from planet-disc interactions via mean motion resonances. Further studies should test these hypotheses and may provide a dynamical gas mass estimate in this CO-rich exoKuiper belt.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of High X-Ray Polarization from the Neutron Star Low-Mass X-Ray Binary Cyg X-2 in the Horizontal Branch</a><span class="id">[2601.11718]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from simultaneous X-ray polarimetric and spectroscopic observations of the bright neutron star low-mass X-ray binary Cyg X-2, performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). IXPE detected significant polarization (15 sigma) from the source in the 2-8 keV energy band with an average polarization degree (PD) of 4.5% +/- 0.3% and a polarization angle (PA) of 128 +/- 2 degrees as the source moved along the horizontal branch of its Z-track. The PD increases with energy reaching 9.9% +/- 2.8% in the 7-8 keV band, with no evidence for energy-dependent variation in the PA. The PA is roughly consistent with previous measurements obtained during the normal and flaring branches and also with the known radio jet axis. From spectropolarimetric analysis, the main contribution to the polarized radiation is due to Comptonized photons, but the polarization is higher than predicted in typical spreading layer geometries. The observed high polarization may be due to a combination of a highly polarized reflected component and a moderately polarized spreading layer on the neutron star surface or produced by electron scattering in an equatorial wind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS). X. Interpreting the peculiar dust rings around HD 131835</a><span class="id">[2601.11732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dusty discs detected around main-sequence stars are thought to be signs of planetesimal belts in which the dust distribution is shaped by collisional and dynamical processes, including interactions with gas if present. The debris disc around the young A-type star HD 131835 is composed of two dust rings at  65 au and  100 au, a third unconstrained innermost component, and a gaseous component centred at  65 au. New ALMA observations show that the inner of the two dust rings is brighter than the outer one, in contrast with previous observations in scattered light. We explore two scenarios that could explain these observations: the two dust rings might represent distinct planetesimal belts with different collisional properties, or only the inner ring might contain planetesimals while the outer ring consists entirely of dust that has migrated outwards due to gas drag. To explore the first scenario, we employed a state-of-the-art collisional evolution code. To test the second scenario, we used a simple dynamical model of dust grain evolution in an optically thin gaseous disc. Collisional models of two planetesimal belts cannot fully reproduce the observations by only varying their dynamical excitation, and matching the data through a different material strength requires an extreme difference in dust composition. The gas-driven scenario can reproduce the location of the outer ring and the brightness ratio of the two rings from scattered light observations, but the resulting outer ring is too faint overall in both scattered light and sub-millimetre emission. The dust rings in HD 131835 could be produced from two planetesimal belts, although how these belts would attain the required extremely different properties needs to be explained. The dust-gas interaction is a plausible alternative explanation and deserves further study using a more comprehensive model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black hole accretion disks with outflows II. Time dependent Green's function solutions in Newtonian gravity</a><span class="id">[2601.11754]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Green's function solutions of the Newtonian time-dependent thin disk equations in the presence of outflows, showing that simple and exact analytical expressions exist in various natural limits of the problem. These Green's functions are mathematically very similar to the classical Lynden-Bell &amp; Pringle solutions in the absence of outflows, but differ strongly in their precise physical details and observational implications. Solutions are presented for phenomenological radius-dependent outflows which both do and do not torque the local accretion flow, and for outflows which are launched proportional to the local accretion rate. Generically, outflows lead to a more rapid decay of the bolometric luminosity of the disk, flatten the radial dependence of the disk temperature, and suppress variability in the accretion rate at small radii and low frequencies (on long timescales). Observational implications of these four results are discussed in detail.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS): VI. Asymmetries and offsets</a><span class="id">[2601.11766]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asymmetries in debris discs provide unique clues to understand the evolution and architecture of planetary systems.** The aim of the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is to expand our understanding of radial and vertical dust structures, as well as gas distributions and kinematics, in debris discs.** Here, in ARKS VI, we present a systematic analysis of the asymmetries and stellocentric offsets present in the ALMA continuum data for the ARKS survey. Our aims are to identify asymmetries in debris disc dust distributions, quantify debris disc asymmetry properties, and discuss the potential origins of debris disc asymmetries.** We utilised empirical methods to identify emission asymmetries** and the presence of offset emission between disc centres and the locations of the host stars, via an analysis of their calibration procedures and disc properties. We associated observational asymmetry types** and plausible physical classes** associated with each source. We show that there are ten systems, almost half of the ARKS sample, that host either a continuum emission asymmetry or offset emission. Three systems host offsets (HD15115, HD32297, and HD109573 (HR4796)), four host azimuthal asymmetries (HD9672 (49Ceti), HD92945, HD107146, and HD121617), two host an asymmetry in their major axis (HD10647 (q$^1$ Eri), and HD39060 ($\beta$ Pic)), and one hosts an asymmetry in their minor axis (HD61005). We attribute the offset asymmetries to non-zero eccentricities, and three of the azimuthal asymmetries to arcs. The presence of an asymmetry or offset in the ARKS sample appears to be correlated with the fractional luminosity of cold dust.** Conclusions: This study demonstrates that debris disc asymmetries in the ARKS sample are common, and plausibly so in the wider population of debris discs at (sub)-millimetre wavelengths.** ** = ABRIDGED FOR ARXIV: FULL ABSTRACT IN PAPER</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Multi-Wavelength Study of Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF): Complementary ALMA and JWST Investigations of Water and Methanol in Cometary Comae</a><span class="id">[2601.11767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period comets, which are often considered to be representative of material in the protoplanetary disk that formed the Solar System, are ideal to investigate the question of chemical inheritance in astronomy. Determining the chemistry of comets, both individually and as a population, has become of great importance in comparative studies against sources representative of evolutionary precursors to planetary systems. Contemporaneous observations of long-period comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) were obtained with the JWST and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in early 2023 March. This work focuses on \ce{CH3OH} measurements from both ALMA and JWST as well as \ce{H2O} measurements from JWST. Radiative transfer modeling of \ce{CH3OH} and \ce{H2O} was performed to investigate spatial variations in rotational temperature, column density, and production rates, as well as a comparison of derived values between the two telescopes. Most of the spatial distributions of the modeled values are centrally peaked, and the modeled values from JWST are all within the error bars of the average values from ALMA. C/2022 E3 (ZTF) also displays an enhancement in modeled rotational temperature in the anti-Sunward direction that is shown to be statistically significant. Based on non-LTE radiative transfer modeling, the declining \ce{H2O} rotational temperatures as a function of nucleocentric distance observed by JWST can be explained primarily as a result of rotational line cooling. The values derived in this work are in general agreement with single-dish millimeter-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11784" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Einstein Probe discovery of EP J171159.4-333253: an eclipsing neutron star low-mass X-ray binary with clocked bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.11784]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>EP J171159.4-333253 is a new neutron-star low-mass X-ray binary discovered in outburst by the Einstein Probe (EP) on 2025 June 23, exhibiting clocked type-I X-ray bursts, eclipses and dips. In this paper, we report on the results of the X-ray spectral and timing analyses for EP J171159.4-333253 using data collected by EP and NuSTAR during the first 21 days of the outburst. The X-ray burst recurrence time can be characterized over a subset of nine bursts spanning 1.6 days around the NuSTAR observation, and the result is $t_{\rm rec}=8196 \pm 177\,$s with indications of a possible decreasing trend. From the X-ray eclipse events, the binary orbital period and the eclipse duration are estimated to be $P_{\rm orb}=6.48301 \pm 0.00003\,$hr and $D_{\star,X} = 1245.5^{+6.9}_{-6.5}\,$s, respectively. These enable an estimate of the mass and radius of the companion star and the binary inclination, which are $M_2\approx0.6-0.8\,M_\odot$, $R_2\approx0.7-0.8\,R_\odot$ and $i\approx73-75^\circ$, respectively. We also report on joint ULTRACAM and EP observations on 2025 July 21–22, detecting the source optical counterpart and covering an eclipse in both X-ray and optical bands. The optical eclipse is wavelength-dependent and broader than in X-rays, indicating that part of the optical emission arises from an extended region in the accretion flow. Despite a moderate variation in the source flux, the properties of the persistent X-ray emission are typical of a hard spectral state. We further evaluated the ratio of the accretion energy to the thermonuclear energy to be 120–130, implying helium bursts with the accreted hydrogen being depleted in-between bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Increased and Varied Radiation during the Sun's Encounters with Cold Clouds in the last 10 million years</a><span class="id">[2601.11785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent research raises the possibility that 3 and 7 million years ago, the Sun encountered massive clouds that shrank the heliosphere–the solar cocoon protecting our solar system–exposing Earth to its interstellar environment, in agreement with geological evidence from 60Fe and 244Pu isotopes. Here we show that during such encounters Earth was exposed to increased radiation in the form of high-energy particles. During periods of Earth's immersion in the heliosphere, it received particle radiation that we name Heliospheric Energetic Particles (HEPs). The intensity of &lt; 10 MeV protons was at least an order of magnitude more intense than today's most extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events. SEPs today last minutes to hours, but HEP exposure then lasted for extensive periods of several months, making it a prolonged external driver. During Earth's excursion outside the heliosphere, it was exposed to a galactic cosmic ray radiation with the intensity of &lt; 1 GeV protons at least an order of magnitude more intense than today. Therefore, the space surrounding Earth was permeated by a variable high-energy radiation. We discuss the implications for Earth's climate and biodiversity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11824" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) VII: Optically thick gas with broad CO gaussian local line profiles in the HD 121617 disc</a><span class="id">[2601.11824]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CO gas has been detected in $\sim$20 debris discs. We present ALMA observations of the CO-rich HD 121617 debris disc from the ARKS survey. Using high-resolution Band 7 observations of $^{12}CO \ J=3-2$, we analyse local CO line profiles to investigate optical depth, CO mass, and temperature. Spectra are aligned and stacked in concentric annuli to produce local line profiles. The resulting profiles are Gaussian-shaped and broadened by Keplerian shear. The line profiles are modelled using both a simplified toy model and a RADMC-3D model including projection effects and Keplerian shear. Fitting the RADMC-3D model to the $^{13}$CO data, we find that an optically thick model with a temperature of 38 K and a CO mass of $2 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\oplus}$ reproduces the observations. The model reproduces the enhanced emission at orbital azimuths of $\sim \pm45^{\circ}$ and $\pm135^{\circ}$, forming an X-shaped structure in the velocity-integrated intensity map, as well as the broader $^{12}$CO linewidth relative to $^{13}$CO. Scaling the model by the ISM abundance ratio ($\sim$77) also reproduces the $^{12}$CO data, though high optical depths and model assumptions limit mass constraints. We find that azimuthally averaged local line profiles appear Gaussian regardless of optical depth, cautioning against their use for distinguishing optically thin and thick emission. We constrain the mean molecular weight to $12.6_{-1.1}^{+1.3}$, dependent on model assumptions. Our $^{13}$CO results suggest that C$^{18}$O may also be optically thick in CO-rich debris discs and that the mean molecular weight is significantly higher than if H$_2$ were the dominant gas species, suggesting a non-primordial composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quiet, but not silent. The X-ray activity of the Maunder minimum star HD 166620</a><span class="id">[2601.11853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the only known unambiguous star in a Maunder minimum-like chromospheric activity state, the properties of HD 166620 can provide valuable insight into the behaviour of the Sun during the historic extended low-states of its activity cycle. The coronal X-ray activity of HD 166620 has so far only been probed with a ROSAT/HRI observation in 1996, near the chromospheric activity maximum before the star entered its grand minimum around 2004. We conducted a deep {\it XMM-Newton} observation of HD 166620 during its chromospheric Ca II H&amp;K activity grand minimum to achieve a better understanding of its magnetic activity. We detected HD 166620 with an X-ray luminosity of ${{\rm log}\,L_{\rm X}\,\rm{(erg\,s^{-1})}=26.56^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$, corresponding to ${{\rm log}\,(L_{\rm X}/L_{\rm bol}) = -6.58^{+0.10}_{-0.12}}$ and an X-ray surface flux of log Fx (erg/cm^2/s) = 3.97+0.10-0.12. With respect to the earlier ROSAT observation, the X-ray brightness of HD 166620 has decreased by a factor of 2.5 during its Maunder minimum-like state. To place its X-ray properties into context, we constructed an X-ray sample of late-type stars within 10 pc of the Sun. The activity of HD 166620 is below the levels of all other K dwarfs in the 10 pc sample. The corona of HD 166620 during its grand minimum emits at the level of the solar background corona, which implies that it has no large active magnetic structures. Along with long-term Ca II H&amp;K monitoring of HD 166620, this result provides evidence that the solar activity during the Maunder minimum was not reduced significantly below the levels seen during its present-day cycle minima. The similar X-ray surface flux of HD 166620 and the modern quiet Sun, and also their Rossby number near the critical value of spin-down models, suggest a connection between the regime of weakened magnetic braking and the occurrence of Maunder minimum states.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Mining-Based Cislunar Escape-Family Analysis in The Multi-Body Models</a><span class="id">[2601.11881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Escape trajectories from the Earth-Moon system play an important role in interplanetary transfer. This paper focuses on the escape trajectories from a 167 km circular Earth orbit in the Earth-Moon planar circular three-body problem and the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular four-body problem and is denoted to providing a comprehensive analysis on these escape trajectories. To achieve these purposes, the global maps of escape trajectories are constructed, and escape trajectories with one lunar gravity assist are pre-filtered. Then, an effective method to identification escape families is proposed based on dynamical analysis and data mining techniques. Once the escape families are identified, the corresponding characteristics are analyzed to provide insights into the construction of escape trajectories. Based on these escape families, the effects of the solar gravity perturbation on the number of escape trajectories, the emergence and disappearance of escape families, variation in generalized energy, and transfer characteristics are further summarized, providing insights into the model selection in the escape trajectory construction. This paper establishes an analysis methodology of escape trajectories from a perspective of escape families, deepening the understanding of escape dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11887" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prediction of Multi-Wavelength Afterglows Associated with FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A</a><span class="id">[2601.11887]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are mysterious radio transients with uncertain origins and environments. Recent studies suggest that some active FRBs may originate from compact objects in binary systems. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework to model the multi-wavelength afterglows of FRBs resided in binary systems and apply it to two representative repeaters, FRB 20200120E and FRB 20201124A. By solving the dynamics and radiation processes of FRB ejecta interacting with the surrounding medium, we compute afterglow light curves in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands. Our results show that radio afterglows offer the best prospects for detection, with their brightness highly sensitive to ejecta kinetic energy and ambient density. Future high-sensitivity radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), could detect these signals. Optical afterglows, though short-lived and challenging to observe, may be significantly enhanced in dense environments, potentially making them detectable with facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In contrast, X-ray afterglows are predicted to be too faint for detection with current instruments.

We investigate the possible afterglow of FRB 20171020A, a rare nearby and bright FRB localized in a galaxy at only 37 Mpc. Assuming that this source produces a future bright burst, we model the expected afterglow emission in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands under both uniform and wind-like ambient media, within the framework of the magnetar model. Our results show that the optical afterglow is the most promising for detection, but it fades rapidly and requires follow-up within a few hundred seconds post-burst. The radio afterglow may be detectable under favorable conditions in a dense stellar wind, whereas the X-ray counterpart is too faint for current telescopes. These findings suggest that rapid optical follow-up offers the best opportunity to detect the afterglow of the next bright burst from FRB 20171020A, providing unique insights into the progenitor and its environment. To assess observational feasibility, we estimate the event rate of nearby FRBs with sufficient energy to power detectable afterglows, finding a rate of $\sim$0.3 per year for CHIME surveys. Although this rate is low and the optical detection timescale is short, coordinated fast-response strategies using global telescope networks could significantly improve the chance of success. As more nearby FRBs are discovered, multi-wavelength observations will be essential in unveiling the physical nature of these enigmatic events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11917" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for 1.01 s Pulsations of the Central Compact Object in the Supernova Remnant RCW 103 with ASCA, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR</a><span class="id">[2601.11917]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The neutron-star X-ray source 1E 161348-5055, associated with the supernova remnant RCW 103, exhibits clear intensity variations with a period of 6.67 hr. To clarify the nature of this object and its long periodicity, detailed timing studies were applied to its archival X-ray data, taken with ASCA (in 1993), XMM-Newton (in 2001, 2005, and 2016), and NuSTAR (2016 and 2017). It was assumed that the 6.67 hr period arises due to the beat between the rotation and free precession periods of the star that is slightly aspherical. By removing timing perturbations to be caused by this long periodicity, the six data sets consistently yielded evidence for pulsations at periods of P 1.01 s, to be interpreted as the objects' spin period, although the optimum energy range differed among the data sets. The measured six periods accurately line up on a linear spin-down trend of dP/dt = 1.097x 10^{-12} s/s. The object is implied to have a characteristic age of 14.7 kyr, a spin-down luminosity of 4.2x10^{34} erg/s, which is insufficient to power the X-ray luminosity, a dipole magnetic field of  4.6x10^{13} G, and a toroidal field of  7 x10^{15} G. Its similarity and dissimilarity to magnetars are discussed. An emission geometry, which crudely explain these results, is presented.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Captured are circularized: A relativistic treatment of extreme mass ratio inspirals crossing accretion disks</a><span class="id">[2601.11925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A small body orbiting around an accreting massive object and periodically crossing its accretion disk is a common configuration in astrophysics. In this work, we investigate the secular evolution of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass object (SMO), e.g., a star or a stellar-mass black hole (sBH), collides with the accretion disk of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH), within a fully relativistic framework. We find (1) the disk always tends to align the SMO no matter what the initial orbital inclination $\iota$ relative to the disk is, (2) the final orbital eccentricity of the SMO captured by the disk is always low though the orbital eccentricity may temporarily grow when the orbital inclination $\iota$ is large and the SMO is an sBH, and (3) via collisions with the accretion disk only, only a small fraction of sBHs that are initially close to the SMBH and close to the disk can be captured by the disk within typical disk lifetime of active galactic nuclei. Two-body scatterings between SMOs in the nuclear stellar cluster play an essential role in randomly kicking sBHs towards the disk and boosting the capture rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Dynamo Confinement Scenario for the Solar Tachocline and its Implications for Spin-down in the Radiative Spreading Regime</a><span class="id">[2601.11943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At the base of the Sun's convective zone, a narrow shear layer called the tachocline separates strong latitudinal differential rotation above from nearly rigid rotation in the radiative zone below. The observed thinness of the tachocline is a long-standing dynamical puzzle because the tachocline should have spread significantly due to inward-burrowing meridional circulation, also called &quot;radiative spreading.&quot; We recently presented the first pair of global simulations to reveal a statistically stationary tachocline confined against radiative spreading by the Maxwell stresses from the nonaxisymmetric modes of a dynamo, which penetrated into and below the tachocline through a novel magnetic skin effect. In the work presented here, we systematically examine how this &quot;dynamo confinement scenario&quot; works against radiative spreading in a suite of simulations as the governing parameters trend in the direction of the true solar regime. We find that as the stable stratification of the radiative zone is made progressively stronger, the dynamo cycles get longer, the magnetic field consequently penetrates deeper due to the skin effect, and the tachocline becomes more confined. Furthermore, these results have interesting consequences for solar spin-down. In all of our radiatively spreading simulations, the tachocline region spins down due to the burrowing circulation. Below the tachocline, the Maxwell stresses transmit this spin-down further to rigidify the deeper radiative zone. We thus speculate that, in addition to confining the tachocline, the dynamo may provide a pathway to communicate spin-down from the near-surface layers to the deep interior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11950" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pushchino Multibeam Pulsar Search.

The objectives are to determine the positions and stability of the equilibrium points, asses how these points shift under the influence of perturbations, and evaluate the dependence of their stability on the orbital eccentricity and perturbation parameters. The ERTBP model is modified to include a radiating, oblate primary body and an elongated secondary body modeled as a finite straight segment, alongside perturbations from a surrounding disk. The system's equations of motion are numerically solved using parameters from perturbed and classical cases. Equilibrium positions are computed over a range of eccentricities and perturbation values, and stability is analyzed using linearized equations and eigenvalue methods. In all cases, we have found three collinear ($L_1$, $L_2$, $L_3$) and two non-collinear ($L_4$, $L_5$) equilibrium points solutions. The inclusion of radiations, oblateness, elongation using a finite straight segment, and disk perturbation systematically displaces each equilibrium point from its classical location, with the magnitude and direction of the displacement varying with the perturbation parameter. Stability analysis confirms that the collinear points remain linearly stable under all tested conditions. Meanwhile, non-collinear points are stable under a specific condition. We investigate the stability boundary of these points as a function of orbital eccentricity and we found there is a critical range of eccentricity values within which stability is preserved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12074" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interior dynamics of envelopes around disk-embedded planets</a><span class="id">[2601.12074]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the core accretion scenario, forming planets start to acquire gaseous envelopes while accreting solids. Conventional one-dimensional models assume envelopes to be static and isolated. However, recent three-dimensional simulations demonstrate dynamic gas exchange from the envelope to the surrounding disk. This process is controlled by the balance between heating, through the accretion of solids, and cooling, which is regulated by poorly-known opacities. In this work, we systemically investigate a wide range of cooling and heating rates, using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We identify three distinct cooling regimes. Fast-cooling envelopes ($\beta \lesssim 1$, with $\beta$ the cooling time in units of orbital time) are nearly isothermal and have inner radiative layers that are shielded from recycling flows. In contrast, slow cooling envelopes ($\beta\gtrsim10^3$) become fully convective. In the intermediate regime ($1\lesssim\beta\lesssim300$), envelopes are characterized by a three-layer structure, comprising an inner convective, a middle radiative, and an outer recycling layer. The development of this radiative layer traps small dust and vapour released from sublimated species. In contrast, fully convective envelopes efficiently exchange material from inner to outer envelope. Such fully convective envelopes are likely to emerge in the inner parts of protoplanetary disks ($\lesssim$ 1 au) where cooling times are long, implying that inner-disk super-Earths may see their growth stalled and be volatile depleted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of a Millisecond Periodicity in BATSE Short Gamma-Ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.12108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Coherent oscillations at kilohertz frequencies have recently been detected in a small number of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), suggesting quasi-periodic dynamics in their central engines. A prominent example is GRB 230307A, which exhibited a brief, highly coherent, energy-dependent periodic signal interpreted as the possible spin signature of a nascent millisecond magnetar formed after a compact binary merger. Motivated by these developments, we conducted a comprehensive search for similar signals, accounting for both temporal and spectral dependencies, in 532 short GRBs with time-tagged event data recorded by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) onboard the \textit{Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory}. Within this sample, we identify a single statistically significant case: GRB 960616 (BATSE trigger 5502), in which the $\sim$30 ms main emission episode is coherently modulated at 1100 Hz, with the strongest modulation above 320 keV and a fractional amplitude of $\sim$47\%. Assuming the presence of a coherent periodic modulation, we use data-driven Monte Carlo simulations to place an upper limit of $\sim$8\% on the fraction of the total radiated energy that can be modulated by the QPO. This event, exhibiting a periodicity at $\sim$0.91 ms, further supports the possibility that millisecond periodicities can arise during GRBs in merger-driven scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timing analysis of a sample of five cataclysmic variable candidates observed by the XMM-Newton satellite</a><span class="id">[2601.12127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intermediate polars are a class of cataclysmic variables in which a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star. The intermediate polar nature confirmation usually derives from the detection of two periods in both $X$-ray and optical photometry. In this respect, the high energy signal is often characterized by modulations on the white dwarf spin and the orbital period. However, noting that the periodograms may be characterized by strong features also at the synodic period and/or other sidebands, the timing analysis of the $X$-ray signal may offer the unique possibility to firmly discover an intermediate polar candidate. Here, we concentrate on a sample of five cataclysmic variable {binary} candidates: {i.e. SAXJ1748.2-2808, 1RXS J211336.1+542226, CXOGC J174622.7-285218, CXOGC J174517.4-290650, and V381 Vel, listed in the IPHome catalogue. Our main aim is to confirm if they belong to the intermediate polar class or not. The results of our analysis show that we can safely assess the intermediate polar nature of all the considered sources, apart for the case of V381 Vel which instead behaves like a cataclysmic variable of the polar subclass.

Millimeter-wavelength observations are particularly important, as the grains probed by these observations are not strongly affected by radiation pressure and stellar winds, allowing them to probe the dynamics of large bodies producing dust. The ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) is analyzing high-resolution observations of 24 debris disks to enable the characterization of debris disk substructures across a large sample for the first time. For the most highly inclined disks, it is possible to recover the vertical structure of the disk. We aim to model and analyze the most highly inclined systems in the ARKS sample in order to uniformly extract the vertical dust distributions for a sample of well-resolved debris disks. We employed both parametric and nonparametric methods to constrain the vertical dust distributions for the most highly inclined ARKS targets. We find a broad range of aspect ratios, revealing a wide diversity in vertical structure, with a range of best-fit parametric values of $0.0026 \leq h_{\rm HWHM} \leq 0.193$ and a median best-fit value of $h_{\rm HWHM}=0.021$. The results obtained by nonparametric modeling are generally consistent with the parametric modeling results. We find that five of the 13 disks are consistent with having total disk masses less than that of Neptune (17 $M_{\oplus}$), assuming stirring by internal processes (self-stirring and collisional and frictional damping). Furthermore, most systems show a significant preference for a Lorentzian vertical profile rather than a Gaussian.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Superfluid Angular Momentum Reservoir Effect on Pulsar Glitches and Forecasting Next Glitches of the Crab Pulsar</a><span class="id">[2601.12130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar glitches are generally viewed as stochastic events driven by sudden angular momentum transfer from the neutron star's superfluid interior to its crust. Except two peculiar pulsars with quasi-periodic glitches, this stochastic view has prevailed. Here, by clustering temporally proximate small glitches of the Crab pulsar, we uncover clear evidence of an underlying quasi-periodic modulation, challenging the paradigm of purely random behavior. Furthermore, our correlation analyses reveal a strong positive relationship between glitch cluster size and waiting time since the preceding clusters. These findings demonstrate the effect of angular momentum reservoir operating over long-term scales and enable the predictions of next glitching window. Remarkably, two minor glitches detected in July and August 2025, which align with our initial prediction made in June, should be confirmed as the onset of this predicted activity. Inspired by the initial success, we forecast the occurrence of a major glitch from now until August 2026, with possible glitch size up to a relative change in rotational frequency of $697.2 \times 10^{-9}$. Physically, the observed long-term quasi-periodicity and cluster size-waiting time correlations imply that each glitch event releases only a fraction of the stored superfluid angular momentum. This partial-release mechanism provides a unified framework for both stochastic and quasi-periodic glitch behaviors across different pulsars, underscoring the universality of the superfluid angular momentum reservoir effect. As the most intensively monitored object, the Crab pulsar serves as a natural laboratory for studying angular momentum inside neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a soft X-ray lag in the tidal disruption event AT2021ehb</a><span class="id">[2601.12240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this Letter, we report the detection of soft X-ray time lags-i.e. variability in the softer photons lagging behind that in the harder photons-in seven XMM-Newton observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT2021ehb. We find correlated variability between the soft (0.3-0.7 keV) and hard (0.9-10 keV) bands on about 10^4 s time-scales, and measure a soft lag of about 500 s. This behaviour is broadly consistent with the disk-corona reverberation scenario established in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Together with the previously reported strong hard X-ray emission and broad Fe K line, our results suggest the presence of a compact corona and prominent relativistic disk reflection in AT2021ehb. The unusually high blackbody temperature (peaking at about 200 eV) is difficult to reconcile with thermal emission from a standard accretion disk around a about 10^7 Msun black hole, and may instead be analogous to the soft excess commonly observed in AGNs, whose physical origin remains debated. Finally, the measured lags offer a possible explanation for the rapid X-ray flux decline that occurred only three days after the peak, pointing to a scenario in which the corona cools following a sudden loss of the magnetic support required to sustain it.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the exoplanet radius valley with host stars from SWEET-Cat</a><span class="id">[2601.12396]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radius valley,a deficit of planets near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$, was observed among exoplanets of radius $\lesssim$ 5 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ with periods $&lt;$ 100 days by NASA's $Kepler$ mission. It separates super-Earths (rocky, $\lesssim 1.9$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) from sub-Neptunes (volatile-rich, $\gtrsim 2$ $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$) and may arise from formation conditions or atmospheric loss. Disentangling these mechanisms has led to numerous studies of population-level trends, although the resulting interpretations remain sensitive to sample selection and the robustness of host-star parameters. We re-examine its existence, depth, and dependence on period, flux, stellar mass, and age. Using SWEET-Cat and MAISTEP tool, we derived stellar parameters for 1,221 main-sequence stars (1,405 planets), with effective temperatures 4400–7500 K and radii 0.62–2.75 $\mathrm{R_{\odot}}$, achieving 2\% precision in radius and mass. Planetary radii were recomputed from radius ratios, yielding 5\% median uncertainty. The valley is partially filled near 2 $\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and depends on period, flux, and stellar mass, with slopes $-0.12^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$, $0.10^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, and $0.19^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$. Sub-Neptunes show a stronger stellar mass-dependent trend than super-Earths ($0.17^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ vs $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$). With stellar age, the super-Earth/sub-Neptune ratio rises from $0.51^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$ ($&lt;3$ Gyr) to $0.64^{+0.11}_{-0.11}$ ($\gtrsim3$ Gyr), and the valley becomes shallower and shifts to larger radii. A 4D fit shows consistent slopes with 2D analyses and a weaker age trend ($0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$). These results suggest prolonged atmospheric loss, which is consistent with a core-powered mass loss scenario and emphasize the need for improved determinations, a goal expected to be achieved by future missions like PLATO.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Circumstellar Material and Shock Acceleration in Core-Collapse Supernovae with High-Energy Neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2601.12417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study high-energy (HE) neutrino production from interactions between supernova (SN) ejecta and the surrounding circumstellar material (CSM), focusing on regular Type II and Type IIn SNe.

We present a multiwavelength analysis covering 15 years of data, from August 2008 to March 2024, to contextualize this period of extreme gamma-ray activity within the long-term emission of the source. We analyzed a long-term, comprehensive, multiwavelength dataset from different facilities and projects from radio to gamma-rays. We identified the 7 most intense gamma-ray flaring periods and performed a kinematic analysis of Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) data to determine whether new jet components emerged before or during these flares. For 2 of these flaring periods, we performed the modeling of the spectral energy distribution (SED). The VLBA-BU-BLAZAR and MOJAVE datasets reveal a new jet component appearing in both visibility datasets prior to the onset of one of the strongest gamma-ray flares. By comparing the timing of the VLBA-BU-BLAZAR knots ejection with the gamma-ray flaring periods, we constrained the setup of the SED modeling. We also found that the first gamma-ray flaring period is less Compton-dominated than the others. Our results suggest that the recent activity of OP 313 is triggered by new jet components emerging from the core and interacting with a standing shock. The {\gamma}-ray emission likely arises from dusty torus photons upscattered via Inverse Compton (IC) by relativistic jet electrons. The SED modeling indicates that this component is less dominant during the first {\gamma}-ray flaring period than the later ones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of energy conversion in weakly collisional plasma during an interplanetary coronal mass ejection</a><span class="id">[2601.12476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intervals of enhanced turbulent fluctuations are typically less frequent within the magnetic cloud region of an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME).

Particle beam experiments at accelerator facilities above and deep underground simulate stellar reactions, new experimental facilities and methods complement these, and this is further complemented by improved theoretical tools to calculate the quantum effects of nuclear reactions at the various cosmic conditions. Astronomical signatures of cosmic nuclear reactions are deduced from light curves characterizing cosmic explosions through gamma-ray lines and presolar grains to the detection of rare neutrino particles from our Sun to distant cosmic events. High resolution spectroscopy of stars has been expanded to objects measured in the X-ray and the gamma energy range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Astro-seismology and isotopic analysis of meteoritic inclusions provide new tools. Chemical-evolution models describe the complex dynamics during the evolution of galaxies. This article summarizes the experimental and theoretical work, and the broad range of observational tools that test the experimental data and the theoretical interpretation of nuclear processes in the cosmos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic field detections in massive systems at different stages of interaction</a><span class="id">[2601.12546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite the importance of magnetic fields in massive stars, their origin is widely debated and still not well understood. With the mounting evidence for the importance of studying magnetic fields in interacting massive binary and multiple systems, it appears necessary to investigate the presence of magnetic fields in semi-detached systems with ongoing mass transfer, and in contact systems where mass is actively being exchanged. We present an analysis of 53 high-resolution HARPSpol spectropolarimetric observations of a sample of 14 massive binary and multiple systems using the least-squares deconvolution technique. The majority of the studied systems are classified as semi-detached or contact binaries. Definite detections of the presence of a magnetic field are achieved in all studied systems apart from the rather faint system SV Cen, for which only a marginal detection was obtained. The fact that the presence of magnetic fields is detected in all but one of the studied systems strongly suggests that interaction between the system components plays a definite role in the generation of magnetic fields in massive stars. The measured mean longitudinal magnetic field strength for all targets is of the order of a few hundred Gauss to a few kiloGauss. The strongest longitudinal magnetic fields of 4 to 5kG are discovered in the massive O-type triple system MY Ser in both components of the contact binary. kiloGauss-order magnetic fields are also detected in two other systems, V1294 Sco and V606 Cen. It is possible that there is an implication of some system characteristics, such as multiplicity, the mass ratio between the components, and a large fillout factor, on the measured magnetic field strength. Our results for the magnetic field measurements in interacting binaries present the first assessment of the occurrence rate of magnetic fields in a representative sample of such systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytic Modeling of Tidally Locked Rocky Planet Atmospheres Across Dynamical Regimes</a><span class="id">[2601.12556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new first-principles analytic approach to interpreting eclipses and phase curves of rocky planets. Observations with JWST have reported nondetections of atmospheres around the majority of hot rocky planets orbiting M dwarfs. However, most of these &quot;bare rock&quot; inferences are based on models that are ill-suited to many currently observable planets, as they were developed for use on cooler, slower-rotating bodies. In particular, these models rely on the weak temperature gradient assumption, in which rotation is neglected and temperature gradients can be simply related to wind speeds. We find that this assumption may not be valid for over 40% of terrestrials observed with JWST, including TRAPPIST-1b, GJ 367b, and TOI-2445b. Our simple new four-box model does not rely on this assumption, and instead allows the heat transport efficiency to be specified or follow scalings derived herein. This method is fast, interpretable, physically motivated, reproduces previous general circulation model results, and can be used as a starting point for more detailed modeling. We observe that the longitudinal temperature structure of tidally locked terrestrials depends strongly on the atmospheric circulation. Considering the applicable range of atmospheric dynamical regimes, we find that a given planet's nightside temperature can plausibly vary by 100s of Kelvin (from detectable to undetectable). Furthermore, a planet's dayside energy balance can display complex behavior, with degeneracies between surface pressure and dayside temperature. Illustrating an application to observations, we find that assumptions about atmospheric dynamics and longitudinal temperature structure can bias atmospheric constraints at the order-of-magnitude level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clouds and Chemistry Across the Brown Dwarf T-Y Sequence: Insights from JWST Atmospheric Retrievals</a><span class="id">[2601.12575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers exceptional spectral resolution and wavelength coverage, which are essential for studying the coldest brown dwarfs, particularly Y dwarfs. These objects are at the cold end of the sub-stellar sequence and exhibit atmospheric phenomena such as cloud formation, chemical disequilibrium, and radiative-convective coupling. We examine a curated sample of 22 late-T to Y dwarfs through Bayesian atmospheric retrieval (nested sampling) and supervised machine learning (random forests). Bayesian model comparison indicates that cloud-free models are generally favored for the hottest objects in the sample (T6-T8). Conversely, later-type dwarfs exhibit varying preferences, with both gray-cloud and cloud-free models providing comparable fits. The atmospheric parameters retrieved are consistent across the applied methodologies. Evidence of vertical mixing and disequilibrium chemistry is found in several objects; notably, the Y1 dwarf WISEPAJ1541-22 favors a gray cloud model and shows elevated abundances of both CO and CO2 compared to equilibrium chemistry calculations. As anticipated, the abundances of H2O, CH4, and NH3 increase with decreasing effective temperature over the T-Y sequence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12578" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the accuracy of mass and size measurements of young protoplanetary disks</a><span class="id">[2601.12578]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Knowing the masses and sizes of protoplanetary disks is of fundamental importance for the contemporary theories of planet formation. However, their measurements are associated with large uncertainties. In this proof of concept study, we focus on the very early stages of disk evolution, concurrent with the formation of the protostellar seed, because it is then that the initial conditions for subsequent planet formation are likely established. Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of a protoplanetary disk followed by radiation transfer postprocessing, we constructed synthetic disk images at millimeter wavelengths. We then calculated the synthetic disk radii and masses using an algorithm that is often applied to observations of protoplanetary disks with ALMA, and compared the resulting values with the actual disk mass and size derived directly from hydrodynamic modeling. We paid specific attention to the effects of dust growth on the discrepancy between synthetic and intrinsic disk masses and radii. We find that the dust mass is likely underestimated in Band 6 by factors of 1.4-4.2 when Ossenkopf &amp; Henning opacities and typical dust temperatures are used, but the discrepancy reduces in Band 3, where the dust mass can be even overestimated. Dust growth affects both disk mass and size estimates via the dust-size-dependent opacity, and extremely low values of dust temperature (  several Kelvin) are required to recover the intrinsic dust mass when dust has grown to mm-sized grains and its opacity has increased. Dust mass estimates are weakly sensitive to the distance to the source, while disk radii may be seriously affected. We conclude that the accuracy of measuring the dust mass and disk radius during the formation of a protoplanetary disk also depends on the progress in dust growth.

They have been resolved at high angular resolution at wavelengths spanning the optical to the submillimetre-millimetre regime. Short wavelengths probe the light scattered by such discs, which is dominated by micron-sized dust particles, while millimetre wavelengths probe the thermal emission of millimetre-sized particles. Determining differences in the dust distribution between millimetre- and micron-sized dust is fundamental to revealing the dynamical processes affecting the dust in debris discs. We aim to compare the scattered light from the discs of the ALMA survey to Resolve exoKuiper belt Substructures (ARKS) with the thermal emission probed by ALMA. We focus on the radial distribution of the dust. We used high-contrast scattered light observations obtained with VLT/SPHERE, GPI, and the HST to uniformly study the dust distribution in those systems and compare it to the dust distribution extracted from the ALMA observations carried out in the course of the ARKS project. We also set constraints on the presence of planets by using these high-contrast images combined with exoplanet evolutionary models. 15 of the 24 discs comprising the ARKS sample are detected in scattered light, with TYC9340-437-1 being imaged for the first time at near-infrared wavelengths. For 6 of those 15 discs, the dust surface density seen in scattered light peaks farther out compared to that observed with ALMA. These 6 discs except one are known to also host cold CO gas. Conversely, the systems without significant offsets are not known to host gas, except one. This observational study suggests that the presence of gas in debris discs may affect the small and large grains differently, pushing the small dust to greater distances where the gas is less abundant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DESI Transients Survey: Legacy Classifications and Methodology</a><span class="id">[2601.12611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first systematic spectroscopic observations of extragalactic transients from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), as part of the DESI Transients Survey program.

The stars LAMOST J1132 and LAMOST J0529 have not yet been recorded in the SIMBAD astronomical database. We have investigated their physical properties via methods such as spectral analysis, photometric analysis, and light curve analysis. Based on comprehensive analysis, we conclude that they are two newly discovered binary systems, each consisting of a hot white dwarf and a flaring companion star. Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) spectra indicate that both stars contain hot white dwarfs. The spectral fitting yields $T_{eff}$=53728$\pm$2467 K, log$g$=7.98$\pm$0.08 for LAMOST J1132, and $T_{eff}$=47381$\pm$494 K, log$g$=7.84$\pm$0.05 for LAMOST J0529. The weak neutral metal lines in the LAMOST spectra and the discrepancy between the Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics (GAIA) and LAMOST spectra both indicate that these two sources are likely binary systems. The relatively high flux values for both sources in the near-infrared and mid-infrared bands support our preliminary judgment. The color index in the near-infrared bands suggests that the companion star is K or M type for LAMOST J1132 and M type for LAMOST J0529. Light curve data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) indicate that the companion stars of both sources are stars exhibiting flare activity. The eclipse probability is very low, indicating that these two sources are non-eclipsing binary systems. The physics of binaries is fascinating, and future data from LAMOST Medium Resolution Spectra are expected to enable the detection of magnetic fields in these two hot white dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical Continuum Light Curves and Bolometric Energy Estimates of Solar White-light Flares</a><span class="id">[2601.12709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar white-light flares (WLFs) are solar flares exhibiting enhanced emission in the optical continuum.

Based on the optimized solar WLF identification method, we construct a dataset of optical continuum light curves for 70 solar WLFs using 6173 Å continuum intensity images from the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Moreover, for each solar WLF event, we also provide the location of the white-light emission enhancement signals and key parameters including bolometric energies and durations derived from both the traditional fixed-temperature blackbody model and the refined variable-temperature blackbody model.

We present the first study of an asteroseismic binary system consisting of a core helium-burning red clump (RC) star and a red giant branch (RGB) star. The Kepler target KIC 10841730 is a wide binary (period $2917 \pm 8$ d) that provides ideal conditions to test the accuracy of RC models. While prior studies of RC stars have revealed discrepancies in modelling the period spacings of mixed modes, other model parameters remain largely untested. We perform a detailed modelling analysis using individual mode frequencies and cover a large parameter space in mass, metallicity, He-abundance, mixing length, overshooting, and mass-loss, and we also explore different methods to correct for surface effects. We find two possible results for the red clump models. One solution requires introducing an unexpected offset of the phase shift in the red clump model, yielding an age consistent with the companion star and current masses of $1.01 \pm 0.06$ and $1.08 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$ for the RC and RGB star, respectively. Alternatively, we find that excluding the identification of two questionable radial modes resolves the phase-shift offset issue but results in a higher mass and thus a much younger age for the red clump star, contradicting the age obtained from its companion. We conclude that uncertainties in red clump models affect not only the g-mode period spacings but also the properties of the p modes. We show the power of asteroseismic binaries in validating and constraining stellar models and highlight the need for refining red-clump models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classical Be Stars and Classical Be Star Binaries from LAMOST DR12</a><span class="id">[2601.12789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Classical Be (CBe) stars are rapidly rotating B-type stars with Balmer emission lines that originated from the decretion disks surrounding them in their spectra.

It follows that in most close CBe star binaries, the companions are expected to be post-main-sequence stars rather than main-sequence (MS) stars. Hitherto, $\sim$100 CBe star binaries have been identified, the majority of which are Be/X-ray binaries. As expected, none of the others have indeed been confirmed as CBe+MS binary stars. To further study and verify the origin of CBe stars, identifying additional CBe star binaries is indispensable. In this study, we report 504 CBe stars identified using data from Data Release 12 of the Large sky Area Multi-Object fiber Spectroscopic Telescope. Among these, 141 are newly identified and 14 exhibiting radial velocity variations are identified as CBe star binaries. Besides, 60 CBe stars with high normalized unit weight error (RUWE) but not confirmed by dynamics are proposed as potential CBe star binaries.

Understanding the survival and orbital evolution of brown dwarf (BD) companions during the post-main-sequence (MS) evolution of their host stars is increasingly important, especially with recent discoveries of many substellar companions around white dwarfs (WDs). Aims. We investigate the long-term evolution and final outcomes of BDs orbiting low-mass MS stars as these evolve into WDs. By comparing forward-modeling populations with observed WD-BD binaries, we test evolutionary models and predict the existence of yet-undetected systems. Methods. We employ the COMPAS binary population synthesis code to evolve observed MS-BD systems through the post-MS phases of their host stars into the WD stage, tracking orbital changes driven by mass loss, tides, and common-envelope (CE) evolution. Results. Our simulations reproduce a period gap in the distribution of detached WD-BD binaries, consistent with observations. We also identify a boundary separating detached and semi-detached systems on the period-mass diagram, located at orbital periods of $\sim$1-2 hours depending on the BD mass. Conclusions. We predict that a subset of currently known MS-BD binaries will survive post-MS evolution and emerge as detached WD-BD systems, while others will undergo CE evolution and potentially form cataclysmic variables with BD donors. Our results reproduce the observed period gap in WD-BD binaries and provide quantitative predictions for the role of CE efficiency in shaping their distribution. This work predicts that many WD-BD systems remain undetected, motivating targeted searches with microlensing and high-contrast imaging techniques using next-generation large telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring rotational properties and the YORP effect in asteroid families</a><span class="id">[2601.12972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The long-term dynamical evolution of asteroid families is governed by the interplay between orbital and rotational evolution driven by thermal forces and collision. We aim to observationally trace the rotational evolution of main-belt asteroid families over Gyr timescales. We analyzed rotational properties of 8739 asteroids with spin period measurements and 3794 asteroids with obliquity determinations across 28 asteroid families spanning ages from 14 Myrs to 3 Gyrs. We introduced a dimensionless timescale that normalizes each asteroid's family age by its classical YORP timescale, enabling direct comparison of rotational states across different evolutionary stages. We examined two key observables: the fraction of slow rotators (periods greater than or equal to 30 hours) and the polarization fraction (the degree to which asteroid spin poles align correctly with their position in the family's V-shape distribution according to the Yarkovsky theory). Evolution of both quantities were fitted to identify characteristic transition timescales. We discovered that the slow-rotator fraction increases steeply with $t$ and saturates at $f_{\rm slow} \simeq 0.25$ around a breakpoint $t_{\rm bp} \simeq 20$. This implies a stochastic YORP timescale $\tau_{\rm YORP,stoc} \simeq 10\,\tau_{\rm YORP}$ by comparison with rotational evolution models that include tumbling and weakened YORP torques. The polarization fraction reaches a maximum of $\simeq 0.8$ at $t \simeq 16$ and then decays toward the random limit $f_{\rm pol} \rightarrow 0.5$ for $t \gtrsim 20$, indicating an increasing dominance of collisional spin reorientation over time. The rotation properties within different asteroid families offer crucial clues to rotation evolution and can serve as a new dimension for age estimation of asteroid families with more data in the LSST era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint analysis of small-scale galaxy clustering and galaxy–galaxy lensing from BOSS galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.12976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a joint analysis of galaxy clustering and galaxy–galaxy lensing measurements from BOSS galaxies using a simulation-based emulation method combined with a halo occupation distribution model.

We combine small-scale analysis of clustering from $0.1h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc and lensing from $1.7h^{-1}$Mpc to $60.2~h^{-1}$Mpc to perform cosmological constraints. We split the BOSS galaxies into three redshift bins to measure their clustering and employ galaxies from Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey and Hyper Suprime-Cam as source galaxies to measure lensing separately. We find that the addition of lensing significantly improves the constraining power on $S_{8}=\sigma_8(\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$, with a weak improvement for $f\sigma_{8}$. Our results of $f\sigma_{8}$ indicate tensions of around $1\sim4\sigma$ below the results of CMB observations of Planck. For $S_{8}$, our results are also lower than Planck, and the tension can be mitigated when considering possible systematics in lensing measurement. As a byproduct, our analysis prefers a non-zero neutrino mass but without strong significance, with the constraining power dominated by the clustering.

We examine the signature of the transition as traced through the redshifted 21-cm line with SKA-Low at $3 &lt; z &lt; 7$. To do so, we use the semi-numerical simulation \textsc{21cmFAST} to model the HI during the EoR and add a HI-halo based post-processing model of the late-time HI. This approach gives a robust estimate of the amplitude of the HI temperature field and predicts the observable power spectrum during the transition period. We find that our simulation pipeline reproduces the expected power spectrum trends from existing observations and theory, in addition to replicating current observational constraints on $\Omega_{\text{HI}}$. Our simulations predict a drop in power of four orders of magnitude between $4 &lt; z &lt; 7$. Assuming an inhomogeneous recombination model, we find a flattening of the power due to lingering neutral islands masking the late-time HI signal for $5 &lt; z&lt; 6.5$. Using SKA-Low deep survey parameters, we find HI power spectrum detectability at scales $k \leq 1$ $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for redshifts $3&lt; z &lt; 7$, even when using the horizon limit to mitigate foregrounds. Our results suggest a sufficient SNR of the HI power spectrum tracing the underlying halos $z &lt; 5$, which can be used for late-time cosmology. Our results suggest that the resulting $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ constraints can trace different reionization scenarios such as a decreased escape fraction. This study implies that deep SKA-Low observations for $3&lt; z&lt; 7$ will be an important probe to constrain reionization parameters as well as cosmological models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Was the Early Universe Quantum?

However, the quantum nature of these fluctuations has not been experimentally established, since classical stochastic models could reproduce the observed two-point statistics by construction. Existing approaches to testing primordial quantumness focus primarily on Bell inequalities, which provide a sharp conceptual criterion but are difficult to implement with cosmological observables. In this work we adopt a falsification-based approach. We define a precise classical hypothesis for the origin of primordial perturbations (local stochastic fields admitting a positive probability distribution) and identify inequality constraints that must be satisfied within this class. We show how violations of these classicality inequalities can be probed using realistic cosmological observables, without invoking Bell tests or non-commuting measurement settings. We further identify symmetry-protected spectator sectors in which quantum coherence is parametrically preserved during inflation, allowing violations of observable magnitude to survive decoherence. Our results show that large-scale structure and future 21 cm surveys provide a viable and quantitative route to falsifying classical stochastic descriptions of primordial fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating the quasi-ballistic regime of a short Gamma-Ray Burst jet</a><span class="id">[2601.13056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study extends the 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of a jet emerging from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger presented in Pavan et al.

The physical quantities inferred thus provide reliable inputs for afterglow emission calculations. This work demonstrates a method for simulating jets in 3D up to nearly ballistic regimes that is general and ready to be applied to any jet in a BNS merger context.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOWIE-ALIGN: Sub-solar C/O ratio and metallicity atmosphere of the misaligned hot Jupiter HAT-P-30b</a><span class="id">[2601.13104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectrum of the misaligned hot Jupiter HAT-P-30b from 2.8–5.2 $\mu$m as part of the BOWIE-ALIGN survey, a comparative survey designed to probe the link between planet formation and atmospheric composition in samples of misaligned and aligned hot Jupiters orbiting F-type stars. Through independent data reductions and retrieval analyses, we find evidence for absorption features of H$_2$O and CO$_2$ in the atmosphere of HAT-P-30b. Our retrieved abundances are consistent with equilibrium chemistry, from which we infer a sub-solar C/O ratio (0.16–0.45), and sub-solar and sub-stellar metallicity (0.2–0.8$\times$solar, compared to a stellar metallicity of 1.1–1.6$\times$solar), with muted spectral features. This composition challenges formation models of continuous migration and accretion within a steady disc of stellar metallicity, and could be the result of low C/O ratio gas accretion within the water ice line, low metallicity accretion due to the trapping of volatiles further out in the disc, or the combined accretion of low metallicity gas and carbon-poor solids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal capture and repeating partial tidal disruption events of giant stars</a><span class="id">[2601.13113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass – lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting Continuum Intensity for Solar Active Region Emergence Prediction using Transformers</a><span class="id">[2601.13144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early and accurate prediction of solar active region (AR) emergence is crucial for space weather forecasting. Building on established Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based approaches for forecasting the continuum intensity decrease associated with AR emergence, this work expands the modeling with new architectures and targets. We investigate a sliding-window Transformer architecture to forecast continuum intensity evolution up to 12 hours ahead using data from 46 ARs observed by SDO/HMI. We conduct a systematic ablation study to evaluate two key components: (1) the inclusion of a temporal 1D convolutional (Conv1D) front-end and (2) a novel `Early Detection' architecture featuring attention biases and a timing-aware loss function. Our best-performing model, combining the Early Detection architecture without the Conv1D layer, achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.1189 (representing a 10.6% improvement over the LSTM baseline) and an average advance warning time of 4.73 hours (timing difference of -4.73h), even under a stricter emergence criterion than previous studies. While the Transformer demonstrates superior aggregate timing and accuracy, we note that this high-sensitivity detection comes with increased variance compared to smoother baseline models. However, this volatility is a necessary trade-off for operational warning systems: the model's ability to detect micro-changes in precursor signals enables significantly earlier detection, outweighing the cost of increased noise. Our results demonstrate that Transformer architectures modified with early detection biases, when used without temporal smoothing layers, provide a high-sensitivity alternative for forecasting AR emergence that prioritizes advance warning over statistical smoothness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SolARED: Solar Active Region Emergence Dataset for Machine Learning Aided Predictions</a><span class="id">[2601.13145]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The development of accurate forecasts of solar eruptive activity has become increasingly important for preventing potential impacts on space technologies and exploration.

The dataset is derived from full-disk maps of the Doppler velocity, magnetic field, and continuum intensity, obtained by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). SolARED includes time series of remapped, tracked, and binned data that characterize the evolution of acoustic power of solar oscillations, unsigned magnetic flux, and continuum intensity for 50 large ARs before, during, and after their emergence on the solar surface, as well as surrounding areas observed on the solar disc between 2010 and 2023. The resulting ML-ready SolARED dataset is designed to support enhancements of predictive capabilities, enabling the development of operational forecasts for the emergence of active regions.

Magnetograms were acquired with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). ARs were separated between three classes: class A - regular ARs (bipoles which follow the empirical rules compatible with the mean field dynamo theory); class B - irregular ARs (“wrong” bipoles and multipolars); class U - unipolar sunspots. An aim of the present study is to explore time variations of a typical unsigned magnetic flux of ARs of different classes. The typical flux was acquired as the mean flux over all ARs of a given class observed during one solar rotation. The time profiles of the mean fluxes for different classes were compared. We found that, except for periods of deep solar minima, the mean flux of B-class ARs always dominate that of A-class ARs, and, what is the most important, the time profile of B-class ARs is highly intermittent versus the rather smooth and quazi-constant A-class profile. Intermittency implies a direct involvement of turbulence. We conclude that, through the entire active phase, the Sun is capable of producing regular moderate ARs at a quazi-constant rate along with the production of large and complex irregular ARs in the very intermittent manner. The result is the first observational evidence for the long-standing speculative assumption on the involvement of the convection zone turbulence into the regular global dynamo-process on a stage of the active regions formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13176" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toward Reliable Interpretations of Small Exoplanet Compositions: Comparisons and Considerations of Equations of State and Materials Used in Common Rocky Planet Models</a><span class="id">[2601.13176]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The bulk compositions of small planets ($R_p&lt; 2 \mathrm{R}_\oplus$) are directly linked to their formation histories, making reliable compositional constraints imperative for testing models of planet formation and evolution. Because exoplanet interiors cannot be directly observed, their make-up must be inferred from mass-radius-composition models that link assumed stellar abundances to the direct observables: planetary mass and radius. There are a variety of such models in the literature, each adopting different equations of state (EOS) to describe the materials' properties at depth and varying assumptions about the minerals present within the planets. These EOS+mineral suites provide the foundations for compositional inferences, but they have not yet been systematically compared. In this work, we review several suites, with a detailed description of the basic structure, mineral physics, and materials within standard small planet models. We show that EOS+mineral suites predict planet densities whose differences are comparable to current observational uncertainties, which present a challenge for robustly interpreting and classifying small planets. We apply a powerful small-planet characterization framework, which illustrates that variations among EOS+mineral suites lead to inconsistent conclusions for both individual planets and sample-level demographics. Our results demonstrate the need for more careful considerations of the materials and EOS used in mass-radius-composition models, especially given the current focus on finding and characterizing potentially habitable rocky planets. We conclude with recommendations for best practices so that future interpretations of small planets and their formation are accurate and consistent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadband Variability Analysis of FSRQ PKS 0402-362 with Indications of Quasi-Periodic Modulation</a><span class="id">[2601.13181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral study of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0402$-$362 using \textit{Fermi}-LAT/Swift-XRT/UVOT observations spanning from MJD 54686-60321. The $\gamma$-ray light curve exhibits multiple phases of enhanced activity, with the fractional variability parameter ($F_{\mathrm{var}}$) showing larger amplitudes at longer timescales, consistent with variability trends observed in other FSRQs. Statistical analysis of the flux and spectral index distributions using the Anderson–Darling test and histogram fitting reveals that both distributions deviate from a single log-normal form and are better represented by a double log-normal profile, indicating two distinct flux states. A search for quasi-periodic oscillations in the $\gamma$-ray emission using the Lomb–Scargle periodogram identified a significant periodic signal at $\sim$413 days with a confidence level exceeding $3\sigma$. However the proximity of the timescale to one year and limited number of observed cycles prevents a definitive interpretation. Broadband spectral energy distributions for six flux states were modeled using a one-zone leptonic framework incorporating synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton (SSC), and external Compton (EC) components. The SEDs are well reproduced with physically reasonable parameters: high-flux states exhibit harder electron spectra and lower magnetic field strengths ($B \sim 0.2--0.6\,\mathrm{G}$), while low-flux states show softer spectra and stronger magnetic fields ($B \sim 1.3\,\mathrm{G}$). The fitted break energy decreases during high-flux states, suggesting enhanced radiative cooling and a transition toward a particle- or kinetic-energy-dominated jet. These trends are consistent with the “harder-when-brighter” behavior commonly observed in blazars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Timescales diagnostics for saving viscous and MHD-driven dusty discs from external photoevaporation</a><span class="id">[2601.13200]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution of protoplanetary discs is a function of their internal processes and of their environment. It is unclear if angular momentum is mainly removed viscously or by magnetic winds, or by a combination of the two. While external photoevaporation is expected to influence disc evolution and dispersal, there are observational limitations towards highly irradiated discs. The interplay between these ingredients and their effect on the gas and dust distributions are poorly understood. We investigate the evolution of both the gaseous and solid components of viscous, MHD-wind or hybrid discs, in combination with external FUV-driven mass loss. We test which combinations of parameters protect discs from external irradiation, allowing the solid component to live long enough to allow planet formation to succeed. We run a suite of 1D simulations of smooth discs with varying initial sizes, levels of viscous and MHD-wind stresses modeled via an $\alpha$ parametrisation, and strengths of the external FUV environment. We track disc radii, various lifetime diagnostics, and the amount of dust removed by the photoevaporative wind, as a function of the underlying parameters. The biggest role in determining the fate of discs is played by a combination of its ability to spread radially outwards and the strength of FUV-driven erosion. While MHD wind-driven discs experience less FUV erosion due to the lack of spread, they do not live for longer compared to viscously evolving discs, especially at low-to-moderate FUV fluxes, while higher fluxes yield disc lifetimes that are insensitive to the disc's angular momentum transport mechanism. For the solid component, the biggest role is played by a combination of inward drift and removal by FUV winds. This points to the importance of other physical ingredients, such as disc substructures, even in highly-irradiated disc regions, in order to retain solids.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An efficient model of cosmology dependence in the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2601.13245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Covariance matrices are essential cosmological probes of fundamental physics, providing information on numerous fundamental physical parameters and varying with any change in the underlying cosmology. However, this cosmology dependence, while providing excellent information, also makes them computationally intensive to compute, as a new covariance matrix must explicitly be calculated for every variation in cosmology before comparisons to observational data can be made. In this paper, we develop an efficient model for estimating the parameter dependence of the covariance matrix of the matter power spectrum by Taylor expanding around a known value of the parameter space. This method allows us to use a relatively small number of input cosmologies, specifically one fiducial cosmology and two further cosmologies for each parameter. We explicitly calculate the covariance matrices for these cosmologies and then develop a new model that allows us to interpolate from these the form of the covariance matrix with a cosmology that is located elsewhere in that given parameter space without explicit perturbation theory calculations. This method speeds up covariance matrix calculations in new cosmologies by orders of magnitude compared to explicit perturbation theory calculations at each point in a given parameter space. Using different approximations, we develop three versions of our interpolated covariance matrix and validate the model by recreating all of our input cosmologies using all three forms, both with and without super-sample covariance corrections in each case, and show that the models provide robust recreations of the original results, with the different approximations being valid in certain regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Occurrence Rate of Nearby Planetary Companions to Hot Jupiters</a><span class="id">[2601.13302]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Of the &gt; 500 confirmed transiting hot jupiters and approximately 2000 additional candidates today, only ten are known to have nearby companion planets. The survival of nearby companions means that these hot jupiters cannot have migrated to their present location via dynamically disruptive high-eccentricity migration but instead have undergone disk migration or formed in situ. The occurrence rate for these nearby companions, therefore, constrains the relative efficiency of different hot jupiter formation pathways. Here, we perform a uniform box least-squares search for nearby transiting companions to hot jupiters in the first five years of TESS data. Accounting for observational completeness and detection efficiency, we arrive at an occurrence rate of $(7.6^{+5.5}_{-3.8})\%$, which is a lower limit on the fraction of hot jupiters that underwent disk migration or in situ formation. Comparing this rate with that derived from transit-timing variation searches suggests that hot jupiters are likely mostly aligned with their nearby companions, but their apparently higher incidence of grazing transits may point to a slight preferential misalignment. We also synthesize evidence that hot jupiters with nearby companions may have cold companions at a rate similar to that of other hot jupiters. Comprehensive transit, radial velocity, and stellar obliquity measurements in hot jupiter systems with nearby companions will be necessary to fully account for the relative prevalence of proposed hot jupiter formation pathways.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13307" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Signatures of Black Hole Spin and Plasma Acceleration in Jet Polarimetry II: Off-Axis Jets</a><span class="id">[2601.13307]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the polarization of optically thin, stationary, axisymmetric black hole jets at scales of order the light cylinder radius.

We show that there is always a radius in the jet at which the polarization transitions from azimuthal to radial; this radius is different along the spine and limb of the jet. We propose metrics that can be used to constrain the black hole spin, inclination angle, and plasma Lorentz factor from these polarimetric signatures, and we discuss the impact of limb-brightening on these measurements. We anticipate that these polarimetric signatures can be studied with current or forthcoming data in M87, NGC 315, NGC 4261, Centaurus A, Cygnus A, and other systems. Observations of the polarization of the base of the counter-jet in higher inclination sources would provide a particularly promising probe of black hole spin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Tracer Cross-Correlations of the Unresolved $γ$-Ray Sky</a><span class="id">[2601.13312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Our understanding of the $\gamma$-ray sky has greatly advanced, yet studying the unresolved $\gamma$-ray background (UGRB) can unveil the nature of the faintest $\gamma$-ray source populations in the Universe.

In this work, we examine the angular correlation between the UGRB and the matter distribution traced by galaxies, using twelve years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations along with three years of Dark Energy Survey (DES) data. We detect a correlation with a signal-to-noise ratio of 7.96, primarily driven by large angular scales. We then perform a multi-tracer analysis that combines this measurement with the cross-correlation between $\gamma$ rays and DES weak lensing. The two single-tracer results are mutually consistent, and their combination yields a total significance of 8.6, firmly establishing the extragalactic origin of the UGRB.

A widely accepted interpretation is that these systems are X-ray binaries accreting matter possibly at super-Eddington rates. In this regime, photon trapping inflates the accretion disk, making it geometrically and optically thick. Radiation-driven winds launched from the supercritical disk form funnel-shaped walls along the symmetry axis. While the apparent X-ray luminosity can exceed the Eddington limit due to geometrical beaming within this funnel, a misalignment with the observer's line of sight strongly suppresses the X-ray emission, rendering the ULX electromagnetically obscured. This work explores the potential for high-energy neutrino production in black hole-hosting ULXs. We model proton acceleration via magnetic reconnection in the region above the super-accreting black hole. Although electromagnetic emission is efficiently absorbed by the dense wind and radiation fields, neutrinos generated from photomeson interactions can escape. Our model self-consistently accounts for energy losses of pions and muons in this environment. The results indicate that misaligned, electromagnetically obscured Galactic ULXs could produce a neutrino flux detectable by instruments like KM3NeT and IceCube within several years of observation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13391" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulence Can Persist in the Inner Regions of Weakly-Ionized Planet Forming Disks</a><span class="id">[2601.13391]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Identifying the mechanisms responsible for angular momentum transport in protoplanetary disks, and the extent to which those mechanisms produce turbulence, is a crucial problem in understanding planet formation. The bulk of the gas in protoplanetary disks is weakly ionized, which leads to the emergence of three non-ideal effects, Ohmic diffusion, ambipolar diffusion, and the Hall effect. These low-ionization processes can in some cases suppress turbulence driven by the magnetorotational instability (MRI). However, it has recently been shown that these non-ideal terms can also affect the dynamics of the gas in fundamentally different ways than simple diffusion. In order to further study the role of low-ionization on disk gas dynamics, we carry out a 3D local shearing box simulation with both Ohmic diffusion and ambipolar diffusion and an additional simulation with the Hall effect included. The strength of each non-ideal term, when present, is representative of gas at a radius of 5 AU in a realistic protoplanetary disk. We find the Hall effect increases the saturation strength of the magnetic field, but does not necessarily drive turbulence, consistent with previous work. However, interactions between ambipolar diffusion and the Keplerian shear lead to the ambipolar diffusion shear instability (ADSI), which can drive the initial growth, not damping, of magnetic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly demonstrates the viability of the ADSI in the non-linear regime within protoplanetary disks. At later times in the disk, the MRI (reduced in strength by ambipolar-diffusion), may also be present in regions of weak magnetic field between strong concentrations of vertical magnetic flux and sustain turbulence locally in protoplanetary disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectures of Exoplanetary Systems.

We present a new model for the exoplanet population observed by Kepler, which is a &quot;hybrid&quot; of a clustered multi-planet model in which the orbital architectures are set by the angular momentum deficit (AMD) stability (He et al. 2020; arXiv:2007.14473 ) and a joint mass-radius-period model involving envelope mass-loss driven by photoevaporation (Neil &amp; Rogers 2020; arXiv:1911.03582 ). We find that the models that produce the deepest radius valleys have a primordial population of planets with initial radii peaking at $\sim 2.1 R_\oplus$, which is subsequently sculpted by photoevaporation into a bimodal distribution of final planet radii. The hybrid model requires strongly clustered initial planet masses in order to match the distributions of the size similarity metrics. Thus, the preference for intra-system radius similarity is well explained by a clustering in the primordial mass distribution. The hybrid model also naturally reproduces the observed radius cliff (steep drop-off beyond $\sim 2.5 R_\oplus$). Our hybrid model is the latest installment of the SysSim forward models, and is the first multi-planet model capable of simultaneously reproducing the observed radius valley and the intra-system size similarity patterns. We compute occurrence rates and fractions of stars with planets for a variety of planet types, and find that the occurrence of Venus and Earth-like planets drops by a factor of $\sim 2$-4 for the hybrid models compared to previous clustered models in which there is no envelope mass-loss.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13538" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIU2Net: weak-lensing mass inversion using deep learning with nested U-structures</a><span class="id">[2601.13538]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the primary goals of next-generation gravitational lensing surveys is to measure the large-scale distribution of dark matter, which requires accurate mass inversion to convert weak-lensing shear maps into convergence (kappa) fields. This work develops a mass inversion method tailored for upcoming space missions such as CSST and Euclid, aiming to recover both the mass distribution and the convergence power spectrum with high fidelity. We introduce MIU2Net, a versatile deep-learning framework for kappa-map reconstruction based on the U2-Net architecture. A new loss function is constructed to jointly estimate the convergence field and its frequency-domain energy distribution, effectively balancing optimal mean squared error and optimal power-spectrum recovery. The method incorporates realistic observational effects into shear fields, including shape noise, reduced shear, and complex masks. Under noise levels anticipated for future space-based lensing surveys, MIU2Net recovers the convergence power spectrum with 4% uncertainties up to l approximately 500, significantly outperforming Wiener filtering and MCALens. Beyond two-point statistics, the method accurately reconstructs the convergence distribution, peak centroid, and peak amplitude. Compared to other learning-based approaches such as DeepMass, MIU2Net reduces the root-mean-square error by 5% without smoothing and by 38% with a 1-arcmin smoothing scale.

Using a sample of 43 pulsars detected in both X-ray and gamma-ray bands, we find that pulsars' gamma-ray luminosity, $L_\gamma$, clearly correlates with the luminosity of non-thermal X-ray emission, $L_{\rm p}$, and anti-correlates with non-thermal X-ray photon index. Other gamma-ray spectral parameters show weaker or negligible correlations. The found relation that $L_\gamma \propto L_{\rm p}^{0.49\pm 0.05}$ implies a certain connection between radiation mechanisms and energy distributions of radiating particles for these high-energy emissions. Pulsars with and without detected thermal emissions seem to show different dependencies in those correlations, suggesting the possible existence of two different kinds of pulsars. The ones without detected thermal emissions may represent a population of pulsars with low surface temperature. The origin and energetics of high-energy emitting electron-positron pairs for this group of pulsars probably do not depend on their surface thermal emissions, while that of the other group do. The low surface temperatures might be evidence for the working of some exotic processes of neutron-star cooling. Similar to $L_{\rm p}$, some tempting relationships are found among each gamma-ray spectral parameter, surface temperature and thermally radiating area radius. It again strengthens the connection between gamma-ray and X-ray emissions from pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Origin of (469219) Kamo`oalewa of Tianwen-2 Mission from the Main-Belt: $ν_6$ Secular Resonance, Flora Family or 3:1 Resonance with Jupiter</a><span class="id">[2601.13585]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>China's Tianwen-2 mission, launched on 29 May 2025, targets the near-Earth object (469219) Kamo`oalewa, an Earth quasi-satellite trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with our planet. Determining the origin of Kamo`oalewa is central to understanding the formation pathways and dynamical evolution of Earth's quasi-satellite population. Here we show a strong possibility of main-belt origin for Kamo`oalewa using long-term dynamical simulations. We examine three candidate source regions: the $\nu_6$ secular resonance ($\nu_6$), the 3:1 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter (3:1J MMR), and the Flora family. A total of 42,825 test particles were integrated over 100 Myr. We find that asteroids from all three regions can be transported onto Kamo`oalewa-like orbits, albeit with markedly different efficiencies. Particles originating near the $\nu_6$ show the highest transfer probability (3.31%), followed by the Flora family (2.54%) and the 3:1J MMR (0.39%). We further identify representative dynamical pathways linking these source regions to Earth quasi-satellite orbits. The Tianwen-2 spacecraft is expected to rendezvous with Kamo`oalewa in 2026, performing close-proximity operations and returning samples. The mission will provide decisive observational constraints on the asteroid's composition and physical properties, offering a critical test of its proposed origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint constraints on cosmic birefringence and early dark energy from ACT, Planck, DESI, and PantheonPlus</a><span class="id">[2601.13624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the increasing number of high-precision astronomical observations, physical quantities that were previously inaccessible to accurate calculations, such as cosmic birefringence, have once again become a focal point of interest. Such phenomena induce a nonvanishing cross-correlation between the $E$- and $B$-mode polarizations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), thereby providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. The Chern-Simons coupling between the scalar field in early dark energy (EDE) models and CMB photons is regarded as a plausible mechanism for generating cosmic birefringence. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) deliver $EB$ measurements at higher multipole moments than those previously achieved by {Planck}, while DESI and PantheonPlus datasets provide new and stringent constraints on the late-time expansion history. Using a joint analysis of {Planck}, DESI DR1, Pantheon+, and ACT data, we perform a full-parameter constraint on the cosmic birefringence effects induced by the EDE-CMB photon coupling. Our results favor a higher Hubble constant, $H_0 = 76.9^{+2.9}_{-2.5}\,\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}$, and a relatively large EDE fraction, $f_{\mathrm{EDE}} = 0.232^{+0.074}_{-0.047}$. By comparing the cosmological evolution of this model across different data combinations, we find that the ACT-$EB$ data combined with {Planck} + DESI + PantheonPlus provide good constraints to both early- and late-Universe observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HD 26172: an active solar-type subgiant in a close binary system</a><span class="id">[2601.13652]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the RS CVn system HD 26172, robustly determining the previously debated evolutionary state of its primary star.

The conclusion of subgiant primary is also supported by the absence of lithium absorption and no observed infrared excess. Using long-term photometry from the KWS survey, we detected a tentative stellar activity cycle of 5635 days with an amplitude of 0.04 mag in HD 26172. Additionally, we identified ten optical flare events exhibiting temporally clustered outburst behavior.

The shock parameters, including the normal speed, oblique angles, compression ratio, and Alfven Mach number, were derived by combining a steady-state solar-wind simulation with the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the shock surface based on multi-view observations. We compared the local shock parameters at the magnetic connecting points with in situ proton intensities and peak spectra to establish the link between shock evolution and SEP characteristics. The shock nose consistently exhibited higher particle-acceleration efficiency with the largest normal speed, compression ratio, and supercritical Alfven Mach number, while the flanks showed delayed transition to supercritical Alfven Mach number with weaker efficiency. The earliest and most rapid proton enhancement of STEREO-B correlated with efficient shock acceleration and prompt magnetic connectivity to the shock. Spectral analysis revealed that proton energy spectra were consistent with the relativistic diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) estimations. The initial shock acceleration began at about 1.4-5 Rsun and caused the widespread longitudinal SEP distribution. The longitudinal dependence of SEP intensity and spectral variations arise from the combined influence of 3D shock properties, magnetic connectivity, and particle transport processes. The agreement between in situ proton indices and relativistic DSA estimations supports DSA in this SEP event and provides insights into the early-stage acceleration at the source region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Still Accelerating: Type Ia supernova cosmology is robust to host galaxy age evolution</a><span class="id">[2601.13785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae are a cornerstone of modern cosmology, providing first evidence for cosmic acceleration and new tests of dark energy. Son et al. 2025 (S25) claim a strong redshift evolution in standardized supernova luminosities driven by supernova progenitor age, with dramatic cosmological implications: rapidly evolving dark energy, decelerating expansion, and a $9\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda$CDM. We show that the underpinning evidence required for this conclusion – the supernova progenitor-age dependence, the redshift-dependent age difference, and their combined impact – is either negligible or relies on effects already corrected for in modern supernova analyses. First, the S25 analysis omits the standard host-galaxy stellar mass correction that captures known environmental dependencies that also correlate with stellar age. Applying this correction to the S25 sample, we find no dependence of standardized supernova brightness on host age. Independent data also show no significant difference at low-redshift in standardized brightness between star-forming galaxies and several Gyr older quiescent galaxies of the same stellar mass. Second, the S25 scenario predicts strong redshift evolution of the host-mass effect. Data from the Dark Energy Survey supernova survey measure evolution of $-0.028 \pm 0.034~\mathrm{mag}\,z^{-1}$, consistent with zero and altering the dark-energy equation-of-state measurement ($w$) by $&lt;$0.01 if included. Third, we demonstrate that the claimed $\sim5$ Gyr progenitor age difference between nearby and distant supernovae is overstated by factors of three to five largely due to a conflation of host galaxy age with supernova progenitor age. We conclude that type Ia supernova cosmology remains robust for current measurements of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Cosmological Signature with Doppler Lensing: Insights from Cosmological Simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.13820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Doppler lensing, a relativistic effect resulting from the peculiar velocities of galaxies along the line of sight, provides insight into the large-scale structure of the Universe. Relativistic simulations are essential for modeling Doppler lensing because they incorporate gravity and motion in spacetime. We compare two relativistic $N$-body simulation frameworks, $\texttt{GEVOLUTION}$ and $\texttt{SCREENING}$, to calculate Doppler lensing convergence in cosmic voids of different sizes and halos of different masses. Our analysis reveals scale-dependent performance: $\texttt{SCREENING}$ shows larger differences in small voids (radius range: 15–25 Mpc/h) with a mean absolute relative difference of 38.5\%, due to linearized dynamics failing in nonlinear regimes. Medium voids (25–35 Mpc/h) show better agreement (9.5\% mean difference). For large voids (35–45 Mpc/h), $\texttt{SCREENING}$ exhibits intermediate differences (16.9\% mean difference) with central instabilities. Moreover, our Doppler convergence analysis with massive halos ($10^{11.5}$–$10^{14} {~h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot}$) demonstrates excellent consistency (1.6–3.6\% mean difference). These findings provide clear guidance for simulation choice: $\texttt{GEVOLUTION}$ is recommended for precision studies critical to $\Lambda$CDM or modified gravity tests, while $\texttt{SCREENING}$ offers a computationally efficient alternative for relativistic treatments with large catalogs of voids and halos, assisting future astrophysical surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Examination of frequency and scale dependence of CMB hemispherical power asymmetry</a><span class="id">[2601.13830]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we revisit the well-known cosmic microwave background (CMB) anomaly referred to as Hemispherical Power Asymmetry (HPA), using CMB temperature maps from the Planck mission public release 4 (PR4) and the WMAP nine-year data release. Employing the Local Variance Estimator (LVE) method, we systematically reexamine the properties of HPA to investigate possible frequency dependence as well as scale dependence in its amplitude and direction. We model the HPA as a scale-dependent dipole modulation following a power-law form, rather than assuming a scale-invariant case. Our analysis incorporates seven cleaned frequency-specific CMB temperature maps from both the Planck and WMAP missions to test the robustness of the observed asymmetry across instruments and frequency channels. We find that the dipolar modulation characteristic of HPA is present in all cases examined, with consistent estimates of the preferred direction and scale-dependent variation in dipole amplitudes. These results support the conclusion that the observed asymmetry is unlikely to arise from instrumental artifacts or data-processing effects, and instead points toward a persistent large-scale feature of the CMB sky with a possible cosmological origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Follow-up of three exocomet-host candidates</a><span class="id">[2601.13850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exocomets are small bodies that evaporate when they approach their host star. They are detected through variability of non-photospheric features with spectroscopy and/or asymmetric transits in time-series photometry. In the past four decades  30 systems have shown such variations, and were therefore classified as exocomet host stars. However, some publications have pointed out mechanisms that might mimic exocometary features, and therefore, careful monitoring is needed to confirm the origin of the observed variability. With this paper we aim to investigate the exocomet nature of the non-photospheric variable features observed in the exocomet candidate stars HD 36546, HD 42111 and HD 85905. All of them have shown some degree of variability, particularly in their Ca II K line. We analysed the non-photospheric Ca II K line features from high-resolution spectra obtained using new NOT/FIES and Mercator/HERMES, and some additional archival spectra of the target stars. The variability was quantified through the changes in the equivalent widths of those features, which are assumed to be of circumstellar origin. Column densities were also estimated for each variable feature. Strong variability was found for HD 85905, consistent with a potential link to exocometary activity. However, the binarity of the system, which we confirmed through interferometric VLTI/PIONIER observations, complicates the interpretation of these signatures and prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions. The remaining two sources do not show any significant variability, but due to the sporadic nature of the exocometary events, we cannot discard the exocomet hypothesis. Further monitoring of the stars will be necessary to carry out a robust determination of the variability patterns and timescales that would completely rule out other scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primitive asteroids in the main belt, Cybele, and Hilda populations from Gaia DR3</a><span class="id">[2601.13925]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primitive asteroids include C-, P-, and D-classes, known to be dark and having spectra mostly featureless. They differ in the spectral slope, which ranges from moderate values for C-types, and progressively increases in P- and D-types, the latter being the reddest. While C- and P-types are commonly observed in the asteroid main belt, D-types are commonly found further from the Sun, in the Cybele, Hilda, and Jupiter Trojans regions, and very few are reported in the main belt. This study aims at characterizing the abundance of primordial and red asteroids, belonging to the P-, D-, and Z-classes in the Mahlke et al. (2022) taxonomy, in the 2-5.2 AU region using the third data release by the Gaia mission spectral catalog, which includes more than 60000 spectrophotometric data of asteroids. We have applied the following methodology to identify primordial asteroids in the catalog: 1) selection of objects with signal to noise ratio greater than 20; 2) albedo value less than 12%; 3) chi-squared fit to automatically identify potential D-, Z-, and P-types using Bus-DeMeo and Mahlke taxonomy; 4) visual inspection of every spectrum to confirm the taxonomic classification. Referring to Mahlke taxonomy, we have found 318 new D-types across the main belt, as well as 124 Z-types, and is in agreement with theoretical estimations. We computed the spectral slope in the visible range (0.55 - 0.81 \mu m). We also have identified 265 P-types in the main belt. For the Cybele and Hilda asteroids, we characterize the taxonomic class of all the bodies with SNR higher than 20 in the Gaia catalog, for a total sample of 193 and 180 asteroids, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secular Evolution of PSR J2021+4026: Long-Term γ-Ray Flux and Spin-Down Variability Beyond State Transitions</a><span class="id">[2601.13940]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PSR J2021+4026 is a remarkable $\gamma$-ray pulsar exhibiting repeated transitions between high $\gamma$-ray flux (HGF) and low $\gamma$-ray flux (LGF) states. With 17-yr Fermi-LAT monitoring, we reveal persistent secular evolution and enhanced spin-down rate variability within individual emission states – beneath the quasi-periodic state transitions. After removing discrete jumps, the jump-corrected flux $\delta F_\gamma$ shows a three-phase evolution: rise ($+2.02^{+0.17}_{-0.15}\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), decline ($-3.72^{+0.34}_{-0.47}\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), and rapid rise ($+14.9^{+6.4}_{-4.4}\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), with all rates quoted relative to the long-term mean flux $\langle F_\gamma \rangle=7.8\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Moreover, the flux of the LGF state is gradually approaching the stable HGF level at a rate of $+0.72 \pm 0.11\%~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$.

Using a quasi-static equilibrium approach, we follow the Kelvin–Helmholtz evolution from hot, lepton-rich matter to a cold, catalyzed quark star. Rotation substantially enhances the maximum stable mass (by up to $\sim 40\%$), equatorial radius, and key rotational observables, with the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energy, $T_{\rm kin}/|W|$, reaching $0.18$–$0.19$ near the Keplerian limit, indicating a heightened susceptibility to gravitational-wave–emitting instabilities. Thermal evolution introduces a clear ordering: all stellar properties peak during the lepton-rich stages and decrease monotonically as the star cools. Compared to hadronic stars, rotating protoquark stars exhibit larger radii, higher moments of inertia, and stronger quadrupolar deformation, producing a distinct signature in the mass–radius–spin plane that can accommodate objects such as HESS J1731–347 and PSR J0740+6620.

SMC X-1 shows unique quasi-periodic flux variability of 40-65$\,$days known as superorbital modulation. To constrain the accretion structure of SMC X-1 based on timing and spectral study, we have analysed X-ray data of SMC X-1 observed by Suzaku and NuSTAR at various epochs between 2011 and 2022. The spectral analysis shows that the hydrogen column density ($N_\mathrm{H}$) increases from $1.1 \times 10^{22}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ to $1.24 \times 10^{23}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ as the flux decreases with the superorbital modulation. The neutral iron K$\alpha$ line at 6.4$\,$keV has a broad width of 0.3$\,$keV, and its equivalent width increases as toward superorbital low states. The line broadening is consistent with Keplerian motion at the inner disc rather than the stellar wind velocity of the donor star. These findings support that the superorbital modulation is a consequence of X-ray attenuation by the warped accretion disc. To test this interpretation, we have conducted photon transport simulations of a system consisting of a neutron star, a warped disc, and optically-thin disc atmosphere. Occultation of the central source by the disc successfully reproduces the observed variations in the equivalent width of neutral iron K$\alpha$ line, pulse profiles, and flux in hard X-rays. Notably, a disc precession angle of approximately $30^\circ$ can account for the observational features. For the radiation pattern of the photon source, the preferred beam width corresponds to a standard deviation of $30^\circ$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery and characterisation of two exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788 with TESS, CHEOPS, and HARPS-N</a><span class="id">[2601.14045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery and characterisation of two transiting exoplanets orbiting the metal-poor, solar-type star TOI-5788.

We obtained 125 radial-velocity spectra from HARPS-N and constrain the masses of TOI-5788 b and c as $3.72\pm0.94\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$ and $6.4\pm1.2\,\mathrm{M_\oplus}$, respectively. Although dynamical analyses indicate that a third planet could exist in a stable orbit between 8 and 14 days, we find no evidence of additional planets. Since the TOI-5788 system is one of the few systems with planets straddling the radius gap, and noting that there are even fewer such systems around metal poor stars, it is a promising system to constrain planet formation theories. We therefore model the interior structures of both planets. We find that TOI-5788 b is consistent with being a rocky planet with almost no envelope, or having an atmosphere of a high mean molecular weight. We find that TOI-5788 c is consistent with both gas-dwarf and water-world hypotheses of mini-Neptune formation. We model the atmospheric evolution history of both planets. Whilst both scenarios are consistent with the atmospheric evolution of TOI-5788 c, the gas-dwarf model is marginally preferred. The results of the atmospheric evolution analysis are not strongly dependent on stellar evolution. This makes the system a promising target to test internal structure and atmospheric evolution models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A</a><span class="id">[2601.14065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion flow around Kerr metric in the infra-red limit of asymptotically safe gravity</a><span class="id">[2601.14113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate accretion disk dynamics and the formation of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the infrared limit around Kerr-like black holes in asymptotically safe gravity. Relativistic hydrodynamic solutions of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion reveal that quantum corrections significantly modify the structure of the shock cone formed around the black hole. The black hole spin controls the asymmetric of the shock cone through frame-dragging effects, whereas the quantum correction parameter softens the effective gravitational potential, resulting in a wider shock opening angle, weaker post-shock compression, and reduced density concentration within the cone. Time-dependent mass accretion rates reveal oscillation modes trapped within the shock cone. The power spectral density (PSD) investigations suggest that these modes naturally generate low-frequency QPOs, whose amplitudes, coherence, and harmonic structure depend on both the spin and the quantum correction parameter. The PSD analyses performed at different radial locations reveal that identical QPO frequencies are obtained in all cases. The numerically detected frequencies result from the excitation of global oscillation modes trapped within the post-shock region. The resulting global modes are found to consist of fundamental frequencies, their associated harmonic overtones, and near-commensurate frequency ratios such as 2:1 and 3:2. Coherent oscillations are enhanced and near-commensurate frequency ratios are produced when moderate rotation and moderate quantum corrections are coupled. Large quantum correction parameters, on the other hand, wash out unique spectral peaks and suppress oscillation amplitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minutes-long soft X-ray prompt emission from a compact object merger</a><span class="id">[2601.14137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact object mergers are multi-messenger sources and progenitors of some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), primarily understood by gamma-ray observations, while poorly constrained in the prompt low-energy phase.

However, these methods lack dynamical validation on the main sequence due to the absence of eclipsing double-lined binary system (SB2) as benchmark objects. By providing the orbital inclination, astrometric binary systems from ESA Gaia DR3 offer an abundant alternative for eclipsing systems. We present KIC693187 as the first SB2, hosting a solar-like oscillating post-main-sequence star with dynamical masses. By combining Gaia astrometry with spectroscopic obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network (LCO), we find $M_1^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.99$\pm$0.05$M_\odot$ and $M_2^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.89$\pm$0.04$M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. Asteroseismic parameters were extracted from photometry of the NASA \Kepler satellite. The mass from individual frequency modeling is $M_1^\mathrm{IF}$=0.92$\pm$0.01$M_\odot$. Taking into account the systematic uncertainty of 0.04$M_\odot$ for best fit models from individual frequency fitting, we find an agreement within 1.2$\sigma$. From scaling relations we obtain a mass range of 0.93 to 0.98$M_\odot$ by using the observed large frequency separations (\dnu) in the scaling relations for the primary. By using standard corrections for departures from the asymptotic regime of \dnu, we obtained a mass range of 0.83 to 1.03$M_\odot$. The upper ends of both ranges agree well with the dynamical mass of the primary. This approach provides the first empirical validation for main-sequence solar-like oscillators and opens a new window for validating asteroseismology. Through a dedicatded program targeting astrometric SB2 binary systems, ESA's PLATO space mission will provide will enlarge the benchmark sample substantially.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The PAIRS project: a global formation model for planets in binaries.

The number of detected planets orbiting binaries is rapidly increasing thanks to the synergy between transit surveys, Gaia and high-resolution direct imaging campaigns. However, global planet formation models around binary stars are still underdeveloped, which limits the theoretical understanding of planets orbiting binary star systems. Hereby we introduce the PAIRS project, which aims at building a global planet formation model for planets in binaries, and to produce planet populations synthesis to statistically compare theory and observations. In this first paper, we present the adaptation of the circumstellar disc to simulate the formation of S-type planets. The presence of a secondary star tidally truncates and heats the outer part of the circumprimary disc (and vice-versa for the circumsecondary disc), limiting the material to form planets. We implement and quantify this effect for a range of binary parameters by adapting the Bern Model of planet formation in its pebble-based form and for in-situ planet growth. We find that the disc truncation has a strong impact on reducing the pebble supply for core growth, steadily suppressing planet formation for binary separations below 160 au, when considering all the formed planets more massive than Mars. We find as well that S-type planets tend to form close to the central star with respect to the binary separation and disc truncation radius. Our newly developed model will be the basis of future S-type planet population synthesis studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The PAIRS project: a global formation model for planets in binaries. II. Gravitational perturbation effects from secondary stars</a><span class="id">[2601.14215]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Roughly half of Sun-like stars have at least one stellar companion, whereas it is widely assumed that most known exoplanets orbit single stars, largely due to observational biases. However, astrometric surveys, direct imaging, and speckle interferometry are steadily increasing the number of confirmed exoplanets in binaries. A stellar companion introduces additional effects, such as circumstellar disk truncation and gravitational perturbations, which can strongly impact planet formation. While global planet formation models, for example the Bern model, have been broadly applied to single stars, modeling S-type binaries requires key modifications to capture these effects. This study extends the Bern model by incorporating the gravitational influence of a stellar companion into its N-body integrator, allowing us to quantify how this perturbation affects planetary formation and final system architecture across a range of binary configurations. By comparing binary and single-star systems under identical initial conditions, we can assess the specific impact of binary-induced dynamics. We ran three sets of simulations: (i) a grid of in situ single-embryo cases to quantify gravitational effects; (ii) formation simulations with and without migration to compare outcomes with single-star analogs; and (iii) multi-embryo runs to evaluate impacts on multi-planetary systems. Planets forming beyond half the host star's Hill radius are much more likely to become unbound especially in systems with high binary eccentricity. Even within stable zones, growth is suppressed by both reduced material availability and increased eccentricity from stellar perturbations. Both disk truncation and stellar perturbations must be included to model planet formation in S-type binaries accurately. Neglecting either one will end up misrepresenting planetary growth and survival.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The [Fe XIII] Infrared 10747 Angstrom and 10798 Angstrom Lines in Novae</a><span class="id">[2601.14218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The forbidden lines of [Fe XIII] at 10,747 Angstrom and 10,798 Angsrtom are among the most prominent lines in the near-infrared spectrum of the solar corona. They have been used routinely, both outside and during eclipses, as sensitive probes of the electron density and polarization in the solar corona. Many novae pass through a coronal phase, wherein the highly ionized nova ejecta have physical conditions that are remarkably similar to those of the solar corona. Many of the coronal emission lines that are seen are common to the spectra of both the Sun and novae. Yet, it appears that no robust detection of the [Fe XIII] lines has been made in a nova. Here we report the detection of these two infrared [Fe XIII]lines in the spectrum of the recurrent nova V3890 Sgr, taken 23.43 and 31.35 days after its August 2019 outburst. From their line strengths, we derive values of 10^10 per cubic cm and 10^[8.5-9] per cubic cm for the electron density on the two. The decrease in density between epochs can be explained if the density decreased with a power law n   r**alpha with a alpha inferred to be -3. The average temperature of the coronal gas is estimated to be T = (2.51\pm0.06) x 10^6 K. We find that recurrent novae with giant secondaries, including T CrB whose eruption is imminent, are the most suitable sources for further detections of the [Fe XIII] lines. epochs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Matter Creation Process: Observational Constraints on Gravitationally Induced Dark Energy and the Hubble Tension</a><span class="id">[2601.14222]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The persistent Hubble tension and the lack of a fundamental explanation for dark energy motivate the exploration of alternative mechanisms capable of reproducing late-time cosmic acceleration. In this work, we revisit gravitationally induced particle creation as a phenomenological non-equilibrium process that can effectively mimic a dynamical dark-energy component. Within the thermodynamic framework of open systems, we model the production of an unspecified particle species with constant intrinsic equation-of-state parameter and consider four phenomenological parametrisations of the particle-creation rate. The modified continuity and Friedmann equations lead to an effective negative pressure and a redshift-dependent effective equation of state, which we constrain using Cosmic Chronometers, Pantheon+ supernovae, DESI DR2 BAO, a compressed CMB likelihood, and SH0ES data. Using the full dataset combination, we find that particle-creation models provide fits comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, yielding $H_0 \simeq 69.3\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and present-day effective dark-energy equation-of-state values close to $w^{\rm eff}_{\rm DE}(0)\simeq -1$, with all models predicting an accelerating Universe ($q_0\simeq -0.55$). When the Hubble tension is assessed using early- and late-time dataset splits, particle-creation scenarios reduce its statistical significance to the $\simeq 2.4\sigma$–$3\sigma$ level, compared to the $4.3\sigma$ discrepancy obtained in $\Lambda$CDM. Although deviations from $\Lambda$CDM remain mild and Bayesian model comparison indicates no statistical preference between models, gravitationally induced particle creation emerges as a viable late-time extension of the standard cosmological model and provides a consistent phenomenological framework for exploring departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoupling of large-scale, adiabatic inflationary perturbations from enhanced small-scale modes at one-loop</a><span class="id">[2601.14229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We reconsider back-reaction from large amplitude, short-scale perturbations onto a long wavelength adiabatic mode. In a loop expansion of the long-mode power spectrum, this back-reaction appears first at 1-loop. Due to the separation between the long and short scales, the separate universe method provides a simple and efficient framework for this computation. In this paper, building on our earlier work, we employ a $\delta N$ formula for the long mode, which captures the effect of short scales. We show that back-reaction at 1-loop is due to either (i) non-linearity of the $\delta N$ formula, or (ii) 1-loop corrections to the initial conditions. We argue that contributions of type (ii) cannot themselves be described within the separate universe framework, but their properties can be constrained using soft theorems and a ”multi-point propagator” expansion. When applied to a band of enhanced short-scale perturbations that crossed the horizon during inflation, our result shows that the loop correction decouples from their detailed properties. Furthermore, the back-reaction we obtain is scale-invariant. Its magnitude is model-dependent, but is degenerate with effects from modes that were still sub-horizon at the end of inflation. In this scenario (but not necessarily in all scenarios), we conclude that the effect is not observable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using observations of escaping H/He to constrain the atmospheric composition of sub-Neptunes</a><span class="id">[2601.14254]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The internal composition of sub-Neptunes remains a prominent unresolved question in exoplanetary science. We present a technique to place constraints on envelope mean molecular weight that utilises observations of escaping hydrogen or helium exospheres. This method is based on a simple timescale argument, which states that sub-Neptunes require a sufficiently large hydrogen or helium reservoir to explain on-going escape at their observed rates. This then naturally leads to an upper limit on atmospheric mean molecular weight. We apply this technique to archetypal sub-Neptunes, namely GJ-436 b, TOI-776 b and TOI-776 c, which have all been observed to be losing significant hydrogen content as well as relatively featureless transit spectra when observed with JWST. Combining constraints from atmospheric escape and transit spectroscopy in the case of TOI-776 c allows us to tentatively rule out the high mean molecular weight scenario, pointing towards a low mean molecular weight atmosphere with high-altitude aerosols muting spectral features in the infra-red. Finally, we reframe our analysis to the hycean candidate K2-18 b, which has also been shown to host a tentative escaping hydrogen exosphere. If such a detection is robust, we infer a hydrogen-rich envelope mass fraction of $\log f_\text{env} = -1.67\pm0.78$, which is inconsistent with the hycean scenario at the $\sim 4\sigma$ level. This latter result requires further observational follow-up to confirm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A self-consistent explanation of the MeV line in GRB 221009A unveils a dense circum-stellar medium</a><span class="id">[2601.14257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 221009A has been the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) observed to date, and its afterglow has been characterised with unprecedented detail at TeV energies by LHAASO. Quite puzzlingly, it is also the most energetic GRB known. Among the riddles posed by this mysterious source, however, the sheer energetics are hardly the most intriguing: an unprecedented, narrow, luminous emission line at around 10 MeV has been uncovered by a detailed spectral analysis of \textit{Fermi}/GBM data immediately following the brightest peak in the GRB prompt emission and the peak of the TeV afterglow. As noted in the discovery article, the temporal evolution of the line properties can be explained as being due to high-latitude emission from a geometrically thin, relativistically expanding shell where annihilation of a large number of electron-positron pairs took place. We show that this interpretation yields stringent constraints on the properties of such shell, that point to a process that happens at radii typical of external shocks. We then demonstrate that the shell could have been the blastwave associated with the GRB precursor, with the line arising after pair loading of such blastwave as it was illuminated by the bright and hard radiation of the GRB main event. The scenario, which also explains the abrupt initial rise of the LHAASO afterglow, requires the progenitor of the GRB to have been surrounded by a circum-stellar medium (CSM) extending out to a few $10^{15}\,\mathrm{cm}$, with a density $n_\mathrm{ext}\sim 10^{8}-10^{9}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ reminiscent of those found from studies of Type IIn supernovae. This provides a precious clue to the nature of the progenitor of this peculiar GRB, which could also be present in other bursts that feature a long quiescence followed by a bright emission episode with a hard spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing super-heavy dark matter with ultra-high-energy gamma rays</a><span class="id">[2601.11703]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We refine the constraints on the lifetime of decaying super-heavy dark matter particles (SHDM), with masses ranging from $10^7$ to $10^{15}$ GeV, by analyzing ultra-high-energy (UHE) gamma-ray data.

We demonstrate that a precise consideration of the field of view and the geometric acceptance of different UHE gamma-ray observatories has significant implications for the inferred limits of dark matter lifetime. In addition, we examine the influence of uncertainties linked to the current models of the galactic dark matter distribution, employing diverse halo density profiles while varying both their radial extent and the local dark matter density.

The $U(1)_D$ is spontaneously broken by a scalar field $\Phi$, giving mass to the dark gauge boson $X_D$. The dominant DM annihilation proceeds via a forbidden channel, where the DM pair annihilates into slightly heavier dark gauge bosons and scalars after the dark-sector phase transition. Once the dark-sector phase transition occurs, the induced mass gap activates the forbidden annihilation channel, which in turn determines the DM relic abundance and naturally suppresses late-time annihilation. As a result, the scenario avoids stringent cosmic microwave background and indirect detection constraints that typically exclude thermal light DM. Moreover, the same symmetry-breaking phase transition is strongly first-order, producing a stochastic gravitational wave background that could be probed by upcoming space-based interferometers and pulsar timing arrays. We demonstrate that achieving the observed DM abundance tightly correlates the DM mass with the nucleation temperature of the phase transition. Thus, this setup links the DM relic abundance, dark-sector dynamics, and gravitational wave signals, offering complementary paths for discovery in both terrestrial and cosmological observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting $^7$Be Weak and Radiative Transition Rates in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis: Implications for the Primordial Lithium Problem</a><span class="id">[2601.12438]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The primordial 7Li abundance predicted by standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) exceeds that inferred from old, metal-poor stars by a factor of about 3-4. In standard BBN, most primordial 7Li is produced as 7Be in the early Universe and later converted by electron capture. Additional production or destruction channels of 7Be, such as proton capture or antineutrino capture during BBN, may therefore affect the final lithium yield. We quantify the depletion of 7Be due to in-situ electron capture, including the associated antineutrino channel, positron decay from nuclear excited states, and proton capture through the radiative 7Be(p,gamma)8B reaction. We also investigate stimulated emission induced by the dense photon background during the nuclear statistical equilibrium epoch, as well as a three-body Auger-like variant transferring the capture energy to a continuum electron. Decay rates are computed using first-order perturbation theory, modelling weak interactions with a Fermi contact term and factorising hadronic and leptonic currents. Thermally averaged rates are obtained by folding cross-sections with Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions and accounting for particle densities in the temperature range 10-100 keV. We find that the electron-capture rate decreases rapidly with temperature and is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the antineutrino channel. Stimulated emission and plasma screening increase the radiative proton-capture rate by only 1-3 percent at temperatures around 87 keV. The Auger-like channel contributes at the level of a few thousandths of a percent and becomes negligible at lower temperatures. Overall, our total rate revises previous estimates by nearly an order of magnitude. Electron capture, proton capture, and positron decay provide corrections to the dominant depletion channel 7Be(n,p)7Li.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plasmoid formation via competing lower-hybrid drift and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities: A hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic simulation study</a><span class="id">[2601.12466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the nonlinear formation of plasmoids in 2D low-beta current sheets through the interplay between the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Using a hybrid kinetic-gyrokinetic model-based Super Simple Vlasov (ssV) code with fully kinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons, we simulate Harris-type current sheets and velocity shear layers with strong cross-field density gradients. Our central hypothesis is that steep density gradients drive LHDI, which can grow faster than KHI and initiate an inverse cascade from kinetic to fluid scales, potentially suppressing KHI. Our simulations confirm that, in thin current sheets, LHDI develops rapidly at the sheet edges and nonlinearly merges into larger-scale magnetic islands before KHI can evolve. These LHDI-driven structures distort the velocity shear and suppress classical KH vortices. In contrast, for thicker current sheets or weaker density gradients, KHI dominates and produces the expected rolled-up vortices and associated plasmoids. These findings demonstrate that LHDI-induced turbulence can act as both a seed and a regulator of plasmoid-generating instabilities, mediating cross-scale energy transfer. This mechanism is relevant to thin boundary layers in space plasmas, such as the solar wind magnetosphere interface, and suggests that microturbulence can govern large-scale magnetic topology during collisionless reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Baryon-dark matter coincidence in Randall-Sundrum Model</a><span class="id">[2601.13315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Within the framework of the extra-dimensional Randall-Sundrum set-up, we investigate the freeze-in production of Standard Model (SM) gauge-singlet scalar, fermionic, and massive vector dark matter (DM).

Increases in entropy due to binary black hole mergers, as implied in the second law of thermodynamics, should also be added to the budget. In this study, we update the cosmological entropy budget for black holes in the stellar to lite-intermediate-mass range $(5-300~M_\odot)$, originating from either supernovae or binary mergers, by utilizing a suite of population synthesis models and phenomenological fits derived from numerical relativity. We report three new insights: Firstly, the cumulative entropy from merging black holes surpasses the total entropy from cosmic microwave background photons around the onset of the Over-massive Black Hole Galaxy phase at $z\sim 12$, suggesting that mergers played a more significant role in shaping the thermodynamic state of the early universe than relic radiation. Secondly, if primordial black holes constitute a nonzero fraction of dark matter, their early binary mergers establish an “entropy floor&quot; in the Dark Ages and can dominate the cumulative merger-generated entropy history even for small abundances. Thirdly, by computing the cosmological density parameters, we highlight the thermodynamic asymmetry in black hole mergers, where the production of gravitational-wave energy is inefficient compared to the immense generation of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasi-linear approach of bi-Kappa distributed electrons with dynamic $κ$ parameter.

However, the temporal variation of the parameter $\kappa$, which quantifies the presence of suprathermal particles, is not fully captured by such a QL analysis, and typically $\kappa$ remains constant during plasma dynamics. We propose a new QL modeling that goes beyond the limits of a previous approach, realistically assuming that the quasithermal core cannot evolve independently of energetic suprathermals. The case study is done on the electron-cyclotron (EMEC) instability generated by anisotropic bi-Kappa electrons with $A=T_\perp/T_\parallel &gt; 1$ ($\parallel, \perp$ denoting directions with respect to the background magnetic field). The parameter $\kappa$ self-consistently varies through the QL equation of kurtosis (fourth-order moment) coupled with temporal variations of the temperature components, relaxing the constraint on the independence of the low-energy (core) electrons and suprathermal high-energy tails of VDs. The results refine and extend previous approaches. A clear distinction is made between regimes that lead to a decrease or an increase in the $\kappa$ parameter with saturation of the instability. What predominates is a decrease in $\kappa$, i.e., an excess of suprathermalization, which energizes suprathermal electrons due to self-generated wave fluctuations. Additionally, we found that VDs can evolve toward a quasi-Maxwellian shape (as $\kappa$ increases) primarily in regimes with low beta and initial kappa values greater than five.

The resulting low-density nucleonic EoSs are subsequently matched to a model-agnostic speed-of-sound parametrization, constrained by astrophysical observations, including NICER mass-radius measurements, tidal deformability limits from GW170817, and lower bounds on the maximum neutron-star mass inferred from radio pulsar observations. We find that the admissible range of the transition density is strongly sensitive to the choice of the low-density EoS. In particular, the inclusion of explicit FN constraints significantly reduces the allowed parameter space of the nucleonic EoS at low densities, narrowing the transition-density range by nearly a factor of two. Consequently, neutron-star properties inferred from EoSs with explicit FN constraints differ substantially, with especially pronounced effects for low-mass neutron stars and their correlations with nuclear matter parameters. A quantitative comparison, using metrics based on Mahalanobis distance, shows consistency of the explicit constraints with PSRs J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and J0437-4715, but suggest a possible tension with PSR J0614-3329. These findings underscore the critical importance of a consistent treatment of finite-nuclei properties for reliably inferring the behavior of high-density matter and the presence of possible phase transitions from astrophysical observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cosmic Expansion History from Line-Intensity Mapping</a><span class="id">[1907.10065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Line-intensity mapping (LIM) of emission from star-forming galaxies can be used to measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale as far back as the epoch of reionization. This provides a standard cosmic ruler to constrain the expansion rate of the Universe at redshifts which cannot be directly probed otherwise. In light of growing tension between measurements of the current expansion rate using the local distance ladder and those inferred from the cosmic microwave background, extending the constraints on the expansion history to bridge between the late and early Universe is of paramount importance. Using a newly derived methodology to robustly extract cosmological information from LIM, which minimizes the inherent degeneracy with unknown astrophysics, we show that present and future experiments can gradually improve the measurement precision of the expansion rate history, ultimately reaching percent-level constraints on the BAO scale. Specifically, we provide detailed forecasts for the SPHEREx satellite, which will target the H$\alpha$ and Lyman-$\alpha$ lines, and for the ground-based COMAP instrument – as well as a future stage-3 experiment – that will target the CO rotational lines. Besides weighing in on the so-called Hubble tension, reliable LIM cosmic rulers can enable wide-ranging tests of dark matter, dark energy and modified gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">110.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.10067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A User's Guide to Extracting Cosmological Information from Line-Intensity Maps</a><span class="id">[1907.10067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Line-intensity mapping (LIM) provides a promising way to probe cosmology, reionization and galaxy evolution.

Here we develop a comprehensive framework for modelling the LIM power spectrum, which includes redshift space distortions and the Alcock-Paczynski effect. We then identify and isolate degeneracies with astrophysics so that they can be marginalized over. We study the gains of using the multipole expansion of the anisotropic power spectrum, providing an accurate analytic expression for their covariance, and find a 10%-60% increase in the precision of the baryon acoustic oscillation scale measurements when including the hexadecapole in the analysis. We discuss different observational strategies when targeting other cosmological parameters, such as the sum of neutrino masses or primordial non-Gaussianity, finding that fewer and wider bins are typically more optimal.

In the penumbral zones of the planet, spherical symmetry of the star reduces to an axial symmetry. Our work aims to put forward a fundamental explanation, using energy conservation, to determine the variation of irradiance in the penumbral zone on a close-in planet where the point-sized source approximation fails. Consequently, we propose a numerical model that accurately predicts the irradiance within the boundaries of the penumbral zone and the fully-illuminated zone. Our analysis also corrects a previous study on exoplanet irradiation that violates energy conservation. We find that night-side illumination partially explains the observed night-side temperatures on the planets considered; this reduces reliance on heat transport models to explain the night-side temperature for the few exemplar rocky close-in planets, namely K2-141 b, 55 Cancri e, TOI-561 b, TOI-431 b, and Kepler-10 b, that are discussed in this work. We provide improved day-night contrast temperatures, considering an airless scenario, and highlight the need for revisiting the heat transport models associated with atmospheric modelling of planets where the night-side illumination is significant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">113.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The compact object of HESS J1731-347 and its implication on neutron star matter</a><span class="id">[2408.15220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate the impact of the possibility of a small, subsolar mass compact star, such as the recently reported central compact object of HESS J1731-347, on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars.

The unknown properties of dark energy, the driver of this acceleration, have not only prompted extensive studies on its nature but also spurred interest in modified gravity theories that might serve as alternatives. In this paper, we adopt a bumblebee vector-tensor modified gravity theory to model the cosmic expansion history and derive predictions for the Hubble parameter. We constrain the bumblebee model parameters using observational data from established probes, including the Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae calibrated via the SH0ES (Supernova $H_0$ for the Equation of State) Cepheid distance ladder analysis and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2), as well as recently included cosmic chronometers (CC) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling of the Bayesian posterior distribution enables us to rigorously constrain the bumblebee models and compare them with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the bumblebee theory on its own can provide sufficiently good fits to the current observational data of distance- and time-redshift relations, suggesting its potential to explain the cosmic background dynamics. However, when compared to $\Lambda$CDM, the latter still outperforms the former according to the information criteria. We propose that further constraints from cosmological perturbation tests could impose more stringent constraints on bumblebee cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">116.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2412.09381]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties.

This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems.

In this work, we present the first full-sky computation of the angular bispectrum in second-order perturbation theory without invoking the Limber approximation, and formulated for finite redshift bins via window functions. To our knowledge, even the Newtonian part within this setup is novel. Building on this, we also include, up to second order in perturbation theory, the dynamical general relativistic and radiation effects, together with the leading relativistic projection effects. For simplicity, we neglect tracer bias and line-of-sight integrated contributions, however note that in particular the former can be straightforwardly incorporated within our framework. We evaluate the bispectrum contributions for two redshift bins, $1.75 \leq z \leq 2.25$ and $0.55 \leq z \leq 0.65$, and compare our theoretical prediction against relativistic light-cone simulations, with line-of-sight integral effects removed so as to enable direct consistency checks. As expected, we find that the Newtonian contributions are typically one or more orders of magnitudes larger than the relativistic signal across the entire spectrum for both redshifts. At $z=2$, we find that projection and dynamical relativistic effects have comparable amplitudes on large scales; somewhat unexpectedly, however, radiation effects dominate the relativistic signal in the squeezed limit. At $z=0.6$, the expected hierarchy is recovered, though dynamical corrections remain non-negligible – only a factor of 2-3 smaller than projection effects. Our theoretical results agree fairly well with simulation measurements for the total bispectrum. To facilitate future applications and reproducibility, we make the corresponding code publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">118.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinguishing Orbiting and Infalling Dark Matter Particles with Machine Learning</a><span class="id">[2506.09146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter halos are typically defined as spheres that enclose some overdensity, but these sharp, somewhat arbitrary boundaries introduce non-physical artifacts such as backsplash halos, pseudo-evolution, and an incomplete accounting of halo mass. A more physically motivated alternative is to define halos as the collection of particles that are physically orbiting within their potential well. However, existing methods to classify particles as orbiting or infalling suffer from trade-offs between accuracy, computational cost, and generalizability across cosmologies. We present an efficient, yet accurate, supervised machine learning approach using decision trees. The classification is based on only the particle radii and velocities at two epochs. Compared to detailed analysis of particle trajectories, we find that our model matches the classification of 97\% of particles. Consequently, we are able to quickly and accurately reproduce the density profiles of the orbiting and infalling components out to many virial radii. We demonstrate that our model generalizes to a significantly different cosmology that lies outside the training dataset. We make publicly available both our final model and the code to train similar models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">119.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</a><span class="id">[2506.14041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained “asteroid-mass” window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: An emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum</a><span class="id">[2506.18974]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the impact of baryonic processes such as star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on matter clustering is crucial to ensure precise and unbiased cosmological inference. Most theoretical models of baryonic effects to date focus on two-point statistics, neglecting higher-order contributions. This work develops a fast and accurate emulator for baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum, a key non-Gaussian statistic in the nonlinear regime. We employ high-resolution $N$-body simulations from the BACCO suite and apply a combination of cutting-edge techniques such as cosmology scaling and baryonification to efficiently span a large cosmological and astrophysical parameter space. A deep neural network is trained to emulate baryonic effects on the matter bispectrum measured in simulations, capturing modifications across various scales and redshifts relevant to Euclid. We validate the emulator accuracy and robustness using an analysis of \Euclid mock data, employing predictions from the state-of-the-art FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations. The emulator reproduces baryonic suppression in the bispectrum to better than 2$\%$ for the $68\%$ percentile across most triangle configurations for $k \in [0.01, 20]\,\mathrm{i}h\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ and ensures consistency between cosmological posteriors inferred from second- and third-order weak lensing statistics. These results demonstrate that our emulator meets the high-precision requirements of the Euclid mission for at least the first data release and provides reliable forecasts of the cosmological information contained in the small-scale matter bispectrum. This underscores the potential of emulation techniques to bridge the gap between complex baryonic physics and observational data, maximising the scientific output of Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">121.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Accretion Flare Interpretation for the Ultra-High-Energy Neutrino Event KM3-230213A</a><span class="id">[2506.21111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the origin of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrino event KM3-230213A detected by KM3NeT, focusing on MRC 0614-083 which has been pinpointed as the closest blazar to the neutrino localization exhibiting variable multi-wavelength emission.

Large sets of numerical results are processed and connected in a consistent manner, using two key quantities: the mass of the star's Carbon-Oxygen (CO) core at an advanced pre-collapse stage - which depends on binary evolution effects - and the compactness parameter, which is the main descriptor of the post-collapse neutrino emission. The method enables us to model the neutrino emission of a very diverse, binary-affected population of stars, which cannot unambiguously be mapped in detail by existing core collapse simulations. We find that including black hole-forming collapses enhances the DSNB by up to 50% at energies greater than 30-40 MeV. Binary evolution effects can change the total rate of collapses and generate a sub-population of high core mass stars that are stronger neutrino emitters. However, the net effect on the DSNB is moderate - up to a 15% increase in flux - due to the rarity of these super-massive cores and to the relatively modest dependence of the neutrino emission on the CO core mass. The methodology presented here is suitable for extensions and generalizations, and therefore it lays the foundation for modern treatments of the DSNB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">124.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational lensing rarely produces high-mass outliers to the compact binary population</a><span class="id">[2507.07964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>All gravitational-wave signals are inevitably gravitationally lensed by intervening matter as they propagate through the Universe. When a gravitational-wave signal is magnified, it \emph{appears} to have originated from a closer, more massive system. Thus, high-mass outliers to the gravitational-wave source population are often proposed as natural candidates for strongly lensed events. However, when using a data-driven method for identifying population outliers, we find that high-mass outliers are not necessarily strongly lensed, nor will the majority of strongly-lensed signals appear as high-mass outliers. This is both because statistical fluctuations produce a larger effect on observed binary parameters than does lensing magnification, and because lensing-induced outliers must originate from intrinsically high-mass sources, which are rare. Thus, the appearance of a single lensing-induced outlier implies the existence of many other lensed events within the catalog. We additionally show that it is possible to constrain the strong lensing optical depth, which is a fundamental quantity of our Universe, with the detection or absence of high-mass outliers. However, constraints using the latest gravitational-wave catalog are weak$\unicode{x2014}$we obtain an upper limit on the optical depth of sources at redshift $1$ magnified by a factor of $5$ or more of $\tau(\mu\geq5,z=1)\leq 0.035 \unicode{x2014}$and future observing runs will not make an outlier-based method competitive with other probes of the optical depth. However, the full inferred population of compact binaries may be more informative of the distribution of lenses in the Universe, opening a unique opportunity to access the high-redshift Universe and constrain cosmic structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">125.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optical and near-infrared nebular-phase spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi: constraints on the structure of the inner ejecta, progenitor mass, and dust</a><span class="id">[2508.02656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of the nearby Type II supernova SN 2024ggi from 250 and 581 days after the explosion.

In this picture, a mechanical failure of the crust excites seismic motions of the magnetar surface that launch force-free waves into the magnetosphere. We first investigate this problem analytically and then perform three-dimensional numerical simulations. Our simulations follow the propagation of high-frequency magneto-elastic waves in the entire crust, and include magnetic coupling to the dipolar magnetosphere and liquid core through simplified radiation boundary conditions. We observe seismic waves bouncing between the crust-core interface and the surface with a characteristic frequency $\sim 1$ kHz, which could appear as a modulation of the magnetospheric radiation. Both the star quake and its associated magnetospheric wave emission are strongly damped on a timescale $\sim 10 \ \rm ms$ by magnetic coupling to the liquid core. Since the seismic waves are significantly damped before they can spread laterally around the crust, magnetospheric wave emission occurs primarily near the initial epicenter of the quake. Our simulations suggest that non-axisymmetric quakes will launch a mixture of Alfvén and fast magnetosonic waves into the magnetosphere.

We present the results of a broadband, multi-wavelength study of MAXI J1744-294, including data from the NuSTAR, Chandra, XMM-Newton, Swift, and NICER X-ray telescopes, as well as complementary radio and near-infrared observations. We analyze the changing X-ray emission as the outburst evolved from the high/soft to the low/hard state. Using relativistic reflection features in the data, we estimate a spin of $a&gt;0.92$ and viewing inclination $\theta=28^{+3}_{-4}$ deg. Based on the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source, we identify MAXI J1744-294 as a candidate black hole (BH) low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) – the fourth candidate BH transient discovered within a (projected) distance of one pc from the Galactic supermassive black hole Sgr A*. This discovery provides further evidence for a cusp of BH-LMXBs in the central pc of our Galaxy, as argued for in previous observational studies and suggested by analytical and theoretical work. Our ongoing multi-wavelength study, involving a complementary range of observatories and spanning different outburst states, can serve as a model for future time domain astrophysics research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">129.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A HyperFlash and ÉCLAT view of the local environment and energetics of the repeating FRB 20240619D</a><span class="id">[2509.16374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time-variable propagation effects provide a window into the local plasma environments of repeating fast radio burst (FRB) sources. Here we report high-cadence observations of FRB 20240619D, as part of the HyperFlash and ÉCLAT programs. We observed for $500$h and detected $217$ bursts, including $10$ bursts with high fluence ($&gt;25$ Jy ms) and implied energy. We track burst-to-burst variations in dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM), from which we constrain the parallel magnetic field strength in the source's local environment: $0.27\pm0.13$ mG. Apparent DM variations between sub-bursts in a single bright event are interpreted as coming from plasma lensing or variable emission height. We also identify two distinct scintillation screens along the line of sight, one associated with the Milky Way and the other likely located in the FRB's host galaxy or local environment. Together, these (time-variable) propagation effects reveal that FRB 20240619D is embedded in a dense, turbulent and highly magnetised plasma. The source's environment is more dynamic than that measured for many other (repeating) FRB sources, but less extreme compared to several repeaters that are associated with a compact, persistent radio source. FRB 20240619D's cumulative burst fluence distribution shows a power-law break, with a flat tail at high energies. Along with previous studies, this emphasises a common feature in the burst energy distribution of hyperactive repeaters. Using the break in the burst fluence distribution, we estimate a source redshift of $z=0.042$-$0.240$. We discuss FRB 20240619D's nature in the context of similar studies of other repeating FRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">130.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light curves of time-dependent accretion disk in tidal disruption events</a><span class="id">[2509.16544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are believed to be an ideal laboratory for studying the evolution of accretion flow around a supermassive black hole (BH). In general, the mass feeding rate to the BH is suggested to be super-Eddington initially, and evolves to be sub-Eddington on timescales of years. In this paper, we carry out calculations of the time-dependent evolution of accretion disk in the standard environment of TDE, i.e., injecting matter at the circularization radius of the stellar debris in the form of $\dot M_{\rm inject} \propto t^{-5/3}$. One of the main findings is that when $\dot M_{\rm inject}$ evolves to a value around the Eddington accretion rate, the radiation pressure instability occurs. We test the influence of the model parameters on the light curves, such as the BH mass $M_{\rm BH}$, viscosity parameter $\alpha$, and mass-injecting radius $R_{\rm{out}}$, all of which are found to affect the light curves to some extent. In most cases, we find that the light curves oscillate significantly due to the radiation pressure instability. As an exception, when $\alpha$ is small or $R_{\rm{out}}$ is large, we find that the oscillations are completely suppressed. In this case, the light curve drops steeply and then becomes flat in the late-time evolution, which we apply to explain the observed ultraviolet (UV) light curves of ASASSN-15oi and ASASSN-14ae together with the assumption of a photosphere. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of our time-dependent accretion disk model to explaining multi-band light curves of TDEs in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">131.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BAO miscalibration cannot rescue late-time solutions to the Hubble tension</a><span class="id">[2510.01974]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements play a key role in ruling out post-recombination solutions to the Hubble tension. However, because the data compression leading to these measurements assumes a fiducial $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, their reliability in testing late-time modifications to $\Lambda$CDM has at times been called into question. We play devil's advocate and posit that fiducial cosmology assumptions do indeed affect BAO measurements in such a way that low-redshift acoustic angular scales (proportional to the Hubble constant $H_0$) are biased low, and test whether such a rescaling can rescue post-recombination solutions. The answer is no. Firstly, strong constraints on the shape of the $z \lesssim 2$ expansion history from unanchored Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) prevent large deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. In addition, unless $\Omega_m$ is significantly lower than $0.3$, the rescaled BAO measurements would be in strong tension with geometrical information from the Cosmic Microwave Background. We demonstrate this explicitly on several dark energy (DE) models ($w$CDM, CPL DE, phenomenologically emergent DE, holographic DE, $\Lambda_s$CDM, and the negative cosmological constant model), finding that none can address the Hubble tension once unanchored SNeIa are included. We argue that the $\Lambda_s$CDM sign-switching cosmological constant model possesses interesting features which make it the least unpromising one among those tested. Our results demonstrate that possible fiducial cosmology-induced BAO biases cannot be invoked as loopholes to the Hubble tension &quot;no-go theorem&quot;, and highlight the extremely important but so far underappreciated role of unanchored SNeIa in ruling out post-recombination solutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">132.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vision-Based CNN Prediction of Sunspot Numbers from SDO/HMI Images</a><span class="id">[2510.03473]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sunspot numbers provide the longest continuous record of solar activity and remain a key index for heliophysical research and space-weather applications. Standard sunspot determination relies on visual inspection and algorithmic feature-detection pipelines, both of which involve methodological choices and can be sensitive to image quality and implementation details. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an alternative by learning an end-to-end mapping from solar images to a scalar index, reducing reliance on explicit, handcrafted feature design. Here we present a supervised vision-based regression framework to estimate the daily sunspot number from full-disk continuum images acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We pair daily images from 2011-2024 with the SILSO Version 2.0 daily sunspot number and train a CNN to infer the scalar value at the observation time of each image. On an independent test split, the model achieves R2=0.964, RMSE=9.75, and MAE=6.74, indicating close agreement with SILSO across a wide activity range. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients show that the network attributions concentrate on sunspot-bearing regions, supporting the physical plausibility of the learned representations. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct image-to-index estimation for scalable solar monitoring. Future work will explore multimodal fusion with complementary observables (e.g., magnetograms) and standardized cross-cycle benchmarks to assess robustness under changing solar conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">133.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</a><span class="id">[2510.06939]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photoevaporative mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observation we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">134.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavendish experiment with fast radio bursts on cosmological scales</a><span class="id">[2510.11022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A key measure of gravity is the relation between the Weyl potential $\Psi+\Phi$ and the matter overdensity $\delta_m$, encapsulated as an effective gravitational constant $G_{\rm light}$ for light motion. Its value, along with possible spatial and temporal variations, is essential for probing physics beyond Einstein gravity. However, the absence of an unbiased proxy for $\delta_m$ prevents the direct measurement of $G_{\rm light}$. In this letter, we point out that the equivalence principle guarantees the dispersion measure (DM) of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs) as a good proxy for $\delta_m$. We further propose an FRB-based estimator $F_G$ to directly measure $G_{\rm light}$, combining galaxy-DM of localized FRBs and galaxy-weak lensing cross-correlations. With a conservative cut $k\leq 0.1h$/Mpc, the measurement can achieve a precision of $\lesssim 10\% \sqrt{10^5/N_{\rm FRB}}$ over 10 equal-width redshift bins at $z\lesssim 1$. The major systematic error, arising from the clustering bias of electrons traced by the FRB DM, remains subdominant at the $5\%$ level. It can be further mitigated to the $\lesssim 1\%$ level, based on the gastrophysics-agnostic behavior that the clustering bias of total baryons (ionized diffuse gas, stars, neutral hydrogen, etc) approaches unity at sufficiently large scales. Therefore, FRBs shed light on gravitational physics across spatial and temporal scales spanning 20 orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">135.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</a><span class="id">[2510.18706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state.

In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">136.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization Diagnostics Applied to Coronal Mass Ejections and the Background Solar Wind</a><span class="id">[2511.00714]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ratio of radially to tangentially polarized Thomson-scattered white light provides a powerful tool for locating the 3D position of compact structures in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) has been designed to take full advantage of this diagnostic capability. Interestingly, this same observable that establishes the position of transient blob-like structures becomes a local measure of the slope of the global falloff of density in the background solar wind. It is thus important to characterize the extent along the line of sight of structures being studied, in order to determine whether they are sufficiently compact for 3D positioning. In this paper, we build from analyses of individual lines of sight to three-dimensional models of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), allowing us to consider how accurately polarization properties of the transient and quiescent solar wind are diagnosed.

When isolated, this phase shift allows one to robustly infer the presence of the cosmic neutrino background in BAO and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data independently of other cosmological parameters. While in the context of the Standard Model, this phase shift follows a known scale-dependent relation, new physics in the cosmic neutrino background could alter the overall shape of this feature. In this paper, we discuss how changes in the neutrino phase shift could be used to constrain self-interactions among neutrinos. We produce simple models for this phase-shift assuming universal self-interactions, and use these in order to understand what constraining power is available for the strength of such interactions in BAO and CMB data. We find that, although challenging, it may be possible to use a detection of the phase to put a more robust limit on the strength of the self-interaction, $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which at present suffers from bimodality in cosmological constraints. Our forecast analysis reveals that BAO data alone will not provide the precision needed to tightly constrain self-interactions; however, the combined analysis of the phase shift signature in both CMB and BAO can potentially provide a way to detect the impact of new neutrino interactions. Our results could be extended upon for models with non-universal interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">138.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates</a><span class="id">[2511.01859]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the &quot;PUSH method&quot;, focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few &quot;key reactions&quot; that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">139.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission as the Driving Mechanism in Long-Period Radio Transients</a><span class="id">[2511.15154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period radio transients (LPRTs) are highly polarised, coherent radio sources with periods of minutes to hours and bursts typically lasting 10 to 100 s. Here we consider the apparently isolated subclass of LPRTs and argue that electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) explains their narrow duty cycles and polarisation properties. In particular, we show that intrinsically circular ECME can emerge as predominantly linear after undergoing Faraday conversion in an overlying magnetospheric plasma layer, thus reconciling the observed high linear fractions with a circularly polarised maser. In this picture, a rotating oblique magnetosphere beams radiation into a thin, hollow emission cone whose surface lies almost perpendicular to the local magnetic field. The observed very narrow pulses arise when the line of sight skims the cone, while broader profiles and weak leading or trailing components occur when multiple azimuths along the emission ring meet the maser resonance condition. The observed isotropic-equivalent luminosities of about 10^30 to 10^31 erg s^-1 correspond to modest intrinsic powers once strong ECME beaming is taken into account. We show that such power levels can be supplied by accretion from the interstellar medium (ISM), and that detectability at kiloparsec distances favours slowly rotating neutron stars with comparatively low surface magnetic fields below about 10^10 Gauss and low space velocities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">140.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Absorption effects in the expanding Universe: spectral transmittance functions of intergalactic medium for distant sources</a><span class="id">[2511.16291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse the formation of broad absorption troughs in the spectra of high-redshift sources in the redshift range $5\le z\le15$ for two observationally motivated reionization histories inferred from distant galaxy spectra and CMB polarization measurements.

We then introduce lattice implementations of non-canonical interactions, considering scalars with a non-minimal coupling to gravity, $\phi^2R$, non-minimal scalar kinetic theories, $\mathcal{G}_{ab}(\lbrace\phi_c\rbrace)\partial_\mu\phi^a\partial^\mu\phi^b$, and axion-like particle (ALP) interactions with Abelian gauge fields, $\phi F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}$.

Unrelated to non-canonical aspects, we also discuss implementation(s) of gravitational wave (GW) dynamics on the lattice.

Accurate DM estimation is therefore essential for characterizing FRB sources and testing physical models, yet current dedispersion methods can be computationally intensive and prone to human bias. In this proof-of-concept study, we develop and benchmark three deep-learning architectures, a conventional convolutional neural network (CNN), a fine-tuned ResNet-50, and a hybrid CNN-LSTM model, for automated DM estimation. All models are trained and validated on a large set of synthetic FRB dynamic spectra generated using CHIME/FRB-like specifications. The hybrid CNN-LSTM achieves the highest accuracy and stability while maintaining low computational cost across the investigated DM range. Although trained on simulated data, these models can be fine-tuned on real CHIME/FRB observations and extended to future facilities, offering a scalable pathway toward real-time, data-driven DM estimation in large FRB surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">144.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A spectroscopically confirmed, strongly lensed, metal-poor Type II supernova at z = 5.13</a><span class="id">[2601.04156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observing supernovae (SNe) in the early Universe (z &gt; 3) provides a window into how both galaxies and individual stars have evolved over cosmic time, yet a detailed study of high-redshift stars and SNe has remained difficult due to their extreme distances and cosmological redshifting.

Here we present the discovery of &quot;SN Eos&quot;: a strongly lensed, multiply-imaged, SN II at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 5.133 +/- 0.001. SN Eos exploded in a Lyman-{\alpha} emitting galaxy when the Universe was only  1 billion years old, shortly after it reionized and became transparent to ultraviolet radiation. A year prior to our discovery in JWST data, archival HST imaging of SN Eos reveals rest-frame far ultraviolet ( 1,300Å) emission, indicative of shock breakout or interaction with circumstellar material in the first few (rest-frame) days after explosion. The JWST spectroscopy of SN Eos, now the farthest spectroscopically confirmed SN ever discovered, shows that SN Eos's progenitor star likely formed in a metal-poor environment (&lt;= 0.1 Z_{\odot}), providing the first direct evidence of massive star formation in the metal-poor, early Universe.

The system was identified via periodic variability in Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System light curves of Gaia white dwarf candidates. Follow-up spectroscopy with the Large Lenslet Array Magellan Spectrograph reveals a helium dominated accretion disk, while high speed ULTRACAM photometry shows pronounced primary and secondary eclipses. We construct a decade long orbital timing baseline using ATLAS and Gaia survey photometry together with high speed observations from ULTRACAM on the NTT and proto Lightspeed on the Magellan Clay telescope. From this baseline we measure an orbital period derivative Pdot = -1.60 +/- 0.07 x 10^-12 seconds per second. Interpreted in the context of stable mass transfer, the magnitude and sign of Pdot indicate orbital evolution governed by the interplay between gravitational wave driven angular momentum losses and mass transfer, directly probing the donor star structural response to mass loss. Assuming angular momentum loss dominated by gravitational radiation, we constrain the component masses and infer the characteristic gravitational wave strain. We predict a four year Laser Interferometer Space Antenna signal to noise ratio greater than 10, establishing ATLAS J1013-4516 as a strong prospective space based gravitational wave source that probes long term orbital evolution in the mass transferring regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">148.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of disc photoevaporation on the long-term evolution of giant planets in mean motion resonances</a><span class="id">[2601.10811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the long-term impact of disc photoevaporation on the dynamical stability and evolution of giant planet pairs in mean motion resonances. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with FARGO3D, in which we have included mass-loss due to photoevaporation, we explore a parameter space covering disc mass, viscosity, planet mass, and resonance type. We find that strong photoevaporation depletes gas in the common gap between the planets, slowing migration and suppressing planet-disc interactions that typically lead to resonance breaking and eccentricity damping. This stabilising effect is most significant for 3:2 resonances, which are more prone to disruption due to the reduced planet spacing. In contrast, 2:1 resonances are generally more robust but can still be destabilised at high disc mass and moderate-to-strong photoevaporation due to asymmetric torques. Photoevaporation can therefore stabilise resonances that would otherwise break, or conversely disrupt resonances that are natively more stable. Even in cases where photoevaporation does not directly affect resonance stability, it typically results in increased planetary eccentricities. These results highlight the complex, system-dependent nature of resonance evolution, with implications for the final orbital architectures of giant planet systems and their detectability via astrometry from missions such as Gaia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">149.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiative Cooling Effects on Plasmoid Formation in Black Hole Accretion Flows with Multiple Magnetic Loops</a><span class="id">[2601.10968]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the influence of radiative cooling on plasmoid formation in black hole accretion flows using 2D and 3D two-temperature GRMHD simulations with multi-loop magnetic fields.

A key conceptual question is whether such a background evolution is compatible with the stability of local, gravitationally bound systems, in particular black holes. This work examines black hole thermodynamics within the GCT framework, focusing on the geometric compatibility between a locally static region and a time-dependent cosmological background. By matching a static interior spacetime to a GCT-FLRW exterior across a timelike boundary, it is shown that the Israel junction conditions allow for the coexistence of distinct time normalizations without introducing surface stresses. In this setting, the local interior naturally admits a unit lapse function, while the background evolution is encoded in the cosmological time gauge. The resulting separation of time normalizations implies that the effective GCT parameter governing local physics is observationally indistinguishable from b_{\mathrm{local}} \simeq 0. Under this geometric shielding, black hole thermodynamics reduces to its standard general relativistic form, and the Generalized Second Law is satisfied without imposing additional constraints on the background parameter b. These results indicate that the empirical stability of black hole thermodynamics does not directly constrain the global GCT evolution but instead reflects a geometric decoupling between local and cosmological time gauges. Black hole stability thus emerges as a consistency condition for geometric shielding, rather than as independent evidence for or against the underlying cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">152.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strongly Interacting Dark Matter admixed Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2503.19691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter may accumulate in neutron stars given its gravitational interaction and abundance.

We consider generalized version of the framework as $f(\bar{R})$, $\bar{R}$ being the scalar of the modified curvature tensor. $f(\bar{R})$ gravity is recast in Einstein frame as non-minimally coupled scalar tensor theory where the scalar field gets coupled with a rank 2 antisymmetric torsion field through derivative couplings. We investigate whether the introduction of three additional torsion-dependent terms in Einstein frame help to realize a bounce. We first explore this cosmological system in the background of a homogeneous and isotropic FRW spacetime but inclusion of the torsion terms are insufficient to produce a bounce in this symmetric setting. Motivated by this limitation, we relax the symmetry and generalize the background to include inhomogeneity and anisotropy. In this setup, the dynamics is modified in such a way that a bouncing solution is possible without invoking phantom fields or energy condition violations. We have found the exact solutions of all the fields and reconstructed the modified gravity form. We have addressed the behaviour of the fields under perturbation and investigated the stability of the solutions.

The nucleon-nucleon interaction is modeled using the AV18 potential supplemented by Urbana three-body forces, while $\Lambda N$ and $\Lambda \Lambda$ interactions are described by realistic spin- and parity-dependent potentials fitted to hypernuclear data. Cold, charge-neutral, and $\beta$-equilibrated matter composed of neutrons, protons, electrons, muons, and $\Lambda$ hyperons is considered. We compute particle fractions, chemical potentials, the EOS, speed of sound, tidal deformability, and stellar structure by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and compare our results with recent NICER and gravitational-wave observations. The inclusion of $\Lambda$ hyperons leads to EOS softening, reducing the maximum NS mass from $2.34M_\odot$ to $2.07M_\odot$, while keeping it consistent with the $2M_\odot$ mass constraint. At $1.4M_\odot$, the model satisfies observational limits on radius and tidal deformability, with the $\Lambda$ onset occurring below this mass. Comparison with other microscopic and relativistic mean-field models shows that our EOS remains consistent with the allowed pressure-energy density range, while also permitting even canonical-mass NSs of about $1.4M_{\odot}$ to accommodate hyperons. These results suggest that hyperons can appear in NSs across the observed mass range without violating current astrophysical constraints, and that the extended LOCV method provides a consistent, microscopic approach to modeling dense hypernuclear matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">157.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16289" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charged particle dynamics in singular spacetimes: hydrogenic mapping and curvature-corrected thermodynamics</a><span class="id">[2509.16289]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the dynamics of charged test particles in a singular, horizonless spacetime arising as the massless limit of a charged wormhole in the Einstein–Maxwell–Scalar (EMS) framework.

This is primarily because spacecraft measurements have been limited to magnetic field fluctuations alone. We resolve this by deriving new high-resolution density fluctuations from spacecraft potential measurements of Parker Solar Probe resolving scales smaller than the electron gyro-radius ($\rho_e$). A systematic comparison of the density and magnetic spectra shows that both steepen near the electron scales. Notably, the density spectrum exhibits slopes close to $-10/3$, while the magnetic spectrum becomes consistently steeper than the density spectrum at scales smaller than $\rho_e$, indicating that the turbulence becomes electrostatic. These results are consistent with theoretical predictions of an electron entropy cascade, which may explain the irreversible dissipation of turbulent energy at sub-$\rho_e$ scales. The magnetic spectrum, however, is not as steep as expected for the electron entropy cascade, which may be due to limited signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of weakly damped electromagnetic fluctuations near $\rho_e$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">159.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anderson self-localization of light in pair plasmas</a><span class="id">[2509.20594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that in pair plasma weakly nonlinear electromagnetic waves, $a_0 \leq 1$, experience Anderson self-localization.

In this work, we revisit LGTs and derive two new results. First, we show that the global symmetries already identified in the literature can be extended to local infinite-dimensional symmetries. The associated generators depend on arbitrary functions of time, and generate low-multipole modes that modify the mean curvature energy and the angular momentum of the patch, demonstrating their physical nature. We propose to interpret these low-multipole soft modes as a new cosmological-frame ambiguity that needs to be fixed prior to evaluating cosmological observables. Second, we demonstrate that the adiabatic cosmological perturbations generated by LGTs deform but preserve all the explicit and hidden Killing symmetries of the background geometry. As such, long-wavelength modes stand as a concrete example of algebraically-special cosmological perturbations of Petrov-type O, and inherit the conformal group as isometries and a set of four deformed Killing-Yano tensors and their associated Killing tensors.
