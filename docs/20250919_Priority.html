Their spatial proximity was assessed using photometric and astrometric data from \textit{Gaia} DR3. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), yielding 230 members for Alessi 36 and 342 members for Collinder 135. The mean proper-motion components ($\mu_\alpha \cos\delta, \mu_\delta$) were determined as $(-9.681 \pm 0.072, 7.021 \pm 0.081)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Alessi 36 and $(-10.061 \pm 0.083, 6.256 \pm 0.095)$ mas yr$^{-1}$ for Collinder 135. The parallax-based distances ($d$) were found to be $278 \pm 7$ and $299 \pm 11$ pc, while their estimated ages ($t$) were $39 \pm 5$ and $36 \pm 5$ Myr for Alessi 36 and Collinder 135, respectively. The Galactic orbital analysis of Alessi 36 and Collinder 135 reveals nearly circular orbits with low eccentricities and minor fluctuations in their apogalactic and perigalactic distances. The maximum heights they attain above the Galactic plane are $0.035 \pm 0.001$ kpc for Alessi 36 and $0.074 \pm 0.003$ kpc for Collinder 135, supporting their classification as part of the young stellar disc population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar velocity distributions in binary-rich ultrafaint dwarf galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.14316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultrafaint dwarf (UFD) galaxies are dominated by dark matter, the distribution of which may be inferred from the kinematics of that galaxy's stellar population. Star-by-star observations are available for the satellite UFD galaxies of the Milky Way, making them uniquely good laboratories in which to test cosmological predictions at the smallest scales. However, the kinematics of these galaxies are complicated by the presence of binary stars, which alter the stellar velocity distribution. In particular these binary stars increase the galaxy's stellar velocity dispersion, which is related to the total galactic mass by the virial theorem. Without correctly eliminating or accounting for binary stars we may therefore overestimate the masses of UFD galaxies or even confuse globular clusters for UFD galaxies. Here we write down the probability density function for the observed line-of-sight (LOS) velocity of a stellar population containing both visual and spectroscopic binary stars, which we then use to determine the effect of those binary stars on the observed LOS velocity dispersion. For the coldest UFD galaxies the fractional increase in LOS velocity dispersion is of order one and for the coldest globular clusters is of order 100. However, if the stellar initial mass function is bottom light, as it may be for UFD galaxies and globular clusters, then both of these values increase by half a dex.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuclear discs in disc galaxies: structural properties and scaling relations</a><span class="id">[2509.14319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of nuclear discs in barred disc galaxies has been demonstrated in studies on stellar structures and kinematics. It is thus imperative to establish their fundamental properties and scaling relations, which can help understanding their connection to other central stellar structures, including nuclear star clusters. In this Letter, we use results from the structural analysis and star formation histories of a sample of galaxies with nuclear discs to show the distributions of fundamental parameters and scaling relations. Our analysis shows that the nuclear disc mass-size relation, and the relation between the nuclear disc mass and the stellar mass of its host galaxy, are - at face value - different from the corresponding relations for nuclear star clusters, but marginally compatible given the uncertainties. This sets constraints to scenarios in which their formation is connected. We also find that the nuclear disc in the Milky Way is on the shorter end of the distribution of sizes set by nuclear discs in other galaxies. This is the first analysis of this kind for kinematically confirmed nuclear discs, and further understanding of the properties of the nuclear disc in the Milky Way and other galaxies is necessary to corroborate these results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14325" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The cosmic journey of dust grains - from nucleation to planetary system</a><span class="id">[2509.14325]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dust is essential to the evolution of galaxies and drives the formation of planetary systems. The challenge of inferring the origin of different presolar dust grains from meteoritic samples motivates forward modelling to understand the contributions of low- and high-mass stars to dust in our Solar System. In this work we follow the evolution of dust with tracer particles within a hydrodynamical simulation of a Milky Way-like isolated disc galaxy. We find that nearly half of the grains released from stars lose less than $10\%$ of their initial mass due to thermal sputtering in the interstellar medium (ISM), with an average degree of atomisation $\sim$$10\%$ higher for dust grains released by supernovae relative to asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star grains. We show through supernova remnant model variations that supernova (SN) dust survival is primarily shaped by the supernova bubble environment in the first million years (Myr) after the explosion rather than by its evolution during $10^2-10^3$ Myr in the ISM. The AGB/SN ratio of dust grains incorporated into newly formed stars approaches $0.8$ after a few hundred Myr of galactic evolution. Our analysis also shows that star-forming particles with short ($&lt;$$10$ Myr) free-floating time-scales in the ISM are predominantly released from supernovae rather than AGB stars. This implies that the Solar System budget of short-lived radioactive isotopes such as $^{26}$Al, whose decay contributed to melting and differentiating planetesimals, should have been provided by massive stars with masses $M \gtrsim 8$ M$_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic-ray impact on optical and mid-infrared emission line diagnostics in NGC 5728</a><span class="id">[2509.14328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic rays (CRs), from active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets and supernovae (SNe), serve as a significant feedback mechanism influencing emission lines in narrow line region (NLR) clouds. These highly energetic particles, propelled by shocks, heat the interstellar medium (ISM) and modify its chemical composition. This study investigates the role of CRs, particularly in their ability to excite gas and align with observed line ratios across UV and optical diagnostics. We employ CLOUDY to explore CR ionization rate, ionization parameter, and initial hydrogen density effects on optical and mid-infrared (MIR) emission. Our analysis includes high-quality optical data from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT) for NGC 5728, supplemented by infrared observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Our previous results indicate that CRs are instrumental in heating the inner regions of gas clouds, enhancing emission of low-ionization optical lines. Mid-infrared data reveal that emission lines like [Ar II] and [Ne II] within the JWST Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) field of view are sensitive to CRs. In contrast, high-ionization lines (for example, [Ne V]) serve as robust tracers of photoionization insensitive to CRs. Moreover, mixed optical and MIR diagnostics offer insight into the relative roles of CRs and shocks, which often produce similar signatures in emission lines. We find that while both mechanisms can elevate certain line ratios, their influence on MIR diagnostics diverges: shocks and CRs affect low-ionization lines differently, allowing for a better understanding when multi-wavelength data are available. Our approach not only helps to resolve the degeneracy between metallicity and CR ionization but also enables the potential differentiation of shocks and CR-driven processes in AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14368" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a nova super-remnant surrounding the recurrent nova LMCN 1971-08a in the Large Magellanic Cloud</a><span class="id">[2509.14368]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A nova super-remnant (NSR) is a greatly-extended structure grown by repeated nova eruptions sweeping the surrounding material away from a nova into a dense outer shell and are predicted to form around all novae. To date, four NSRs are known, with three located in the Galaxy and one residing in M31. Here we present the discovery of the first NSR in the Large Magellanic Cloud and only the second extragalactic nova shell to be identified, hosted by the recurrent nova LMCN 1971-08a. The structure is coincident with the nova, has a circular morphology and is visible in narrowband H$\alpha$ and [S II] filters but very faint in [O III], as expected. HI data also potentially reveal the existence of a coincident structure. Further, with a diameter of ${\sim}200$ pc, this NSR is the largest example yet found, with models indicating an ${\sim}4130 \ \text{M}_{\odot}$ shell expanding at ${\sim}20 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ into the surrounding medium and an age of $\sim$2.4 Myr. The existence of the NSR also suggests that LMCN 1971-08a may have a much shorter recurrence period than currently presumed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">200,000+ Deep Learning Inferred Periods of Stellar Variability from The All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2509.14423]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions, however these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1-30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giants stars which correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry and may prove useful for upcoming observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysis of the isotopologues of CS, CCS, CCCS, HCS+, HCCS+, and H2CS in TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey</a><span class="id">[2509.14425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed a detailed analysis of the isotopologues with 13C, 34S, 33S, and 36S of the sulphur-bearing molecules CS, CCS, CCCS,HCS+, HCCS+, and H2CS towards TMC-1 using the QUIJOTE1. The observations were obtained with the Yebes radio telescope. Observations with the IRAM 30m of the most abundant isotopologues of these species are also presented and used to estimate volume densities and to constrain the excitation conditions. We report the first detection in space of C13C34S, CC33S, CCC33S, HC33S+, and HCC34S+. C36S is also detected for the first time in a cold object. We also complemented with maps that provide the spatial distribution of most of these species. Using the available collisional rate coefficients for each species, we modeled the observed line intensities using the large velocity gradient method for the radiative transfer. We report the most complete analysis of the column densities of the CnS family and to compare the abundance ratios of all detected isotopologues. Adopting a T_k for TMC-1 of 9K, we found that n(H2)=0.9-1.5X10^4cm-3 can explain the observed decline in intensity with increasing J. We derived the rot. constants for the C13C34S, CC33S, CCC33S, HC33S+, and HCC34S+ isotopologues from new laboratory data and complemented them with the frequencies of the observed lines. We find that all S isotopologues are consistent with solar isotopic abundance ratios. Accurate 12C/13C abundances were derived and, as previously suggested, the 13C isotopologues of CCS and CCCS show strong abundance anomalies depending on the position of the substituted carbon. Nevertheless, the 12C/13C abundance ratio is practically identical to the solar value for CS, HCS+, and H2CS. We also searched for the isotopologues of other S-bearing molecules. The expected intensities for their 34S and 13C isotopologues are too low to be detected with the present sensitivity of the QUIJOTE, however.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Photometry of Globular Cluster Populations in MACS0417.5-1154</a><span class="id">[2509.14473]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Deep JWST imaging of the massive galaxy cluster MACS0417.5-1154, at redshift z=0.443, reveals a huge population of globular clusters (GCs) and Ultra-Compact Dwarfs (UCDs) primarily distributed around its single central giant galaxy (BCG). We present NIRCam/SWC photometry of the GC system in four bands (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W). The spatial distribution of the system matches well in radial and ellipticity profile with the high elongation (b/a = 0.5) of the BCG halo light. The total GC population within MACS0417 is estimated to be near 1.5 x 10^5, similar to the systems in Abell 2744, Coma, and other galaxy clusters with comparable masses. With similar results for GC photometry in hand from other lensing clusters at a range of redshifts, it is now possible to trace on purely observational grounds the luminosity evolution of GC systems over many Gigayears of lookback time, as seen through their color-magnitude diagrams. We show this sequence for five systems reaching to lookback times of more than 7 Gyr. A systematic change in the GC/UCD sequence with lookback time is clearly visible, near what is expected for age-fading of a simple stellar population with time. Lastly, we evaluate the effectiveness of the various JWST NIRCam filters for broadband photometry of GC systems as a function of redshift, as an aid to planning further studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Mechanism of Episodic Gas Accretion to the Central Region of Spiral Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.14487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We performed \textit{N}-body/SPH simulations of isolated spiral galaxies with various bulge-to-disk mass ratios ($M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$) from 0.02 to 0.2 to investigate mass transport from galactic scales (10 kpc) down to circumnuclear disk scales ($\lesssim$ 100 pc). Our analysis revealed these main findings, (1) Gravitational torque from stellar spiral arms causes gas accretion with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ along the gas spiral arms from a few kpc to a few 100 pc scale. The density of accreting gas is a few 100 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, comparable to the gas arms. The pressure gradient force is over an order of magnitude weaker than the stellar gravitational torque. (2) Gravitational torque from barred structure causes episodic gas clump accretion with $\sim1$ $M_\odot$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ on timescales of 10 Myr from kpc to a few 100 pc scale. The densities of these clumps exceed 700 ${\rm cm^{-3}}$, and this accretion occurs along elliptical orbits with a delayed phase relative to the bar potential \citep{wada1994}. (3) Episodic gas clumpy accretion is important for galactic center instability, confirmed by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$ = 0.02 but not by $M_{\rm bulge}/M_{\rm disk}$ = 0.1 and 0.2. This difference occurs because in the bulge-dominated potentials, bar instability is suppressed, and rapid gas clumps accretion does not occur. These findings suggest that gas clump accretion events driven by bars could be a source of high-density gas to the galactic center of the spiral galaxy, potentially promoting temporary activity in the galactic center.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metastable helium in the thermosphere</a><span class="id">[2509.14499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SPHEREx, a recently launched astronomy mission, detected a bright 1.083 micron emission feature in the commissioning data. The PI group attributed this feature to the He I 1.0833 micron triplet line. Here, I review the physics and aeronomy of this well-known line of atmospheric origin. SPHEREx is in a dawn-dusk sun-synchronous polar orbit, circling the earth nearly 15 times a day and observing close to the terminator plane. With a height of 650 km, SPHEREx is located in the upper thermosphere that is dominated by atomic oxygen and helium. The He I line is a result of resonance scattering of solar photons by metastable helium atoms. It appears that SPHEREx has the capacity to provide a rich dataset (global, daily, and 2-minute cadence) of column density of metastable helium in the upper thermosphere. As an example of this assertion, with data from just one orbit, the winter helium bulge was readily seen. Rapid variations in the column density of metastable helium is seen over the south pole which is probably due to spatial structure in the distribution of metastable helium as well as solar activity. Helium in the thermosphere is of considerable interest to operators of low-earth orbiting (LEO) satellites, since drag in the thermosphere is the primary cause of the decay of these satellites. SPHEREx, along with on-going ground-based studies (passive NIR spectroscopy, lidar, incoherent scatter radar), is poised to contribute to this topic.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of CH3+ in the O-rich planetary nebula NGC 6302</a><span class="id">[2509.14556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary nebulae are sites where ejected stellar material evolves into complex molecules, but the precise physical conditions and chemical routes that govern these processes are unclear. The presence of abundant carbon-rich molecules in O-rich environments poses particular challenges. Here we report the first detection of methyl cation (CH3+) in any planetary nebula, observed in the O-rich nebula NGC 6302 using JWST MIRI/MRS observations. CH3+ is a key driver of organic chemistry in UV-irradiated environments. Spatially resolved observations reveal that CH3+ is co-located with 12CO, H2, H II, HCO+, and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). LTE modelling of the CH3+ emission yields excitation temperatures of 500-800K in the inner bubble and torus, rising to 1000-2000K in the outer bubble of NGC 6302, with column densities ranging from  10^11 to 10^13 cm^-2. This detection demonstrates that hydrocarbon radical chemistry must be incorporated into planetary nebulae chemical models. Further near-IR observations are crucial to map different chemical networks operating in these environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical Enrichment of Isolated Relic Galaxy Mrk1216</a><span class="id">[2509.14613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate the chemical enrichment and structural evolution of the isolated elliptical relic galaxy Mrk1216 through X-ray observations. As a red-nugget relic, Mrk1216 provides a rare window into the early Universe, owing to its minimal interaction with the surrounding environment. Using data from the XMM-Newton telescope, we model the X-ray emission of its interstellar medium to derive radial temperature and abundance profiles. We find that the central region exhibits an elevated [Mg/Fe] ratio compared to typical early-type galaxies, consistent with a brief but intense star formation episode during its early assembly-a hallmark of relic systems. The nearly flat SNIa ratio profile ($R_{Ia} \sim 0.17$) extending to $\sim0.42R_{500}$ supports an early-enrichment scenario. These results highlight the importance of relic galaxies as benchmarks for studying early galaxy evolution and chemical enrichment. Future high-resolution missions and more advanced theoretical models incorporating more realistic initial mass functions are needed to fully assess their implications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal Disruption of Super Star Clusters as the origin of Bluish Light at the inner region of the Perseus Cluster Central Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2509.14616]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relatively blue light extends beyond a spiral disk from a radius of  5 kpc out to  14 kpc from the center of NGC 1275. Analyses of its spectrum and broadband colors reveal a population of young stars having sub-solar metallicities superposed on a dominant population of old stars having super-solar metallicities. The young stars have a characteristic age of  160 Myr and may span ages of a few hundred Myr, similar to that of stars comprising the central spiral disk, and a total mass about one-third that of this disk for a combined stellar mass (at birth) of  4 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$. A multitude of arc-like features embedded in the extended blue light have brightnesses comparable to the somewhat older ( 500 Myr) super star clusters (SSCs) projected against the central spiral disk. The SSCs have a relatively shallow mass function, suggesting that the tidal disruption of an initially larger population that we estimate could have had an initial total mass (far) exceeding  1 $\times$ 10$^9$ $\rm M_\odot$ gave rise to the extended blue light – the arc-like features corresponding to stellar streams tracing disrupted star clusters – and perhaps also the central spiral disk. We speculate that, beginning about 500 Myr ago, an enhanced episode of AGN activity in NGC 1275, leaving still visible X-ray bubbles, induced vigorous cooling of the intracluster medium to fuel the formation of numerous star clusters: many were tidally disrupted to leave bluish light at the inner region of this galaxy, with the survivors being the SSCs projected against the central spiral disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14669" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertical Structure of Interstellar Dust in the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2509.14669]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar dust plays a central role in the evolution of galaxies by shaping star formation, altering observed stellar properties, and redistributing radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. In the Milky Way, dust is concentrated in the Galactic disk and often associated with large-scale structures such as spiral arms and molecular clouds. Here we present a detailed analysis of the vertical distribution and substructure of interstellar dust using a sample of approximately 23 million stars from literature with high-precision extinction measurements. We derive three-dimensional dust density profiles along various sightlines and fit vertical dust distributions using both single and double exponential disk models across 12 Galactocentric radial bins from $\sim$6 to $\sim$12 kpc. We show that a two-component disk model–comprising a “thin” and a “thick” dust disk–provides a better fit to the vertical dust profile than a single exponential disk, as indicated by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) comparisons. The thin and thick disks have average scale heights of $81.0 \pm 6.7$ pc and $152.0 \pm 7.0$ pc, respectively. Our results also identify significant dust substructures, which align well with known spiral arms, molecular clouds, and star-forming regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MCI: Multi-Channel Imager on the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope</a><span class="id">[2509.14691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Multi-Channel Imager (MCI) is a powerful near-ultraviolet (NUV) and visible imager onboard the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST).

Below some hundreds of TeV, the sources of these cosmic rays are most likely Galactic. Hence, observations of high-energy gamma-rays and neutrinos can be used to probe the flux of cosmic rays in other parts of the Galaxy. Supernova remnants are usually considered as the prime candidate for the acceleration of Galactic cosmic rays. They inject cosmic rays in a point-like and specific time-dependent manner. As the precise positions and ages of the sources are not known, predictions must be obtained in a stochastic model. At GeV energies, the distribution of sources can be approximated with a smoothly varying spatial and temporal source density. At hundreds of TeV, however, the point-like nature matters as less sources contribute effectively due to shorter escape times. We have modelled diffuse emissions at hundreds of TeV, relevant for measurements by LHAASO, Tibet AS-gamma, IceCube, and the upcoming SWGO, as well as at tens of GeV, as measured by Fermi-LAT. This reveals the distinctive nature of diffuse emissions at the respective energies which can likely be used to constrain source models and locate cosmic ray sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first stars</a><span class="id">[2509.14799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Population III (or Pop. III) stars, the first stellar generation built up from metal-free primordial gas, first started to form at redshifts z   30. They formed primarily in small dark matter halos with masses of a few million solar masses. The cooling of the gas in these halos was dominated on all scales by molecular hydrogen. Current theoretical models indicate that Pop. III stars typically formed in small clusters with a logarithmically flat mass function due to widespread fragmentation in the protostellar accretion disks around these primordial stars. Massive Pop. III stars are thought to have played a pivotal role in shaping the early Universe, as their feedback regulates subsequent star formation, although the immediate effects of this feedback remain uncertain. Direct detection of Pop. III stars is challenging, but our chances of detecting at least a few Pop. III supernovae within the next decade are brighter. Indirect approaches based on stellar archaeology or gravitational wave detections offer promising constraints. Current observations suggest that most massive Pop. III stars ended their lives as core-collapse supernovae rather than pair-instability supernovae, offering insight into the initial mass function and evolutionary pathways of these primordial stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral survey of the diffuse gas toward BL Lac in the Q band</a><span class="id">[2509.14822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The chemical composition of diffuse interstellar clouds is not fully established. They host an active chemistry despite their relatively low density and the ubiquitous presence of far-UV radiation. To further explore the chemical composition of diffuse clouds, we performed a spectral scan toward the bright radio source BL Lac in the Q band (from 32 to 50 GHz) using the Yebes 40m telescope. Yebes observations were performed interleaving Frequency Switching and Position Switching integrations toward BL Lac, using a spectral resolution of 38 kHz. The data have been reduced with the CLASS software. We achieved an unprecedented sensitivity on the continuum of 0.02 - 0.07 %, allowing the detection of very faint absorption features. We confirm previous detections of HCS+, C3H, C3H+, CH3CN and HC3N in diffuse clouds and report new detections of CCS, C4H, CH3CHO, H2CCO , HNCO and H2CS along the line of sight to BL Lac, with abundances relative to H2 from a few 10{-11} to a few 10{-10}. We compiled molecular detections toward diffuse clouds to obtain the chemical inventory of a typical diffuse interstellar cloud. The chemical inventory of diffuse interstellar clouds includes complex organic species with up to four heavy atoms. These species are efficiently formed in the diffuse interstellar gas and reach abundances similar to those measured in dense photodissociation regions, pointing to similar gas phase chemical processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distance measurements from the internal dynamics of globular clusters: Application to the Sombrero galaxy (M 104)</a><span class="id">[2509.14948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Globular clusters (GCs) are dense star clusters found in all massive galaxies. Recent work has established that they follow a tight relation between their internal stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and luminosity, enabling accurate distance measurements. In this work, we aim to apply this GC velocity dispersion (GCVD) distance method to measure the distance to M 104 (NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy). We have measured internal stellar velocity dispersions for 85 globular clusters (GCs) and one ultra-compact dwarf galaxy around M 104 using high-resolution multi-object integrated-light spectroscopy with FLAMES/GIRAFFE on the Very Large Telescope. The measured velocity dispersions range from $\sigma = 4 - 30$ km s$^{-1}$, with a mean uncertainty of $\Delta\sigma = 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For a subset of 77 GCs with $V$-band magnitudes and reliable velocity dispersion measurements above $\sigma &gt; 4$ km s$^{-1}$, we constructed the $M_V$-$\sigma$ relation to measure the distance to M 104, finding $D=9.00\pm0.29$ (stat.) $\pm0.26$ (sys.) Mpc. The GCs follow the Milky Way and M 31 $M_V-\sigma$ relation closely, with the exception of the luminous ultra-compact dwarf SUCD1, which is nearly one magnitude brighter than the mean relation. 29 GCs in the sample have sizes determined from Hubble Space Telescope imaging which allowed us to determine their masses and $V$-band dynamical mass-to-light ratios (M/L$_V$). We find a mean $&lt;M/L_V&gt; = 2.6 \pm 0.8 M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$ for the luminous ($M_V &lt; -8$ mag) M 104 GCs, which is higher than the Milky Way GCs, but is reminiscent of the brightest GCs in Centaurus A. With the exception of SUCD1, the GCs of M 104 follow the GCVD relation irrespective of their mass-to-light ratio.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14983" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HerS-3: An Exceptional Einstein Cross Reveals a Massive Dark Matter Halo</a><span class="id">[2509.14983]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of HerS-3, a dusty star-forming galaxy at zspec = 3.0607, which is gravitationally amplified into an Einstein cross with a fifth image of the background galaxy seen at the center of the cross. Detailed 1-mm spectroscopy and imaging with NOEMA and ALMA resolve the individual images and show that each of the five images display a series of molecular lines that have similar central velocities, unambiguously confirming that they have identical redshifts. The HST F110W image reveals a foreground lensing group of four galaxies with a photometric redshift zphot 1.0. Lens models that only include the four visible galaxies are unable to reproduce the properties of HerS-3. By adding a fifth massive component, lying south-east of the brightest galaxy of the group, the source reconstruction is able to match the peak emission, shape and orientation for each of the five images. The fact that no galaxy is detected near that position indicates the presence of a massive dark matter halo in the lensing galaxy group. In the source plane, HerS-3 appears as an infrared luminous starburst galaxy seen nearly edge-on. The serendipitous discovery of this exceptional Einstein cross offers a potential laboratory for exploring at small spatial scales a nuclear starburst at the peak of cosmic evolution and studying the properties of a massive dark matter halo associated with the lensing galaxy group.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turn up the light: Radiative efficiency of protostars at birth</a><span class="id">[2509.15009]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early stages of stellar birth comprise of a two-step process involving the formation of two hydrostatic cores. The second step of gravitational collapse sets the radiative efficiency and accretion rate of the young protostar. These two parameters, of prime importance for protostellar evolution, dictate the luminosities and thus play a key role in deciphering the current discrepancy between observational surveys and theoretical models. In this letter, we provide quantitative estimates on the evolution of the radiative efficiency and accretion rate obtained from self-consistent, high-resolution, radiative hydrodynamic simulations performed using the codes PLUTO and RAMSES. The main highlight of our result is that the radiative efficiency reaches unity, that is, supercriticality, relatively quickly after protostellar birth. Supercriticality at the accretion shock is a necessary condition for cold accretion. Our results thus support a rapid transition to the cold accretion scenario, which is one of the assumptions used in Pre-Main Sequence (PMS) models working towards solutions to explain observational data. We briefly discuss the implications of the time evolution of the radiative efficiency factor in the context of the luminosity problem, the Protostellar Luminosity Function (PLF), PMS evolution, accurate sink properties, and the stellar Initial Mass Function (IMF).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES).

Surface Gravity Estimation and Giant-Dwarf Separation with the DDO51 Filter</a><span class="id">[2509.15112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reliable estimation of stellar surface gravity (log $g$) for a large sample is crucial for evaluating stellar evolution models and understanding galactic structure; However, it is not easy to accomplish due to the difficulty in gathering a large spectroscopic data set. Photometric sky survey using a specific filter, on the other hand, can play a substantial role in the assessment of log $g$. The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) utilizes eight filters to provide accurate stellar parameters for $\sim10^{7}$ stars, with its DDO51 intermediate-band filter specifically designed for robust log $g$ determination. In this work, the observed SAGES $u_{\rm SC}$ and $v_{\rm SAGES}$ photometry, the synthetic photometry in $g$, $r$, $i$, and DDO51 bands derived from \textit{Gaia} XP spectra are employed to investigate the importance of the DDO51 filter in the determination of log $g$. We applied machine-learning-based extinction correction and employed XGBoost models, trained on stellar parameters from LAMOST, to predict log $g$ using photometric data. By comparing model predicted log $g$ with LAMOST values, we find that including DDO51 filter improve the accuracies of log $g$ estimates by 21.0\% (from 0.224 dex to 0.177 dex) overall, and by 26.5\% (from 0.302 dex to 0.222 dex ) for GK-type stars, as compared to those obtained without DDO51. The DDO51 filter is also validated to be particularly effective for metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]$&lt;$-1.0), where it significantly mitigates systematic biases. Our findings highlight the diagnostic power of the SAGES DDO51 filter, providing enhanced stellar characterization vital for future in-depth studies of the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LOFAR 58 MHz Legacy Survey of the 3CRR Catalog</a><span class="id">[2509.15115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) is uniquely able to perform deep, 15&quot; resolutions imaging at frequencies below 100 MHz. Observations in this regime, using the Low Band Antenna (LBA) system, are significantly affected by instrumental and ionospheric distortions. Recent developments in calibration techniques have enabled routine production of high-fidelity images at these challenging frequencies. The aim of this paper is to obtain images of the radio sources included in the Third Cambridge catalog, second revised version (3CRR), at an observing frequency of 58 MHz, with an angular resolution of 15&quot;and sensitivity to both compact and diffuse radio emission. This work also aims to produce accurate flux measurements for all sources. This dataset is designed to serve as a reference for low-frequency radio galaxy studies and future spectral aging analyses. We deliver 58. MHz radio images for the complete 3CRR sample including flux density measurements. We determined that the LBA has an accurate flux density scale with an average flux uncertainty of 10%. This is an important confirmation for any future works using the LOFAR LBA system. With these results we characterize the bright radio galaxy population with new high-resolution low-frequency images. We also provide high-resolution models of these sources which will be useful for calibrating future surveys. This legacy survey significantly expands the available high-resolution data at low frequencies and is the first fully imaged high-resolution sample at ultra low frequencies (&lt; 100 MHz). It lays the foundation for future studies of radio galaxy physics, low-energy cosmic-ray populations, and the interplay between radio jets and their environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The evolution of complex organic molecules during star formation</a><span class="id">[2509.15126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complex organic molecules (COMs) are thought to be the precursors of pre-biotic molecules and are observed in many protostellar sources. For this paper we studied the formation of COMs during star formation and their evolution in the midplane of the circumstellar disk up to the end of the Class I stage. We used the Analytical Protostellar Environment (APE) code to perform analytical simulations of star formation and the Nautilus code to model the chemical evolution. Most COMs mainly form during the collapse or in the disk, except the lightest (CH3CCH, C3H6, CH3OH, CH3CHO, CH3OCH3, C2H5OH, CH3CN, CH3NC, C2H3CN, and CH3SH), which are significantly inherited by the disk from the prestellar phase. Over the first 150 kyr of the disk, the abundances of several COMs in the midplane vary negligibly (e.g., CH3CCH, CH3OH, and CH3CN), while others experience a variation of one order of magnitude (e.g., C2H3CHO HOCH2CHO, and CH3COCH2OH). Changing physical conditions also have an impact on the abundance profiles of COMs in the disk, and their inheritance. For example, increasing the temperature of the molecular cloud from 10 K to 15 K significantly promotes the formation of COMs in the prestellar phase, notably c-C2H4O and N-bearing species. Conversely, increasing the cloud mass from 2 Msol to 5 Msol only has a minor effect on the disk abundances in the early stages.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influence of the Spectral Energy Distribution of Reionization-Era Sources on the Lyman-$α$ Forest</a><span class="id">[2509.15179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interpreting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest properties during the epoch of reionization requires assumptions about the spectral energy distribution (SED) of ionizing sources. These are often simplified to blackbody or power-law spectra, potentially overlooking contributions from high-energy processes. In this work, we investigate how different SED models of reionization-era sources shape the thermal and ionization state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) and imprint on the Ly$\alpha$ forest during the late stages of reionization. We perform $3D$ radiative transfer simulations with CRASH, post-processed on Sherwood-type hydrodynamical outputs, exploring both physically motivated SEDs including X-ray binaries, Bremsstrahlung from shock-heated interstellar medium, and binary stars and idealized blackbody and power-law spectra. While the large-scale morphology of ionized regions is broadly similar across all models, harder spectral components extend partially ionized zones, produce larger He III regions, and heat the surrounding IGM. By adopting simplified spectra there is the risk of underestimating the contribution of high-energy sources, which subtly alter the effective optical depth, the flux power, and the local transmissivity, potentially biasing constraints on the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. The differences across models are most pronounced in the behavior of the proximity zone and in the power at intermediate scales, offering the most promising diagnostics to disentangle source populations. With upcoming high precision measurements from ELT and DESI, realistic SED modelling will be essential for robustly connecting Ly$\alpha$ forest observations to the sources driving the end of reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme magnetic fields around black holes</a><span class="id">[2407.15929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent results of the event horizon-scale images of M87* and Sagittarius A* from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration show that strong magnetic fields are likely present around the central black holes (BHs) in these sources.

Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge about the magnetic field evolution in numerical simulations of accreting BHs, focusing on jet launching, black hole-interstellar medium feedback, and black hole imaging of MADs.

Long-Timescale Variables including Wide Binary and Late Thermal Pulse Candidates</a><span class="id">[2502.18651]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this second paper on our variability survey of central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe) using ZTF, we report 11 long-timescale variables with variability timescales ranging from months to years. We also present preliminary analyses based on spectroscopic and/or photometric follow-up observations for six of them. Among them is NGC 6833, which shows a $980$ day periodic variability with strange characteristics: `triangle-shaped' brightening in $r$, $i$, and WISE bands but almost coincidental shallow dips in the $g$-band. The most plausible explanation is a wide binary with the photometric period being the orbital period. Long-period near-sinusoidal variability was detected in two other systems, NGC 6905 and Kn 26, with periods of $700$ days and $230$ days, respectively, making them additional wide-binary candidates. The latter also shows a short period at $1.18$ hours. We then present CTSS 2 and K 3-5, which show brightening and significant reddening over the whole ZTF baseline. A stellar model fit to the optical spectrum of CTSS 2 reveals it to be one of the youngest post-AGB CSPNe known. Both show high-density emission-line cores. We propose these to be late-thermal-pulse candidates, currently evolving towards the AGB phase. We then present recent HST/COS ultraviolet spectroscopy of the known wide-binary candidate LoTr 1, showing that the hot star is a spectroscopic twin of the extremely hot white dwarf in UCAC2 46706450. Similar to this object, LoTr 1 also has a fast-rotating wide subgiant companion. We suggest that the long photometric period of 11 years is the binary orbital period. Finally, we briefly discuss the ZTF light curves of the remaining variables, namely Tan 2, K 3-20, WHTZ 3, Kn J1857+3931, and IPHAS J1927+0814. With these examples, we present the effectiveness of the von Neumann statistics and Pearson Skew-based metric space in searching for long-timescale variables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aeos: The Impact of Pop III Initial Mass Function and Star-by-Star Models in Galaxy Simulations</a><span class="id">[2502.20433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the effect of variations in the Population III (Pop III) initial mass function (IMF) and star-by-star feedback on early galaxy formation and evolution using the Aeos simulations. We compare simulations with two different Pop III IMFs: $M_\text{char} = 10 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 100 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos10) and $M_\text{char} = 20 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_{\rm max} = 300 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (Aeos20). Aeos20 produces significantly more ionizing photons, ionizing 30% of the simulation volume by $z \approx 14$, compared to 9% in Aeos10. This enhanced ionization suppresses galaxy formation on the smallest scales. Differences in Pop III IMF also affect chemical enrichment. Aeos20 produces Population II (Pop II) stars with higher abundances, relative to iron, of light and $\alpha$-elements, a stronger odd-even effect, and a higher frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars. The abundance scatter between different Pop II galaxies dominates the differences due to Pop III IMF, though, implying a need for a larger sample of Pop II stars to interpret the impact of Pop III IMF on early chemical evolution. We also compare the Aeos simulations to traditional simulations that use single stellar population particles. We find that star-by-star modeling produces a steeper mass-metallicity relation due to less bursty feedback. These results highlight the strong influence of the Pop III IMF on early galaxy formation and chemical evolution, emphasizing the need to account for IMF uncertainties in simulations and the importance of metal-poor Pop II stellar chemical abundances when studying the first stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Supermassive Black Hole in a Diminutive Ultra-compact Dwarf Galaxy Discovered with JWST/NIRSpec+IFU</a><span class="id">[2503.00113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The integral-field unit mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec+IFU) mounted on the James Webb Space Telescope has now enabled kinematic studies of smaller and less massive compact stellar systems in which to search for central massive black holes (BHs) than ever before.

We report a $3\sigma$ detection of a central black hole with mass ${\cal M}_{BH}=2.2\pm1.1\times10^6\,M_\odot$ in UCD736 orbiting within the Virgo galaxy cluster based on Schwarzschild's modeling of the 1D kinematic profile. The presence of such a massive BH strongly argues against a globular cluster origin of this UCD, and rather suggests a tidally stripped formation route from a former $\gtrsim10^9\,M_\odot$ dwarf galaxy host. Two other methods produce results consistent with Schwarzschild's modelling, but can only provide upper-limits on ${\cal M}_{BH}$. This represents the detection of a BH in the most compact ($r_h\approx15\,{\rm pc}$) stellar system to date, with a ${\cal M}_{BH}$ corresponding to  9 percent of the system's stellar mass, roughly in line with previously reported UCD BH detections and comparable to the BH detected in the compact elliptical galaxy NGC4486B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey: View of the Fornax galaxy cluster</a><span class="id">[2503.02884]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Fornax cluster is one of the closest X-ray-bright galaxy clusters.

We compared the results to those from a recent numerical simulation of the local Universe (SLOW) and correlated the X-ray emission distribution with that of other tracers, including cluster member galaxies, ultra-compact dwarf galaxies, intracluster globular clusters, and HI-tail galaxies. We detect X-ray emission beyond the virial radius, R100=2.2 deg. In the inner regions within R500, we see previously known features, such as a large-scale spiral-shaped edge; however, we do not find obvious evidence of the bow shock several hundred kpc south of the cluster center predicted by previous numerical simulations of the Fornax cluster. Instead, we discover emission fingers beyond R500 to the west and southeast and excesses that stretch out far beyond the virial radius. They might be due to gas being pushed outward by the previous merger with NGC 1404 or due to warm-hot gas infall along large-scale filaments. Intriguingly, we find the distributions of the other tracers - galaxies and globular clusters - to be correlated with the X-ray-excess regions, favoring the infall scenario. Interestingly, we also discover an apparent bridge of low-surface-brightness emission beyond the virial radius connecting to the Fornax A galaxy group, which is also traced by the member galaxy and globular cluster distribution. The gas distribution in the SLOW simulation shows similar features as those we have discovered with eROSITA. With eROSITA, we witness the growth of a cluster along large-scale filaments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broad line region echo from highly accreting intermediate-mass black hole candidate SDSS J144850.08+160803.1.

Constraints on the BLR radius for IMBH candidates across a broad range of Eddington ratios help probe the unexplored faint end of the radius-luminosity ($R-L$) relation in AGNs. This opens up the opportunity to build a more robust $M_{BH}$ estimator. The present study is aimed at: (a) confirming a highly accreting IMBH candidate and (b) demonstrating the feasibility of the first photometric BLR RM campaign for IMBHs with high Eddington rates. SDSS J144850.08+160803.1 was identified as an IMBH candidate from a broad H$\alpha$-selected spectroscopic sample from SDSS. We carried out XMM-Newton X-ray observations to confirm its AGN status, along with narrowband H$\alpha$ and broadband SDSS g' monitoring over five months (March-July 2024) using a 60-cm telescope at the Caucasus Mountain Observatory. These time series allowed us both to probe the short-timescale variability and extract the time lag between the BLR and AD continuum. XMM-Newton detected J1448+16 as a bright X-ray point source with a photon index of $\Gamma = 2.32^{+0.15}_{-0.13}$ and X-ray luminosity of $L_{2-10\,\rm{keV}}=(3.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$, confirming its AGN activity. From the SDSS optical spectrum and X-ray properties, we estimated a BH mass of $\sim(0.9-2.4)~\times10^{5}M_{\odot}$ and Eddington rate of $\sim37-112\%$. We report high-amplitude $\sim55\%$ intra-night ($\sim1.7$ h) H$\alpha$ variability for this IMBH and extract a tentative BLR RM radius estimate of $\sim1-8~\mathrm{days}$. This work is a proof of concept for further high-Eddington-rate IMBH variability studies and BLR RM campaigns, which will be essential for an efficient calibration of the $R-L$ relation at the faint end.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pop-cosmos: Insights from generative modeling of a deep, infrared-selected galaxy population</a><span class="id">[2506.12122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an extension of the pop-cosmos model for the evolving galaxy population up to redshift $z\sim6$.

The generative model includes a flexible distribution over 16 stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameters, and a depth-dependent photometric uncertainty model, both represented using score-based diffusion models. We use the trained model to predict scaling relationships for the galaxy population, such as the stellar mass function, star-forming main sequence, and gas-phase and stellar metallicity vs. mass relations, demonstrating reasonable-to-excellent agreement with previously published results. We explore the connection between mid-infrared emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-formation rate, finding high AGN activity for galaxies above the star-forming main sequence at $1\lesssim z\lesssim 2$. Using the trained population model as a prior distribution, we perform inference of the redshifts and SPS parameters for 429,669 COSMOS2020 galaxies, including 39,588 with publicly available spectroscopic redshifts. The resulting redshift estimates exhibit minimal bias ($\text{median}[\Delta_z]=-8\times10^{-4}$), scatter ($\sigma_\text{MAD}=0.0132$), and outlier fraction ($6.19\%$) for the full $0&lt;z&lt;6$ spectroscopic compilation. These results establish that pop-cosmos can achieve the accuracy and realism needed to forward-model modern wide–deep surveys for Stage IV cosmology.

Eccentric binaries can form in dense stellar environments such as globular clusters or active galactic nuclei, or from triple stellar systems in the Galactic field. However, confidently measuring eccentricity is challenging – short signals from high-mass eccentric mergers can mimic spin-induced precession, making the two effects hard to disentangle. This degeneracy weakens considerably for longer-duration signals. Here, GW200208_222617 provides a rare opportunity. Originating from a relatively low-mass binary with source-frame chirp mass $\sim20$ M$_\odot$, its gravitational-wave signal spanned $\sim14$ orbital cycles in band, with no indication of data quality issues. Previous analyses for quasi-circular binaries found no evidence for spin precession, and multiple subsequent studies found the data to favour an eccentric merger despite notable technical differences. All in all, we believe GW200208_222617 is the black-hole merger event from GWTC-3 with the least ambiguous detection of eccentricity. We present a critical discussion of properties and astrophysical interpretation of GW200208_222617 as an eccentric black-hole merger using models of field triples, globular clusters, and active galactic nuclei. We find that if GW200208_222617 was indeed eccentric, its origin is consistent with a field triple or globular cluster. Formation in the inner regions of an active galactic nucleus is disfavoured. The outer regions of such a disk remain a viable origin for GW200208_222617; we demonstrate how future detections of eccentric mergers formed in such environments could be powerful tools for constraining the disk geometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet-Driven Formation of Bipolar Rings in Planetary Nebulae: Numerical Simulations Inspired by NGC 1514</a><span class="id">[2507.23670]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of jets launched into a dense shell, reproducing two rings in a bipolar structure that resemble the two dusty rings of the planetary nebula (PN) NGC 1514. The scenario we simulate assumes that a strong binary interaction enhanced the mass loss rate from the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stellar progenitor of NGC 1514, and shortly thereafter, the main-sequence companion accreted mass from the AGB star, launching a pair of jets. We find that adiabatic flows, where radiative losses are negligible, produce prominent rings, as observed in the infrared in NGC 1514. In contrast, when radiative cooling is significant, the rings are thin and faint. Our results reinforce the prevailing notion that jets play a substantial role in shaping planetary nebulae (PNe). More generally, as the binary companion to the central star of NGC 1514 avoided common envelope evolution, our results suggest that jets play a major role in many binary systems experiencing stable mass transfer at high rates. This conclusion complements the view that jets play a significant role in unstable mass transfer, specifically in common envelope evolution. Studies of strongly interacting binary systems, whether stable or not, should include jets. If jets continue to be active after ring formation, the outcomes are circum-jet rings, as observed in some other PNe and core-collapse supernova remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA-QUARKS survey: Extensive detection of acetamide in multiple high-mass star-forming regions</a><span class="id">[2509.01904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Acetamide (CH$_{3}$CONH$_{2}$), a key interstellar amide and a methyl derivative of formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO), has been sparsely detected, limiting insights into its prebiotic relevance. We present the first systematic survey for acetamide toward 52 hot molecular cores using ALMA Band 6 data. Acetamide has been detected in 10 cores, markedly expanding the inventory of known emitters. The derived column densities of acetamide range from $(2.5\pm0.9)\times10^{14}$ to $(1.5\pm0.6)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$, compared to formamide's $(1.1\pm0.1)\times10^{15}$ to $(6.9\pm0.4)\times10^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$. The nearly constant abundance ratios ( 3-9) and strong abundance correlation between the two amides across sources suggest a chemically linked formation pathway, likely on grain surfaces. The presence of peptide-like molecules in these regions implies that complex organic species can survive star formation processes, offering a potential pathway toward prebiotic chemistry. These findings constrain the dominant grain surface formation routes of acetamide, confirm its broader prevalence in highmass star-forming regions, and underscore the importance of targeted amide surveys in tracing the chemical evolution toward prebiotic complexity.</p></div></details></article>

Since we constrain vector instead of coordinates, this methodology allows to apply TFC to multiple and complex constraints composed by any types of nonlinear components included. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on Earth-to-Moon transfers, showing that this segmented approach achieves solutions with several orders of magnitude greater accuracy and efficiency in comparison with unsegmented orbit transfers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mapping the SO2 Shoreline in Gas Giant Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2509.14318]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST has revealed sulfur chemistry in giant exoplanet atmospheres, where molecules such as SO2 trace photochemistry, metallicity, and formation and migration. To ascertain the conditions that determine whether (or how much) SO2, H2S, and other sulfur-bearing species are present in exoplanet atmospheres, we present a grid of planetary atmospheres covering metallicities from 0.3-1000x Solar and temperatures from 250-2050 K. These models map out the 'SO2 shoreline,' the region of metallicity and irradiation for which SO2 may be sufficiently abundant to be detectable. SO2 is a sensitive indicator of metallicity; expected SO2 abundances also depend strongly on overall temperature and C/O ratio; the SO2 abundance depends surprisingly weakly on XUV irradiation, also weakly on Kzz (for Teq &gt; 600 K), and is essentially independent of internal temperature. Despite its detection in a growing number of giant planets, SO2 is never the dominant sulfur-bearing molecule: depending on temperature and metallicity, H2S, S2, NS, SO, SH, and even S8 or atomic S are frequently as common (or more so) as SO2. Nonetheless SO2 remains the most easily detectable sulfur-bearing species, followed by H2S, though perhaps SO and SH could be detectable in some gas giants. Aside from a pressing need for additional observational constraints on sulfur, we also identify the need for future work to account for the effects of clouds and hazes, fully self-consistent atmospheric models, 2D and 3D models, a wider range of planetary masses and radii, and studies to measure and refine reaction rates and molecular opacities of sulfur-bearing species</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Telescope Tilt System for the POEMMA Balloon Radio Mission</a><span class="id">[2509.14333]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Probe of Extreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics Balloon with Radio mission (PBR) will point above Earth's limb to measure PeV energy cosmic rays, and record star images to monitor optical focusing in situ.

HWO aims to revolutionize exoplanet exploration by performing direct imaging and spectroscopy of 25 or more habitable exoplanets, and to resolve a broad range of astrophysics science questions as well. Since exoplanet yield depends critically on the detector dark count rate, as we show in this paper, the ambitious goals of HWO require arrays of single-photon energy-resolving detectors. We argue that Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) are best suited to meet these requirements. To support the detectors required for HWO and future far-IR missions, at the required power consumption and detector count, we are developing a radiation-tolerant reconfigurable readout system for both imaging and energy-resolving single photon KID detector arrays. We leverage an existing RFSoC-based system we built for NASA balloons that has a power consumption of 30 Watts and reads out 2000-4000 detectors (i.e. 7-15 mW/pixel), and move to a radiation tolerant Kintex Ultrascale FPGA chip to bring low-power wide bandwidth readout to a space-qualified platform for the first time. This improves significantly over previous spaceflight systems, and delivers what is required for NASA's future needs:  100,000 pixels with less than 1 kW total power consumption. Overall, the system we are developing is a significant step forward in capability, and retires many key risks for the Habitable Worlds Observatory mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study of an Isolated Double-pulse Cosmic Ray Candidate Recorded with the Askaryan Radio Array</a><span class="id">[2509.14407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radio-frequency emissions produced by particle showers on Earth, resulting from cosmic rays (CRs) and ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$\nu$) originating from astrophysical sources share significant similarities, enabling radio detectors initially designed for UHE-$\nu$ searches to also study CRs. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), an experiment currently operating within the ice at the South Pole, is primarily designed to detect UHE-$\nu$s. To date, ARA has deployed five stations, with each station equipped with antennas installed at depths up to 200 meters in the ice. Data recorded by ARA Station-2 (A2) suggest a potential CR origin for a subset of events identified in a UHE-$\nu$ search. This subset includes a double-pulse event potentially from a downward propagating CR-induced air shower, with in-air geomagnetic emission followed by in-ice Askaryan emission producing the two pulses. A detailed investigation of this CR candidate event using comprehensive simulations has been conducted with the goal of identifying the parameters of a CR-induced air shower that best match the experimentally observed quantities. We simulate predicted CR signals in ARA by combining an impacting CR shower simulation framework (FAERIE) with a realistic detector simulation (AraSim). We determine the event topology based on the vertex reconstruction of both the putative geomagnetic and Askaryan signals. After inferring the event geometry, we show that the simulation matches the observed time structure of the event (channel-by-channel relative signal arrival times) for the recorded event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the ARM cut in Compton gamma-ray imaging and its application to the INSPIRE detector</a><span class="id">[2509.14511]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Compton camera is a gamma-ray imaging device developed in the 1970s. In the 1990s, the COMPTEL detector onboard the CGRO was the first to utilize a Compton camera for MeV all-sky survey observations. Recently, various Compton cameras have been developed using scintillators, semiconductors, and gas detectors, some of which are intended for future small satellite missions as well as medical applications. However, the image obtained by a Compton camera has strong artifacts owing to the overlap of the Compton cones or the arcs, which degrade the resolution and sensitivity of the image. In this study, we revisit the adaptive ARM cut that significantly reduces artifacts when the direction of gamma ray emitting source is already known. This approach complements the statistically well-defined method based on the response function in the three-dimensional data space of scattering direction (\chi, \psi) and scattering angle \theta, but it is more direct, intuitive, and simplifies the extraction of spectra in astronomical observations of point-like sources. Using a Compton camera, INSPIRE, onboard the ultra-small satellite GRAPHIUM as an example, we numerically evaluated the extent of background reduction to estimate simulation-based sensitivity. The method was also applied to actual measurements using a quarter-scale prototype of INSPIRE to extract spectra from multiple sources within the same field of view.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Spherical geometry: Unraveling complex features of objects orbiting around stars from its transit light curve using deep learning</a><span class="id">[2509.14875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena. This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from transiting systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring dark matter with quantum-enhanced haloscopes and time projection chambers</a><span class="id">[2509.14897]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This thesis explores experimental and theoretical approaches to dark matter detection, from gas-based detectors to quantum sensors, tackling the challenge of identifying dark matter, which makes up 27% of the Universe's energy.

By analyzing these recordings, the properties of the original VHE particle-such as its type, energy, and direction of arrival-can be reconstructed through machine learning techniques. This contribution focuses on the Large-Sized Telescopes (LSTs) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, a next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory.

Accurate calibration is crucial for the optimal operation of the NectarCAM, ensuring precise gain computation and mitigating differences in light-collection efficiency of the pixels of the camera. Using the flat-field flasher, two informations are obtained : the pixel gain and the relative efficiency between pixels.

In this study, we report on the performance characterisation of the flat-field flasher using a dedicated test bench. We report on the results of tests conducted on several flasher units, evaluating their reliability. Furthermore, we describe how the flat-field coefficients are applied within the camera to ensure uniformity of response of few percent level across all 1855 pixels.

To address these objectives, PUNCH uses a constellation of four small spacecraft in Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit, to collect linearly polarized images of the K corona and young solar wind. The four spacecraft each carry one visible-light imager in a 1+3 configuration: a single Narrow Field Imager solar coronagraph captures images of the outer corona at all position angles, and at solar elongations from 1.5° (6 R$_\odot$) to 8° (32 R$_\odot$); and three separate Wide Field Imager heliospheric imagers together capture views of the entire inner solar system, at solar elongations from 3° (12 R$_\odot$) to 45° (180 R$_\odot$) from the Sun. PUNCH images include linear-polarization data, to enable inferring the three-dimensional structure of visible features without stereoscopy. The instruments are matched in wavelength passband, support overlapping instantaneous fields of view, and are operated synchronously, to act as a single “virtual instrument” with a 90° wide field of view, centered on the Sun.

Using a synthetic population of compact binary mergers, we model each source's GW signal-to-noise ratio, sky localization uncertainty, kilonova (KN) light curves in optical and near-infrared bands, fluence of the relativistic jet gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission and afterglow light curves across radio, optical, X-ray and very high energy wavelengths. We analyze multi-messenger detectability prospects for ET as a standalone observatory with two different configurations and within a network of next-generation GW detectors. ET will detect over $10^4$ NSNS mergers annually, enabling potential observation of tens to hundreds of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. BHNS mergers have more limited multi-messenger prospects, but joint GW-EM rates will increase by an order of magnitude compared to current-generation instruments. We quantify uncertainties due to the NS equation of state (EoS) and mass distribution of NSNSs, as well as the NS EoS and BH spin for BHNSs. While a single ET will achieve an impressive GW detection rate, the fraction of well-localized events is orders of magnitude lower than in a network with additional detectors.

The smoothing-length approximation versus the exact self-gravity kernel</a><span class="id">[2506.10812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet-forming discs often contain structures like spiral arms, typically linked to the disc's gravitational forces. In 2D models, an ad hoc softening prescription is commonly used for self-gravity, but this overlooks the vertical structure's impact, suppresses the Newtonian nature of gravity at short distances and doesn't respect Newton's third law. To address these issues, associated with a Plummer potential approximation, we developed an exact self-gravity kernel for thin, hydrostatically supported discs, including a dust fluid component. Our analytical framework provides a precise 2D self-gravity prescription validated by benchmarks and 2D/3D numerical tests. The derived kernel, based on modified Bessel functions, maintains Newtonian gravitation features, such as point-wise symmetry, a smooth transition from light to massive discs and a singularity at zero distance, among others. In contrast to other prescriptions found in the literature, it proves capable of leading to an additional, and previously unnoticed, source of gravitational runaway discernible only at infinitesimal distances. We finally note that our new prescription remains compatible with methods based on the fast Fourier transform, affording superior computational efficiency. Our exact kernel formulation overcomes substantial limitations inherent in the smoothing-length approach. It permits a novel, fully consistent treatment of self-gravity in Gaussian-stratified thin discs. The approach, that makes the usage of the Plummer potential obsolete, will prove useful to studying all common planet formation scenarios, which are often backed by 2D-flat numerical simulations. Accordingly, in an accompanying paper, we will investigate how the occurence of the gravitational instability is affected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bayesian Framework for UHECR Source Association and Parameter Inference</a><span class="id">[2507.07856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The identification of potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains challenging due to magnetic deflections and propagation losses, which are particularly strong for nuclei. In previous iterations of this work, we proposed an approach for UHECR astronomy based on Bayesian inference through explicit modelling of propagation and magnetic deflection effects. The event-by-event mass information is expected to provide tighter constraints on these parameters and to help identify unknown sources. However, the measurements of the average mass through observations from the surface detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory already indicate that the UHECR masses are well represented through its statistical average. In this contribution, we present our framework which uses energy and mass moments of $\ln A$ to infer the source parameters of UHECRs, including the mass composition at the source. We demonstrate the performance of our model using simulated datasets based on the Pierre Auger Observatory and Telescope Array Project. Our model can be readily applied to currently available data, and we discuss the implications of our results for UHECR source identification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLARA: A Modular Framework for Unsupervised Transit Detection Using TESS Light Curves</a><span class="id">[2508.04722]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). Additionally, we perform Monte Carlo injection-recovery tests to assess feasibility, stability, justification and quantification of methods outlined. CLARA processed over 87,000 TESS SPOC light curves (Sectors 1-5).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for Deep-Learning-Based Mass Reconstruction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays using Simulated Air-Shower Profiles</a><span class="id">[2508.13933]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Knowledge of the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECR) is crucial to understanding their origins; however, current approaches have limited event-by-event resolution due to high intrinsic fluctuations of variables like $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $N_\mu$. With fluorescence telescope measurements of $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ in particular, there are opportunities to improve this situation by leveraging more information from the longitudinal shower development profile beyond just the depth at which its maximum occurs. Although there have been ML studies on extracting composition or mass groups from surface signals, parametrized profiles, or from derived parameters (e.g. $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ distributions), to our knowledge, we present the first study of a deep-learning neural-network approach to directly predict a primary's mass ($\ln A$) from the full longitudinal energy-deposit profile of simulated extensive air showers. We train and validate our model on a large suite of simulated showers, generated with CONEX and EPOS-LHC, covering nuclei from $A = 1$ to $61$, sampled uniformly in $\ln A$. After rescaling, our network achieves a maximum bias better than 0.4 in $\ln A$ on unseen test showers with a resolution ranging between 1.5 for protons and 1 for iron over a large range of noise conditions, corresponding to a proton-iron merit factor of 2.19, outperforming the predictive power of either $X_{\mathrm{max}}$ or $N_\mu$ alone. This performance is only mildly degraded when predictions are made on simulations using the Sibyll-2.3d hadronic interaction model, which was not used in training, showing these features are robust against model choice. Our results suggest that the full shower profile may contain latent composition-sensitive features which have as much discriminating power as $X_{\mathrm{max}}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Increasing science yield with a twilight observing program with the SCALES instrument at Keck</a><span class="id">[2509.13143]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While astronomical twilight closes the observing window for optical astronomers, the infrared sky remains dark even through sunrise, allowing IR astronomers to observe through twilight. The Slicer Combined with an Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (SCALES) instrument is a 2-5 micron coronagraphic integral field spectrograph scheduled to arrive at Keck in early 2026. SCALES has the potential to execute exciting science and support the astronomical community and upcoming NASA missions through a dedicated cadenced twilight observing program. We estimate that the current twilight observing program on Keck conducts 18+-1 hours per year of science observations; a facilitized twilight observing program that is prioritized by the observatory could yield 151+-2 hours of science time per year. This work presents the scientific motivation and high-level feasibility of two primary SCALES twilight science cases, monitoring of Solar System objects and a high-contrast imaging search for exoplanets around bright nearby stars, taking lessons from the existing NIRC2 and OSIRIS Twilight Zone program and considering increases in program scope. We also consider technical and operational challenges to overcome before the SCALES instrument begins its twilight observing program.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06416" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TESLA-X: An effective method to search for sub-threshold lensed gravitational waves with a targeted population model</a><span class="id">[2311.06416]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong gravitational lensing can produce copies of gravitational-wave signals from the same source with the same waveform morphologies but different amplitudes and arrival times. Some of these strongly-lensed gravitational-wave signals can be demagnified and become subthreshold. We present TESLA-X, an enhanced approach to the original GstLAL-based TargetEd Subthreshold Lensing seArch (TESLA) method, for improving the detection efficiency of these potential subthreshold lensed signals. TESLA-X utilizes lensed injections to generate a targeted population model and a targeted template bank. We compare the performance of a full template bank search, TESLA, and TESLA-X methods via a simulation campaign, and demonstrate the performance of TESLA-X in recovering lensed injections, particularly targeting a mock event. Our results show that the TESLA-X method achieves a maximum of $\sim 10\%$ higher search sensitivity compared to the TESLA method within the subthreshold regime, presenting a step towards detecting the first lensed gravitational wave. TESLA-X will be employed for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's collaboration-wide analysis to search for lensing signatures in the fourth observing run.</p></div></details></article></body>
