<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rapid Arrival of Josiah Willard Gibbs's Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics in European University Libraries</a><span class="id">[2509.10732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This note offers an overview of how Josiah Willard Gibbs's Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, published simultaneously in London and New York in 1902, spread through European university libraries. Contrary to the received idea that the circulation of this text was slow, information gathered through direct contacts with numerous academic libraries, together with an examination of Yale University's archives, reveals an unexpectedly rapid material diffusion beginning on 15 March 1902. This early propagation can be explained by several channels: presentation copies sent by Yale University to leading universities, personal mailings by Gibbs himself to prominent scientists, and the distribution of copies by the American publisher to major scientific journals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How are Scientific Concepts Birthed? Typing Rules of Concept Formation in Theoretical Physics Reasoning</a><span class="id">[2509.10740]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work aims to formalize some of the ways scientific concepts are formed in the process of theoretical physics discovery. Since this may at first seem like a task beyond the scope of the exact sciences (natural and formal sciences), we begin by presenting arguments for why scientific concept formation can be formalized. Then, we introduce type theory as a natural and well-suited framework for this formalization. We formalize what we call &quot;ways of discovering new concepts&quot; including concept distinction, property preservation, and concept change, as cognitive typing rules. Next, we apply these cognitive typing rules to two case studies of conceptual discovery in the history of physics: Einstein's reasoning leading to the impossibility of frozen waves, and his conceptual path to the relativity of time. In these historical episodes, we recast what a physicist might informally call &quot;ways of discovering new scientific concepts&quot; as compositional typing rules built from cognitive typing rules - thus formalizing them as scientific discovery mechanisms. Lastly, we computationally model the type-theoretic reconstruction of Einstein's conceptual path to the relativity of time as a program synthesis task.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Realist Approach to Quantum Individuality: Against the &quot;Received&quot; and &quot;Alternative&quot; Views</a><span class="id">[2509.10680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we address the contemporary debate about quantum individuality expressed as an opposition between those who, like Décio Krause, defend the reference of the theory to &quot;non-individual particles&quot;, and those like Dennis Dieks, who propose instead to preserve the notion of &quot;classical particle&quot; as commonly applied by contemporary physicists. We will argue that these viewpoints rather than truly opposed share a common methodology which has helped to reinforce the doctrine of classical concepts that was imposed by Bohr and Dirac within the &quot;standard&quot; formulation –which remains the orthodox physical account of the theory of quanta. We will also discuss a recently proposed relativist yet objective relational account of quantum individuality [25] which, going back to Einstein's methodological approach, opens the doors to a completely new, truly realist understanding of quantum individuality.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysics: a Modern Discipline with a Newtonian origin</a><span class="id">[2509.11886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the formation and evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) requires a thorough investigation of the key physical processes involved. While one pathway involves the isolated evolution of massive binary stars, affected by uncertain stages like core-collapse supernovae and common envelope evolution, an alternative channel is dynamical formation in dense stellar environments. Newtonian gravity has traditionally provided a robust and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale gravitational interactions. However, accurately capturing close encounters and black hole mergers necessitates the use of general relativity. This work focuses on assessing the applicability of post-Newtonian gravity in bridging these regimes, offering a physically insightful and computationally tractable approach to modeling BBH formation in the gravitational-wave era of astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do animals share space? An explanation to Zeno's paradox (of motion)</a><span class="id">[2503.06006]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, a solution to Zeno's paradox of motion was offered and a possible, based on observations and empirical viewpoint, interpretation. A gedanken experiment was proposed in accordance to our empirical and experimental paradigm, offering solutions from pendular energy and geometric gravity theory, the standard view, and classical physics, as a reply to Zeno's paradox (of motion), departing from the logical and overly mathematical frameworks, which either offered a solution detached from experiment and observations, the former, and a solution with neither explanation nor interpretation, the latter. It takes on the problem of unmeasurable regions, Zeno's paradoxes (measure and motion), and infinitesimals, offering some insights that could be found interesting for both, metaphysical and foundations of physics fields.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12055" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuclear Beavers</a><span class="id">[2509.12055]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nuclear physics is a very abstract field with little accessibility for wider audiences, and yet it is a field of physics with far reaching implications for everyday life. The Nuclear Beavers demonstration is a hands-on experience that offers an intuitive lens into nuclear structure and decay. We aim to provide a more accessible entry point for students and educators by substituting complex nuclear structures and interactions with tactile building blocks following well-defined rules, thereby opening nuclear physics concepts to the general public.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</a><span class="id">[2509.11997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's internal perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A stochastic approach in physics exercises of mathematics education</a><span class="id">[2410.04076]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a method for incorporating a stochastic point of view into physics exercises of mathematics education. The core of our method is the randomization of some inputs, the system model used does not differ from what we would use in the deterministic approach. We consider exercises from the theory of projectile motion and statics. The outputs of stochastic models are random variables, and we usually determine their probability distributions, expected values, variances, and relative standard deviations, and the probabilities of some events related to them are also calculated. Students and teachers familiar with elementary probability theory and mechanics may find these exercises useful for understanding some basic concepts of stochastic mechanics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quantum Technology Job Market: Data Driven Analysis of 3641 Job Posts</a><span class="id">[2503.19004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid advancement of Quantum Technology (QT) has created a growing demand for a specialized workforce, spanning across academia and industry. This study presents a quantitative analysis of the QT job market by systematically extracting and classifying thousands of job postings worldwide. The classification pipeline leverages large language models (LLMs) whilst incorporating a &quot;human-in-the-loop&quot; validation process to ensure reliability, achieving an F1-score of 89%: a high level of accuracy. The research identifies key trends in regional job distribution, degree and skill requirements, and the evolving demand for QT-related roles. Findings reveal a strong presence of the QT job market in the United States and Europe, with increasing corporate demand for engineers, software developers, and PhD-level researchers. Despite growing industry applications, the sector remains in its early stages, dominated by large technology firms and requiring significant investment in education and workforce development. The study highlights the need for targeted educational programs, interdisciplinary collaboration, and industry-academic partnerships to bridge the QT workforce gap.</p></div></details></article></body>
