Our high-resolution image discovers new small-scale features in the nebula, including an elliptical core of $40''\times20''$ surrounding the central pulsar and a $2'$-long arc wrapping around the core in the north. The latter shows a clear gap from the core, and it consists of a bright lobe in the northwest and a tongue-like structure in the northeast. These could be resulting from the pulsar wind interaction with the environment. Our polarization measurement reveals a highly ordered magnetic field with toroidal geometry. The small scale features are all highly linearly polarized. In particular, the lobe has a polarization fraction of $\sim$60%, close to the synchrotron limit. This is also much higher than the value measured at a lower frequency, implying significant depolarization. We show that this can be explained by Faraday rotation in the nebula, and we constructed a simple 3D model accordingly to infer a magnetic field strength of $\sim$50-105$\mu$G.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20248" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cloaking Cosmic Light</a><span class="id">[2602.20248]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Light crossing dark domain walls that source a top form coupled to gauge Chern–Simons terms mixing visible and dark $U(1)$ gauge fields generically converts into dark photons. The effect is entirely localized on the wall and requires no additional ingredients. The conversion rate is a sharp function of the photon frequency in the wall rest frame, vanishing above the ultraviolet cutoff of the top form sector. Partial cloaking may also induce a rotation of the polarization of transmitted light of order $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3}$ radians, modify the cosmic microwave background power spectrum, and violate Etherington's reciprocity relation at low frequencies. These effects can impact cosmological determinations of the Hubble rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The origin of isolated millisecond pulsars in globular clusters</a><span class="id">[2602.20250]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant fraction of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in globular clusters (GCs) are observed as isolated objects, despite the widely accepted scenario in which MSPs are formed through recycling in compact binary systems. The origin of these isolated objects therefore remains an open problem. In this Letter, we propose a physically motivated encounter rate per binary, $\Lambda \propto n a/(\sigma a_H)$, incorporating the local stellar density $n$, velocity dispersion $\sigma$, binary separation $a$, and the Heggie–Hills ionization radius $a_H$. Combined with companion ablation by the MSP, this rate successfully predicts the observed fraction of isolated MSPs in GCs, that is $\mathcal{F}_i \propto\Lambda \propto a_H^{-1}$, establishing dynamical ionization as the primary channel for producing isolated MSPs. We quantitatively test this model against a null hypothesis in which $\mathcal{F}_i$ is independent of $a_H$, and find that the ionization-driven model is 220 times more likely than the null hypothesis. Our framework naturally explains the observed overabundance of isolated MSPs in $\omega$ Centauri and establishes binary ionization as the primary mechanism responsible for the production of isolated MSPs in GCs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planet formation at the inner edge of the dead zone – I: the interplay between accretion outbursts and dust growth</a><span class="id">[2602.20283]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inner edge of the dead zone in protoplanetary disks has been shown to periodically go unstable, leading to accretion outbursts and annular substructure within the dead zone. While dust opacities play a key role in this process, the thermal and dynamical effects of dust drift and growth have not been fully explored. We investigate the evolution of accretion outbursts in the inner disk and their impact on the formation of dust-rich substructure with a fully dynamic dust model. In doing so, we aim to highlight the importance and limitations of dust growth in forming planets in this region. We carry out radiation hydrodynamics simulations of a protoplanetary disk including prescriptions for the structure of the inner edge of the dead zone, viscous and irradiation heating, radiative cooling, dust-gas dynamics, and dust evolution. We find that accretion outbursts at the inner disk edge can lead to the formation of multiple dust rings that extend deep inside the dead zone ( 1 au) and diffuse on viscous timescales ( 10 kyr for $\alpha$=1e-4). The rings contain dust masses of up to  1.6 Earth masses, possibly kickstarting planet formation. Dynamic modeling of dust fragmentation enhances the total opacity during the burst, yielding more intense outbursts that penetrate deeper into the dead zone. Our results highlight the thermal and dynamical importance of treating dust dynamics self-consistently in models of accretion outbursts. Additional modeling is needed to characterize the inevitable non-axisymmetric structures arising from accretion outbursts and their observational prospects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for Sympathetic Flaring in TESS Data</a><span class="id">[2602.20311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Most flares on the Sun occur at random, but there is a small percentage of &quot;sympathetic flaring&quot; – the triggering of one flare by another. Previously there had been no widespread confirmation of sympathetic flares on other stars. In this work, we developed a new flare detection algorithm that is sensitive to closely-separated and overlapping stellar flares. We applied it to TESS data and discovered   220,000 flares on   16,000 stars, the majority of which are M-dwarfs. The wait time distribution between flares demonstrates an excess of closely-separated flares, relative to expectations from a Poisson process. We attribute this to sympathetic flares, occurring at a rate of between 4% and 9%, which matches the rate seen on the Sun. Our result is the first statistically robust detection of sympathetic flares on other stars, demonstrating a commonality between the Sun and low-mass stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20316" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inspectorch: Efficient rare event exploration in solar observations</a><span class="id">[2602.20316]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Sun is observed in unprecedented detail, enabling studies of its activity on very small spatiotemporal scales. However, the large volume of data collected by our telescopes cannot be fully analyzed with conventional methods. Popular machine learning methods identify general trends from observations, but tend to overlook unusual events due to their low frequency of occurrence. We study the applicability of unsupervised probabilistic methods to efficiently identify rare events in multidimensional solar observations and optimize our computational resources to the study of these extreme phenomena. We introduce Inspectorch, an open-source framework that utilizes flow-based models: flexible density estimators capable of learning the multidimensional distribution of solar observations. Once optimized, it assigns a probability to each sample, allowing us to identify unusual events. We apply this approach by applying it to observations from the Hinode Spectro-Polarimeter, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph, the Microlensed Hyperspectral Imager at Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope, the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board Solar Orbiter. We find that the algorithm assigns consistently lower probabilities to spectra that exhibit unusual features. For example, it identifies profiles with very strong Doppler shifts, uncommon broadening, and temporal dynamics associated with small-scale reconnection events, among others. As a result, Inspectorch demonstrates that density estimation using flow-based models offers a powerful approach to identifying rare events in large solar datasets. The resulting probabilistic anomaly scores allow computational resources to be focused on the most informative and physically relevant events. We make our Python package publicly available at this https URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-variable Scattered Light in Herbig Disks Observed with Subaru/SCExAO</a><span class="id">[2602.20346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics (SCExAO) instrument, we present near-infrared K-band polarimetric imaging of nine Herbig stars selected from a volume-limited sample within 200 pc. We detect the disks around MWC 480, HD 163296, and HD 143006 for the first time with SCExAO, and compare these observations with previous VLT/SPHERE datasets to identify surface-brightness variability. In MWC 480, we resolve two azimuthal brightness dips near the disk minor axis and find evidence that one of them shifted between 2021 and 2022. In HD 163296, we identify an apparent linear azimuthal motion of a localized peak in polarized intensity along the outer ring over a 15-month baseline. The rapid motion of these features relative to the local Keplerian velocity suggests that the observed variability is driven by changing illumination rather than physical material this http URL to uncertainties in the underlying scattering background, however, we cannot determine the precise physical origin of the variability. No significant disk variability is detected in HD 143006 over a 10-month baseline. We also report the first detection of a protoplanetary disk using the fast-PDI mode on SCExAO, illustrating both the promise and current limitations of this observing mode. Finally, we report non-detections toward HD 144432, HD 56895, PDS 76, HIP 80425, HD 148352, and HIP 81474. All non-detections with Meeus classifications belong to Group II systems and are likely self-shadowed. For these six systems, we measure the system-integrated polarization fraction and angle of linear polarization, providing quantitative constraints on their unresolved circumstellar environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Constraints on Neutrino Masses in Quintessential Inflation</a><span class="id">[2602.20349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quintessential inflation provides a unified description of the early and late accelerated phases of the Universe, linking the inflationary epoch to the present-day dark energy-dominated era through a single scalar degree of freedom. In this work, we explore the implications of this unification for cosmological constraints on the sum of neutrino masses. Focusing on the $\alpha$-attractor scenario, we implement the model in a modified version of the Boltzmann solver CLASS to compute the relevant cosmological observables and perform a Bayesian parameter estimation analysis using data from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAOs), and Type Ia supernovae. The model naturally breaks the degeneracy between the dark energy equation of state and the total neutrino mass, yielding tight upper bounds of $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.067$ eV for flat spatial geometry and $\sum m_\nu&lt; 0.116$ eV when curvature is included. We also provide forecasts for future probes, showing that the Simons Observatory, LiteBIRD, and Euclid configurations may reduce the uncertainty on $\sum m_\nu$ by $\approx 9\%$, while the precision on the quintessential parameter $\alpha_{QI}$ is improved by $\approx 72\%$. These results highlight the importance of consistently accounting for neutrino mass when assessing the viability of extensions to the standard cosmological model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Census Before Rubin of Asteroid Families in the Main Belt</a><span class="id">[2602.20382]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A collisional family is a collection of &gt;km-size asteroid fragments produced by a large scale collision between asteroids. Here we cataloged 335 notable collisional families in the main asteroid belt. When possible, we estimated each family's formation age, mean visible albedo, taxonomic type, and parent body size. We found that older families (t_age&gt;10 Myr) produced by impacts on small parent bodies (diameter D&lt;5 km) are rarely identified because small members of these families have drifted over time by the Yarkovsky effect and blended with the background. The young families (t_age&lt;10 Myr) typically have small parent bodies (D&lt;10 km) as large asteroids do not disrupt often enough.

Our study focuses on 417 members of NYMGs aged 10-150 Myr. Using detrended light curves from the TESS Science Office Quick-Look Pipeline, coupled with our own additional detrending scheme for fast rotators, we systematically detect and characterize 6,288 stellar flares from 27,416 flare candidates. We analyzed light curves from Cycles 1-4 of the TESS mission, finding that for each NYMG member analyzed, at least one stellar flare was present. Flare candidates are initially detected using the AltaiPony flare package, followed by a recovery flare amplitudes, durations, and local continuum background levels. We examine the relationship between flare energy, age, and mass, finding a reduced flaring rate for late-type stars with age for high energy flares, as well as 5.5 times more flares detected in the 10-minute cadence TESS data compared to 30-minute cadence data. Additionally, flare events with extreme energies (E &gt;= 10^{34} erg) on M-dwarf and solar-type stars, providing implications for further exploration into exoplanet habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IR-Safe and IR-Resummed Bispectra Before and After Reconstruction in Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory</a><span class="id">[2602.20431]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a unified analytic framework for modeling the real-space dark matter bispectrum, including both auto and cross bispectra constructed from pre- and post-reconstruction density fields, based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). ULPT reorganizes the standard Lagrangian approach by separating the Jacobian deviation, which generates the nonlinear source bispectrum, from the displacement-mapping effect that determines how long-wavelength bulk flows distort observed configurations. Within this structure, we derive general one-loop ULPT expressions for the bispectrum and analyze their infrared (IR) behavior, demonstrating exact, nonperturbative IR cancellation and the natural emergence of an IR-resummed description of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) damping. In particular, ULPT enables a detailed and fully analytic treatment of the wiggle-wiggle contribution to the IR-resummed bispectrum, whose structure has remained comparatively unexplored in previous approaches. We further construct IR-resummed models for the cross bispectra of all pre- and post-reconstruction combinations. For configurations in which the displacement fields differ, ULPT captures not only the overall exponential damping but also the more intricate BAO-scale modulation characteristic of mixed pre/post bispectra. Our results clarify the physical origin of nonlinear BAO suppression and provide a compact theoretical framework in which the full ULPT bispectrum, once implemented numerically through displacement-mapping convolution integrals, will automatically encode all nonlinear BAO and IR effects. The framework developed here therefore offers a unified and IR-safe foundation for interpreting next-generation bispectrum measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of Spatial Complexity in Flare Ribbon Substructure and Its Relationship to Magnetic Reconnection Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2602.20470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent three-dimensional flare models suggest that flare-ribbon substructure is linked to the fragmentation of the reconnecting current sheet in the corona. Flare-ribbon substructure can therefore potentially serve as a unique diagnostic tool for physical processes in the flare current sheet. In this paper, we describe a new method to quantify the evolution of ribbon substructure, which first extract the ribbon's leading bright front and the quantifies its morphology using the box-counting dimension and Correlation Dimension Mapping (CDM). We first test our method using synthetic observations. We then find that when the flare ribbon boundary has more multi-spatial-scale features (higher box-counting dimension), hard X-ray (HXR) emission and magnetic reconnection rates are the strongest. We also find that the flare-ribbon complexity characterized by CDM has moderate correlation with the IRIS Si IV 1402.77 Å non-thermal velocity (in the negative-polarity ribbon) and reconnection flux rates (in ribbons of both magnetic polarities). We conclude that the build-up of the spatial complexity of the ribbons at multiple spatial scales can serve as an observational proxy for current-sheet fragmentation in the corona.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introduction to Strong Alfvénic MHD Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2602.20472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many astrophysical fluids are magnetized and turbulent. Such fluids can be often described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In this review, we mainly consider MHD turbulence with a strong mean magnetic field whose energy density is greater than or equal to the local kinetic energy density. In these fluids, the MHD waves, especially Alfvén waves, play a dominant dynamical role. Alfvén waves travel along magnetic field lines and collisions of opposite-traveling Alfvén wave packets are essential for turbulence cascade. We focus on strong turbulence regime, where nonlinear interaction during the collision is sufficiently strong and thus one collision is enough to complete turbulence cascade. We will cover the following types of turbulence. First, we review strong Alfvénic MHD turbulence. If the mean magnetic field is very strong, wave packets move very fast and duration of collision is too short to complete turbulence cascade. Even in this case we will show that strong turbulence regime emerges on a small scale. Second, we will consider small-scale MHD turbulence, where interaction of small-scale variants of Alfvén waves (i.e., whistler waves) is important. Third, we review scaling relations in strong relativistic force-free MHD turbulence, where interaction of relativistic Alfvén waves is important. Finally, we briefly discuss scaling relations in compressible MHD turbulence, where interaction of Alfvén waves is still important.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for Light-Mass Fractionally Charged Particles in Space with DAMPE Experiment</a><span class="id">[2602.20519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Free Fractionally Charged Particles (FCPs) are predicted by some theories beyond or extended to the standard model. FCPs have been widely searched for by underground and space-based experiments based on the assumption of heavy lepton-like particles. However, there is a paucity of research focusing on light-mass FCPs (LFCPs) in the sub-MeV mass range. In this work, we report the LFCPs in primary high energy cosmic rays, based on observational data from the Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) satellite. This study utilized ten years on-orbit data of DAMPE to search for LFCPs with a charge of $\frac{2}{3}~e$. No LFCP candidate was observed. Upper flux limit of LFCPs with a mass of 0.511 MeV$/c^{2}$ and a charge of $\frac{2}{3}~e$ is determined to be $\rm 5.0 \times 10^{-11}\,cm^{-2}sr^{-1}s^{-1}$ at the $\rm 90\%$ confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASKAP J005512.2-255834: A Luminous, Long-Lived Radio Transient at z = 0.1 – an Orphan Afterglow or an off-nuclear TDE from an IMBH?</a><span class="id">[2602.20522]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a slowly evolving, extragalactic radio transient, ASKAP J005512.2–255834 (hereafter ASKAP J0055-2558), identified using the Australian SKA Pathfinder in a search for orphan afterglows associated with archival gravitational wave events. Although discovered in this context, there is no evidence that the transient is associated with any known gravitational wave event. Nonetheless, this source exhibits a 20-fold increase in flux density over $&lt;250$ days, and it remains in a declining, detectable state more than 1000 days after the initial detection. Follow-up observations from 0.3 to 9 GHz reveal an evolving spectrum consistent with synchrotron emission. ASKAP J0055-2558 is spatially coincident with a low-mass, star-forming galaxy at redshift $z = 0.116$ ($d_{\rm L}$= 543 Mpc), placing its peak radio luminosity at $\nu L_\nu \sim 10^{39}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. Analysis of its radio light curve, inferred blastwave velocity, energetics, host galaxy properties and the absence of counterparts at other wavelengths suggest that ASKAP J0055-2558 is most consistent with either the late-time phase of an orphan long gamma-ray burst afterglow or a tidal disruption event involving an intermediate-mass black hole spatially offset from the galaxy nucleus. The radio discovery of either of these phenomena is extremely rare, with only a few or no confirmed examples to date.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT 2024wpp: the most luminous fast-evolving optical transient linked to the merger explosion of a black-hole binary</a><span class="id">[2602.20523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represent one of the most exotic astrophysical transients, exhibiting unusually strong emission across X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths.

Detailed modeling of luminsoity evolution favors a coalesce explosion of a 34 M$_{\odot}$ Wolf-Rayet star with a 15 M$_{\odot}$ black hole (BH), demonstrating that some FBOTs may be associated with TDE of a stellar blackhole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capture and Stability of Resonant Planet Pairs in Turbulent Disk</a><span class="id">[2602.20525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a theoretical framework for the resonance capture and stability of two-planet systems in turbulent disks. By incorporating stochastic forcing (parameterized by $\kappa$) alongside laminar angular momentum and eccentricity damping timescales ($\tau_{\rm m}, \tau_{e}$), we derive an analytical criterion for the general $j:j-1$ mean motion resonances, and validate it through N-body simulations. The outcome is mapped in $\kappa$-$\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$ parameter space, revealing two distinct regimes: resonance trapping and turbulence-induced disruption – which occurs either directly cross or via temporary capture followed by escape through turbulent diffusion. Crucially, our analysis identifies turbulence as a universal destabilizer. It amplifies the intrinsic overstability mechanism: In laminar disks, escape requires $\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$ to drop below a critical limit due to excessive eccentricity excitation. We demonstrate that turbulent diffusion lowers this limit, demanding stronger damping (larger $\tau_{\rm m}/\tau_{e}$) for stability. Thus, greater turbulence promotes escape, and sufficiently strong diffusion precludes resonance retention irrespective of eccentricity damping.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotation of a Solar Jet Driven by Plasma Flow along Helical Magnetic Fields in an Active Region</a><span class="id">[2602.20542]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar jets, collimated plasma ejections driven by magnetic reconnection, play a vital role in energy transport and coronal heating. While rotational motions in jets are often attributed to magnetic field untwisting, alternative explanatory mechanisms remain possible. This study investigates a rotating jet in an active region observed on 2023 August 1 using multi-wavelength observations from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), Chinese Ha Solar Explorer (CHASE), and Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), combined with a self-consistent time-dependent magnetofrictional (TMF) model and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. Spectral diagnostics reveal coexisting red and blue shifts along the edges and central axis of the jet, indicating helical plasma motion within a twisted magnetic structure. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the jet's rotation arises from plasma propagating along helical open field lines, formed via reconnection between a pre-existing flux rope and overlying magnetic fields. Contrary to classical untwisting models, both linear and rotational velocities decrease with altitude during the jet propagation. These results highlight that the observed rotation results from plasma spiral motion along twisted fields rather than untwisting dynamics of the magnetic field itself, providing new insights into solar jet energetics and their connection to broader solar phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20587" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the onset height of coronal mass ejection driven shocks using near-Sun observations in visible and radio wavelengths</a><span class="id">[2602.20587]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the debated issues about the onset of the type II radio bursts near the Sun is the heliocentric distance ($r$) at which the associated magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) shocks are formed, and the association of the latter with the coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

We confirmed the planetary nature of these objects with ground-based spectroscopic follow-up observations using FEROS and the new PLATOSpec spectrograph attached to the ESO 1.52 m telescope at the La Silla Observatory, and with ground-based photometric observations of the Observatoire Moana, Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope and ASTEP. From a global fit to the photometry and radial velocities, we determine that the planet TIC 147027702b has a low-eccentric orbit ($e = 0.13 \pm 0.05$) with a period of 44.4 days and has a mass of $1.09^{+0.07}_{-0.13}$ M$_J$ and a radius of $0.98 \pm 0.06$ R$_J$. TIC 245076932b has a moderately low mass of $0.51 \pm 0.05$ M$_J$, a radius of $0.97 \pm 0.05$ R$_J$, and an eccentric orbit ($e = 0.43 \pm 0.02$) with a period of 21.6 days. TIC 87422071b has a mass of $1.29 \pm 0.10$ M$_J$, a radius of $0.97 \pm 0.08$ R$_J$, and has a slightly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.12 \pm 0.07$) with a period of 11.3 days. These well-characterised warm Jupiters expand the currently limited sample of similar gas giants and provide valuable benchmarks for testing models of giant-planet formation, migration, and tidal evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infall onto the Protoplanetary Disk during the Gravitational Collapse of a Molecular Cloud</a><span class="id">[2602.20688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The development of models for matter infall from a collapsing molecular cloud is an essential part of numerical studies on the formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. In this article, the widely used Nakamoto and Nakagawa (1994) model is analyzed and modifications are proposed to complement the initial model. These improvements include calculation for the outer boundary of a molecular cloud and refinement of the initial density distribution within. Also, due to the finite size of a cloud, the approach for computing the rate of mass infall onto the protoplanetary disk during collapse is modified. The proposed enhancements are aimed at eliminating the key limitations of the initial model, but do not affect its advantages, such as simplicity in numerical implementation. Using the modified model, we investigate the duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects and compare the modeling results with observational data. The results indicate a shorter duration of the embedded phase of the evolution of young stellar objects, especially in star-forming regions with a high amplitude of the initial density perturbation of prestellar condensation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bypassing the Lyth Bound with Entangled Gravitons: Primordial Signatures and Late-Time Noise</a><span class="id">[2602.20734]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that quantum entanglement between primordial gravitons in dynamically decoupled gravitational sectors can parametrically enhance the tensor power spectrum during inflation.

The resulting mixed state leaves a distinctive &quot;quantum birthmark&quot; in the form of oscillatory features in the power spectrum and a characteristic violation of the single-field consistency relation, manifesting as a scale-dependent enhancement of the squeezed-limit bispectrum.

III. Polarimetry</a><span class="id">[2602.20761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Be/X-ray binaries are the most numerous group of high-mass X-ray binaries. Their long-term optical and infrared variability reflects the evolution of the circumstellar disk around the luminous companion. This variability manifests photometrically as an excess of flux that increases with wavelength and spectroscopically as line emission. The disk is also expected to generate linear polarization. We present a systematic study of the optical long-term polarimetric variability of Be/X-ray binaries on data collected over 10 years. Our aim is to characterize the polarimetric properties of these systems and to probe the structure of their circumstellar disks. We have been monitoring Be/X-ray binaries visible from the Northern hemisphere with the RoboPol polarimeter. Optical polarimetric variability is a common trait in Be/X-ray binaries. The variability can be attributed to the Be star's circumstellar disk. Our polarization analysis confirms previous claims based on spectroscopic data that the circumstellar disks in BeXBs are, on average, smaller and denser than those in Be stars in non-binary systems. Our data also confirms the presence of highly distorted disks before giant X-ray outbursts, although this result is still affected by the lack of simultaneous and well-sampled observations during major X-ray outbursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cylindrical cosmological simulations with StePS</a><span class="id">[2602.20787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The global topology of the Universe can affect the long-range gravitational forces through the boundary conditions. To study non-trivial topologies in detail, simulations that natively adopt such geometries are required. Cosmological $N$-body simulations typically evolve matter in a periodic cubic box. While numerically convenient, this imposes a non-trivial 3-torus topology that affects long-range gravitational forces, potentially biasing large-scale statistics. We introduce a compactified simulation framework that is only periodic along a single axis, while having infinite topology with isotropic boundary conditions towards the perpendicular directions, i.e. an $\mathrm{S}^1\times\mathbb{R}^2$ (&quot;slab&quot;) topology. This new simulation geometry is ideal for simulating systems with cylindrical symmetries like filaments or certain anisotropic cosmological models. We compactify comoving space via inverse stereographic projection along the radial direction of a periodic cylinder, and evolve particles with Newtonian dynamics. A smoothly varying spatial and mass resolution with radius suppresses edge artefacts at the free outer boundary. Our implementation in the StePS (STEreographically Projected cosmological Simulations) framework uses a direct $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ force calculation that maps efficiently to GPUs, and Octree $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ force calculation that can be used on large CPU-clusters. The cylindrical domain's topology enables fully self-consistent simulations in the $\mathrm{S}^1\times\mathbb{R}^2$ manifold and mitigates periodic-image artefacts for targets whose symmetries are mismatched to a cubic box. The main trade-off is radially varying resolution with distinct systematics and analysis requirements. We demonstrate the accuracy of the new simulation method in a standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photosynthetic exergy I.

We develop a radiative-thermodynamic framework that quantifies the maximum useful work extractable for a given star-planet configuration and yields exergy-based bounds on photosynthetic power and long-wavelength absorption cutoffs. From these we derive kinetically constrained red limits for high-$\Delta G$ photochemistry and apply them to Earth-like planets receiving the same bolometric flux from FGK and M blackbody hosts, computing thresholded photon supplies and truncated exergy fluxes below a photosystem II red limit. For such planets the constraints confine single-photon oxygenic photosynthesis to near-infrared bands around Solar-type stars and to somewhat bluer wavelengths around late M dwarfs. Integrated over the stellar spectrum, the thresholded photon supply and truncated exergy available to drive a photosystem water-oxidation step are larger by factors $\sim 5$ around FGK hosts than around $T_\star\approx 3000$ K M dwarfs. For the Solar-Earth system, the exergy-based upper bound on O$_2$ production exceeds the observed O$_2$ throughput by several orders of magnitude, consistent with Earth's photosynthetic efficiencies. Cool M dwarfs suffer a double penalty: fewer photons above threshold and a lower shortwave exergy fraction, yielding systematically tighter ceilings on high-$\Delta G$ photosynthesis than around FGK stars. Our framework provides upper limits on photosynthetically harvestable power on habitable-zone planets and enables comparisons of photosynthetic potential across exoplanetary systems, and can be extended to multi-band photosystems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infrared spectropolarimetry of a C-class solar flare footpoint plasma – I.

We examine the coupling between the photosphere and the chromosphere, studying the polarimetric signals during a period that encompasses the decaying phase of a C-class flare and the appearance of a new C-class flare at the same location. We focus on the analysis of various spectral lines. In particular, we study the Si I 10827 Å, Ca I 10833.4 Å, Na I 10834.9 Å, and Ca I 10838.9 Å photospheric lines, as well as the He I 10830 Å triplet. GRIS data revealed the presence of flare-related red- and blueshifted spectral line components, reaching Doppler velocities up to 90 km/s, and complex Si I profiles where the He i spectral line contribution is blueshifted. In contrast, the photospheric Ca i and Na i transitions remained unchanged, indicating that the flare did not modify the physical conditions of the lower photosphere. We combined that information with simultaneous imaging in the Ca ii H line and TiO band with the improved High-resolution Fast Imager (HiFI+), finding that the flare emission did not affect the inverse granulation or nearby plage, in agreement with the results from GRIS. We also complement the previous studies with a forward modelling computation, concluding that the He I spectral line emission reflects a complex response of the flaring chromosphere. Radiative excitation from coronal EUV irradiation, energy deposition by flare-accelerated electrons, and dynamic field-aligned plasma flows likely act together to produce the observed supersonic downflows and upflows. We plan to expand these findings through inversions of the He I 10830 Å triplet signals in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characteristics of natural remanence records in fine-grained particles returned from asteroid Ryugu</a><span class="id">[2602.20806]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Particles collected from the asteroid Ryugu by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft offer a unique opportunity to investigate the magnetic record of the primitive solar system, as any terrestrial magnetic contamination is minimal and can be accounted for. In previous studies, stepwise alternating field demagnetization (AFD) measurements of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) records have been conducted on seven Ryugu particles. However, due to the limited number of samples, there is no consensus regarding the interpretation of the results of these measurements. To address this problem, we performed stepwise AFD measurements of the NRM on 28 Ryugu particles. Twenty-three of the particles exhibited one or two stable NRM components, whereas the remaining five did not. Isothermal remanent magnetization-based paleointensity values derived from stable NRM components varied by more than one order of magnitude. These NRM characteristics were consistent with those observed in previous studies. Therefore, as a reflection of the original nature of the NRM record, some Ryugu particles exhibited stable NRM components, whereas others did not. The Ryugu particles investigated in this study and those from a previous study exhibited spatially inhomogeneous NRM directions within individual particles, constraining the NRM acquisition time to before the final solidification of the current Ryugu particles. A mechanism of remanence acquisition that can explain the observed NRM characteristics is a chemical remanent magnetization associated with the growth of framboidal magnetite during aqueous alteration in Ryugu's parent body.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar Discoveries from the TRAPUM UHF Survey of Fermi-LAT Sources</a><span class="id">[2602.20811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) provides advantages for radio pulsar searches by enabling efficient target selection. We can confidently point radio telescopes to the positions of Fermi unidentified gamma-ray sources that have a high probability of hosting a pulsar. As part of Transients and Pulsars with MeerKAT (TRAPUM), we conducted a survey of Fermi-LAT sources using the Ultra High Frequency (UHF; 544-1088 MHz) receiver of the MeerKAT radio telescope. We observed 79 sources that were identified as pulsar-like candidates using a random forest technique from the Fermi-LAT Fourth Source Catalogue. We observed each target for 10 minutes at two separate epochs. As a result, we discovered nine new millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and six slow pulsars. Based on the radio discoveries, we also searched for gamma-ray pulsations, confirming that seven of the newly discovered MSPs are associated with Fermi-LAT sources, and performed joint radio and gamma-ray pulsar timing. Companion mass estimates and evidence of radio eclipses indicate that among the nine MSPs there are three black widows and three redbacks. Lastly, we compared the discovered pulsars in the MeerKAT UHF survey against the previous Fermi sources TRAPUM survey at L band, concluding the superiority of UHF observations in sensitivity to fainter pulsars and in detection rate than L band for finding new gamma-ray MSPs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar structure, magnetism and the variational principle</a><span class="id">[2602.20879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Matter interacts through two long range forces: gravity and electromagnetism. While all matter contributes to the gravitational potential, electromagnetic effects were traditionally expected to cancel in large systems because positive and negative charges balance. Yet astrophysical objects clearly show long range electromagnetic behavior, so the cancellation cannot be perfect. This paper develops a model for stationary aggregation of matter into a star that consistently includes angular momentum and electromagnetic effects. We reformulate the standard polytropic stellar model as a variational problem and extend it to include the kinetic energy of rigid rotation and the electromagnetic interaction energy between oppositely charged baryonic matter. The electromagnetic contribution to the action is taken to be the minimal energy required to generate the stellar magnetic dipole moment. This energy has two parts: the pure electromagnetic contribution, expressible as a surface integral, and the free energy difference between magnetized and unmagnetized matter, obtained by analyzing a degenerate electron gas in a background of cold ions. Differential forms provide a convenient mathematical framework. The resulting model incorporates electromagnetic effects into stellar structure in a way consistent with linearized general relativity. Although the full system forms a complex open boundary problem, exact solutions exist under simplifying assumptions. The phase diagram predicted by the simplified model shows patterns that may motivate further study of the balance between matter, gravitation, and electromagnetism</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20882" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Geminga halo at GeV energies with Fermi-LAT data</a><span class="id">[2602.20882]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nearby pulsars within $\sim1\,{\rm kpc}$ are considered to be possible sources of 10-500 GeV cosmic-ray positron excess measured by PAMELA and AMS-02. A TeV halo around Geminga is detected by HAWC, and the measurements of its surface brightness profile indicate a slow particle diffusion surrounding the source. This result challenges the pulsar interpretation of the positron excess. The observations at GeV energies provide direct information on the electron/positron density in the GeV nebula, which can offer more direct constraints on the origin of the positron excess. Two previous works have performed analyses on the GeV emission of the pulsar halo, but focused on the energy band above 8 GeV. In this work, we use a longer dataset from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to re-analyze the GeV halo emission of Geminga, extending the analysis to cover the energy range of 1-1000 GeV. We find that the analysis in this wider energy range results in a low significance of the halo emission. This can be attributed to the Galactic interstellar emission model being unable to perfectly fit the background over this broader energy range, and due to the low measured halo flux at $&lt;$ 10 GeV energies leading to a mismatch between the observation and model expectation. We also derive the spectral energy distribution of the tentative halo emission, which shows a very hard spectrum in the 1-10 GeV range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Magnetic Filling in MAD Simulations and its Impact on the Jet in M87</a><span class="id">[2602.20893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetically arrested accretion disks (MADs) in black hole jet launching simulations are very successful in modelling low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) like M87*. The Fishbone-Moncrief torus is well established for this purpose in numerical astrophysics. The extent of the magnetic vector potential inside the torus that we coin the filling factor has not been studied before in the case of MAD simulations. We employ five 3D general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations initialized with large-scale tori, that are immersed in weak, poloidal magnetic fields. To study the impact of the spatial extent of the initial magnetic field, hence the magnetic energy content in the torus, we scale it with the filling factor w.r.t. the poloidal geometric area of the mass density distribution. A common choice of the filling factor is complimented and investigated in terms of altered energetics and angular momentum transport. Further, we investigate the polarized, radiative imprints of synchrotron emission on M87 at 86 GHz, comparing them with VLBI observations. Our simulations show that elevated filling factors significantly increase the electromagnetic energy contributions and outward angular momentum transport in the jet, due to the initially increased magnetic energy-content in the torus. High magnetic fillings exhibit increased linear polarization fractions, agreeing with the observed 15$\%$ in M87*. We find the jet morphology more prone to disk-vertical flux tubes generated by MAD events. We show, that GRMHD simulations bracket the jet width measurements at the jet base in M87*. Increased magnetic filling of the torus produces jets that are noticeably brighter downstream compared to our reference models, hence, we find high fillings well suited for extended GRMHD jet models of other low-luminosity AGN, as well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic Dissipative Magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation for 2-particle species gas</a><span class="id">[2602.20942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the equations of motion of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics from the Boltzmann equation using the method of moments.

Therefore, understanding the physical processes during a solar flare and predicting its radiation profiles are of great importance. In this study, we analyze and model an M1.4 two-ribbon long-duration flare, whose multiple extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) emission peaks are found to correspond to different three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconnections driven by the continuous evolution of a flux rope. In particular, the second and third peaks in the 335 Å EUV channel originate from longer and higher flare loops with extended cooling times, formed by reconnection between flux-rope field lines and ambient sheared-arcade field lines ($ar\text{--}rf$) and between flux-rope field lines themselves ($rr\text{--}rf$). These results are supported by the drifting of the flux-rope footpoint (and flare ribbon) and the decrease in toroidal flux of the flux rope, as well as by the connectivity transfer of representative field lines in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. This work points out, for the first time, new manifestations of the 3D flare scenario in EUV light curves. On the one hand, it provides an explanation for two-ribbon late-phase flares. On the other hand, the conclusions presented here help bridge the gap between imaging observations, EUV light-curve diagnostics, and the magnetic structures of the associated coronal mass ejections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulent AGN coronae as the origin of diffuse neutrinos up to PeV energies</a><span class="id">[2602.20969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has been shown that the turbulence acceleration in AGN coronae can account for 1-10 TeV neutrinos from some AGNs, such as the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. Based on this, there are attempts to explain the diffuse neutrinos observed by IceCube with the accumulated contribution from a population of AGNs, but it is found that the maximum neutrino energy is less than tens of TeV and, as a result, additional source classes are needed to explain the high-energy component above this energy. Recently, motivated by the detection of &gt;100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, it was shown that the turbulence acceleration in the corona can explain &gt;100 TeV neutrinos given a larger magnetization parameter ($\sigma\sim 1$) in the corona, which leads to a larger maximum proton energy and a hard proton spectrum. In this paper, we extend this assumption to the population of AGNs and study whether the population of AGNs with a wide range of magnetization can explain the entire diffuse neutrinos. We find that AGN coronae could account for the diffuse neutrinos up to PeV energies if a significant fraction of AGNs have magnetization as large as $\sigma\sim 1-10$. This conclusion is insensitive to the shape of the magnetization parameter distribution as long as the range of the magnetization parameter is sufficiently wide and the distribution is flat towards high magnetization. Interestingly, this model can also explain the peak of the diffuse neutrino spectrum at 30 TeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black hole-Neutron star distinction based on long-term MAXI and Swift study of 42 low mass X-ray binaries</a><span class="id">[2602.20988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we analysed about $\sim$13 years of publicly available data from MAXI and Swift/BAT to examine the long-term source evolution of 42 transient low-mass X-ray binaries. The sample consists of 11 confirmed black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs), 10 black hole candidates (BHC), and 21 neutron star X-ray binaries (NSXBs). Outbursts and flaring activities studied over 13 years show that 19/21 NSXBs spend significantly longer time in the hard state (observations for which hardness ratio is $\geq$ 0.2) while 15/21 BHXB+XRC spend substantially longer time in the soft state (observations for which hardness ratio is $&lt;$ 0.2). The frequency distribution of the hardness ratio clearly shows two distinct distributions for BHXBs and NSXBs, with their peaks separated: NSXBs prefer harder values, while BHXBs prefer softer values of hardness. Our model-independent analysis for 42 transient sources shows that statistically NSXBs do not prefer to show a canonical high soft state as observed in BHXBs. Additionally, the probability distribution of the duration of the 2-20 keV X-ray outburst is observed to peak at a significantly longer duration ($&gt;$100 days) for BHXBs than for NSXBs (15-60 days). Our analysis shows that among candidate sources, Swift J1728.9-3613, MAXI J1535-571, MAXI J1659-152, EXO 1846-031 show a `q' diagram in the HID and prefer to align with the HID frequency distribution of BHXBs that show `q' diagram, MAXI J1305-704 and MAXI J1836-194 align with frequency distribution of black hole sources without `q' diagram while MAXI J1848-015 shows the HID distribution similar to NSXBs, indicating a neutron star accretor. Therefore, a long-term statistical study of MAXI and Swift/BAT X-ray outbursts from a large sample of transient sources may be used to distinguish BHXB from NSXB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular bipolar outflow in SN 1987A supports the jittering-jets explosion mechanism</a><span class="id">[2602.21004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I examine high-quality CO and SiO molecular maps of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant SN 1987A from the literature and find that the molecular gas exhibits a bipolar structure, correlated with the visible bipolar morphology (termed the keyhole) and the bipolar morphology of the iron emission map.

It yields allowed regions in the system's parameter space which, as far as the hole's dimensionless spin parameter is concerned, are essentially in agreement with those obtained in the literature with general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The present analytical approach can be extended to include the precession due to the hole's quadrupole mass moment as well. It breaks the degeneracy in the allowed regions occurring for negative and positive values of the spin parameter when only the Lense-Thirring effect is considered. The best estimate for the hole's mass yields the range $0.185-0.215$ for the dimensionless spin parameter. Using the same strategy with the gravitomagnetic frequency for an extended disk of finite size with a parameterized power-law mass density yields to distinct, generally non-overlapping allowed regions for each value of the power-law index adopted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RAMSES-MCR: A consistent multi-group treatment of cosmic rays physics in momentum-space with the RAMSES code</a><span class="id">[2602.21147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic rays (CRs) are known to play a key role in many astrophysical environments: they can modify shock dynamics, influence the thermochemistry and the ionization of the interstellar medium, regulate galaxy mass content by driving galactic winds, and be released by jets from active galactic nuclei. They also serve as important observational tracers through $\gamma$-ray emission, radio synchrotron, and secondary particle production. Since CR particles follow power-law distributions in momentum space spanning many decades in energy, and because diffusion and radiative losses further shape these spectra, it is crucial to model spectrally resolved CRs in numerical simulations and to assess the impact of this modeling on gas dynamics and observational signatures. We present a consistent multi-group spectral method in momentum space for CR protons called RAMSES-MCR in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, based on the two-moment formalism that evolves both CR energy and number density in momentum space, together with their associated flux. The modeled CR processes include advection, anisotropic/isotropic diffusion, streaming instability, Coulomb and hadronic losses, adiabatic changes, and feedback onto the gas. We also show that the method can be naturally extended to CR electrons (e.g. including synchrotron losses) and generalized to multiple CR species. The implementation is validated against a suite of standard multi-dimensional tests. We finally apply RAMSES-MCR to the three-dimensional expansion of a supernova remnant including CRs with anisotropic diffusion and energy losses, and demonstrate how CR energy redistributes in a momentum-dependent manner and modifies the gas momentum during the snowplough phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting CPL with sign-switching density: to cross or not to cross the NECB</a><span class="id">[2602.21169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent DESI DR2 BAO measurements, when combined with CMB and SNeIa data, exhibit a $3.2\sigma$-$3.4\sigma$ preference for dynamical dark energy (DE) described by the CPL-parametrized equation of state. A particularly striking feature of these reconstructions is an apparent transition from an early-time phantom-like regime to a late-time quintessence-like behavior. For positive-definite DE densities, this transition is often phrased as a crossing of the phantom divide line (PDL) at $w(a)=-1$. Allowing the DE density to become negative, however, renders the PDL (in the sense of $w(a)=-1$) non-diagnostic as a global separator: the physically meaningful criterion is instead the null energy condition boundary (NECB), $\rho_{\rm DE}+p_{\rm DE}=0$. We therefore test whether the data-driven preference for NECB-crossing in CPL reconstructions persists once alternative realizations of phantom behavior are admitted, specifically through sign-switching DE densities. To this end, we introduce and constrain two controlled phenomenological extensions of the CPL framework featuring a negative DE phase in the past. In the CPL$\to-\Lambda$ model, the switching epoch is tied to the CPL-inferred NECB-crossing scale factor, yielding an early-time negative cosmological-constant phase, while the post-switch evolution follows the CPL branch. In the sCPL model, the CPL equation of state is maintained at all times, while the sign switch in the energy density occurs at an independent transition redshift. We find that late-time BAO and SNeIa data drive the negative-density phase beyond their effective redshift coverage, and that this requirement is the primary driver of the inferred parameter behavior. While both models are statistically disfavored relative to the baseline CPL, admitting a negative DE phase generally reduces the significance of deviations from a cosmological constant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical Predictions in Closed Quantum Gravity</a><span class="id">[2602.13387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent developments in gravitational path integrals indicate that the nonperturbative physical Hilbert space of a closed universe is one-dimensional within each superselection sector. This raises a basic puzzle: how can a unique quantum-gravity state give rise to semiclassical physics, measurement outcomes, and classical probabilities? In this paper, we develop a framework in which nontrivial and statistically stable predictions emerge despite the one-dimensionality of the fully constrained Hilbert space. The key idea is to extract physical predictions in an enlarged, unconstrained Hilbert space by conditioning on observational data. We show that partial observability – reflecting the limited access of observers to the degrees of freedom of the universe – suppresses ensemble fluctuations associated with microscopic structure in the gravitational path integral, thereby restoring semiclassical predictability with exponential accuracy. We formulate the construction explicitly including contributions from the Hartle–Hawking no-boundary state, define a gauge-invariant Hilbert space for observations via a density operator, and generalize the formalism to conditioning on histories, clarifying the emergence of classical probabilities and an effective arrow of time. Finally, we explore whether this framework can support a realistic cosmology and identify assumptions that the underlying theory of quantum gravity must satisfy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking Leptogenesis and Asymmetric Dark Matter: A Testable Framework for Neutrino Mass and the Matter-Antimatter Asymmetry</a><span class="id">[2602.20237]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a minimal extension of the Leptogenesis framework that simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance through the decay of a heavy Majorana neutrino.

We explore two regimes: (i) wash-in, where an initial dark asymmetry is transferred to SM leptons by $2 \leftrightarrow 2$ scattering processes; and (ii) co-genesis, featuring a hierarchical coupling structure that allows enhanced CP violation while supporting a low-scale seesaw mechanism at order $\mathcal{O}(2)$ TeV. This setup not only links light neutrino masses to the Majorana mass term but also suggests that lepton-number violation may occur at experimentally accessible energy scales. In the co-genesis scenario, we show spin-independent cross sections for DM heavier than 10 GeV that can be tested in current direct detection experiments and motivate the exploration of cross sections inside the neutrino fog for lighter DM masses, establishing asymmetric leptogenesis as a predictive benchmark framework for direct-detection experiments and identifying a new hierarchical-coupling regime enabling TeV-scale leptogenesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warm dark matter from freeze-in at stronger coupling</a><span class="id">[2602.20242]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study warm Higgs portal dark matter (DM) in the framework of freeze-in at stronger coupling.

In this work, we first derive Kramers-like formulae for individual partial waves, demonstrating that existing calculations of bound-state formation severely violate unitarity. We then discuss how unitarity is restored through the resummation of the absorptive contributions to the incoming-state self-energy, generated by bound-state formation processes, taking into account their analytic structure in the complex momentum plane.

The Bogoliubov coefficients relating the in and out vacua are computed non-perturbatively using high-precision numerical methods, without relying on weak-field, small-amplitude or small-velocity expansions.

The real part of the potential controls the cosmological background and realizes a plateau-type inflation compatible with $\alpha$-attractor $\mathrm{T}$-models, while the imaginary part acts as an effective non-Hermitian deformation encoding dissipative effects. Working in the Jordan frame and imposing ghost-free conditions on the effective Planck mass, we derive the background equations and define a complex equation-of-state parameter whose real part governs the expansion and whose imaginary part quantifies departures from conservative dynamics. Numerical integration shows that the duration of inflation is primarily controlled by the nonminimal coupling $\zeta$, whereas the complex asymmetry parameter $\Delta\varepsilon$ has a negligible impact on the real background: the real energy density and pressure vary by less than $10^{-5}$ as $\Delta\varepsilon$ is scanned over its allowed range. Mapping the two-field dynamics to an effective single-field description in the Einstein frame, we obtain a spectral index $n_s\simeq 0.968-0.971$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r&lt;10^{-3}$, fully consistent with Planck 2018 bounds. We introduce a relevance parameter and show that non-Hermitian effects remain strongly suppressed during slow roll but grow to $\mathcal{O}(1)$ near the end of inflation, triggering an efficient reheating phase without additional fields or {\it ad hoc} friction terms. In this sense, the imaginary sector behaves as an effective $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric channel for energy transfer, providing a geometrical mechanism for inflation and its exit within a non-Hermitian scalar-tensor framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermodynamic Gravity with Non-Extensive Horizon Entropy and Topological Calibration</a><span class="id">[2602.20430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of gravitational dynamics in the presence of generalized, non-extensive horizon entropies. Working within a local Rindler-wedge framework, we formulate the Clausius relation as the stationarity condition of a Massieu functional at fixed Unruh temperature, which identifies the entropy slope as the parameter controlling the effective gravitational coupling. For area-type entropies with constant slope, the construction reproduces Einstein's equations with $G_{eff} = 1/(4s_0)$, while curvature-dependent entropy densities supplemented by an internal entropy-production term yield the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity. Motivated by group-entropic considerations and long-range correlations, we model the entropy of horizon cross sections by a power law $S(A) = \eta (A/4G)^\delta$ and analyze its local and global implications. To fix the otherwise arbitrary coarse-graining scale entering the entropy slope, we introduce a Topological Calibration Principle that ties the reference area to intrinsic geometric data through the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For compact two-dimensional sections, this selects a canonical calibration area and leads to a topology-dependent effective coupling $G_{eff}(\chi) \propto |\chi|^{1-\delta}$ where $\chi$ represents the Euler characteristic. Consistency across scales and topologies yields logarithmic bounds on $|1-\delta|$, while the associated scale dependence induces a characteristic modulation of the gravitational coupling in cosmology. The framework thus provides a controlled route to confront non-extensive horizon thermodynamics with both theoretical consistency requirements and observational constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accurate transition and hyperfine data in Ag I from Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and Relativistic Coupled-Cluster methods</a><span class="id">[2602.20711]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Silver is a key tracer of the weak r-process in late-type stars.

The Multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) methods were used in the present work. The quantitative and qualitative evaluation (QQE) approach is applied to the MCDHF transition rates to estimate the uncertainty according to the National Institute of Science and Technology Atomic Spectroscopic Data (NIST ASD) terminology. Excitation energies, transition data and hyperfine structure constants were calculated for $18$ states up to $4d^{10}8s$. $57$ electric dipole (E1) transition rates and weighted oscillator strengths are computed and estimated to be in the following NIST ASD uncertainty classes; $4$ in AA, $12$ in A+, $5$ in A, $13$ in B+, $6$ in B, $4$ in C+ with AA $\leq 1\%$, A+ $\leq 2\%$, A $\leq 3\%$, B+ $\leq 7\%$, B $\leq 10\%$, C+ $\leq 18\%$. The remaining transitions, mainly weak transitions involving the $4d^95s^2$ states, are estimated to be in the E class $&gt;50\%$. The computed lifetimes from both the MCDHF and RCC methods are in good mutual agreement and mostly fall within the error bars of available experimental values from laser induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements. The $4d^95s^2~^2D_{5/2}$ metastable state, important for establishing the ionization balance, decay through an E2 transition to the ground state. The calculated lifetime is $163\,\mathrm{ms}$.

The spectral properties of the band-averaged beam depend on the natural variation of the beam within the band, referred to as beam chromaticity. In this paper, we quantify the impact of the interplay of beam chromaticity and intrinsic frequency scaling from the various components that dominate the polarized sky emission on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, and foreground parameters. We do so by employing a parametric power-spectrum-based foreground component separation algorithm, namely BBPower, to which we provide beam-convolved time domain simulations performed with the beamconv software while assuming an idealized version of the SO SAT optics. We find a small, $0.02\sigma$, bias on $r$, due to beam chromaticity, which seems to mostly impact the dust spatial parameters, causing a maximum $0.77 \sigma$ bias on the dust $B$-mode spectra amplitude, $A_{d}$, when employing Gaussian foreground simulations. However, we find all parameter biases to be smaller than $1\sigma$ at all times, independently of the foreground model.

When analyzing these data with extended cosmologies this inconsistency manifests as a $\simeq3\sigma$ preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass or evolving dark energy. It is known that the preference for sub-minimal neutrino mass from the suppression of structure growth could be alleviated by increasing the optical depth to reionization $\tau$. We show that, because the CMB-inferred $\tau$ is negatively correlated with the matter fraction, a larger optical depth resolves a similar preference from geometric constraints. Optical depths large enough to resolve the neutrino mass tension ($\tau\sim0.09)$ reduce the preference for evolving dark energy from $\simeq3\sigma$ to $\simeq1.5\sigma$ and increase the CMB-inferred values of $n_s$ and $H_0$ to $0.968\pm0.004$ and $67.94\pm0.44$ km/s/Mpc, respectively. Conversely, within $\Lambda$CDM the combination of DESI BAO, high-$\ell$ CMB and CMB lensing yields $\tau = 0.090 \pm 0.012$, which is in $\simeq3-5\sigma$ tension with Planck low-$\ell$ polarization data when taken at face value. Essentially all current CMB analyses $-$ including recent results from WMAP+ACT and SPT $-$ adopt the Planck measurement of $\tau$: thus a systematic in large-scale Planck polarization would serve as a &quot;single-point failure&quot; for most modern cosmological analyses that include CMB data. While there is no evidence for systematics in the large-scale Planck data, $\tau$ remains the least well-constrained $\Lambda$CDM parameter and is far from its cosmic variance limit.

These simulations, performed for shock Lorentz factors $\Gamma_u = 2$, $3.5$, $6$, $10$, and $15$, are applicable to RRMS breakouts in shallowly declining density profiles such as stellar winds. We find that vigorous pair production acts as a thermostat, regulating the downstream temperature to $\sim 100$-$200~{\rm keV}$, largely independent of $f_{\rm esc}$. A subshock forms and strengthens with increasing $f_{\rm esc}$. The escaping spectra peak at $E_p \approx 300$-$600~{\rm keV}$ in the shock frame and deviate from a Wien distribution, exhibiting low-energy flattening ($f_\nu \propto \nu^{0}$) due to free-free emission and high-energy extensions caused by inverse Compton scattering from subshock-heated pairs. While an earlier analytical model reproduces the velocity structure well at $\Gamma_u = 2$, it significantly overestimates the shock width at higher Lorentz factors, particularly for $f_{\rm esc} \gtrsim$ a few $\%$. Based on this finding, we provide updated predictions for breakout observables in wind environments for $\Gamma_u \gtrsim 6$. Notably, the duration of the relativistic breakout becomes largely insensitive to the explosion energy and ejecta mass, typically exceeding analytical predictions by orders of magnitude and capable of producing a $\sim$300 s flash of MeV photons with a radiated energy of $\sim 10^{50}$ erg for an energetic explosion yielding $\Gamma_{bo} \sim 6$.

Our key findings show that in the deep sub-horizon limit, the perturbative behaviour remains valid, whereas in the super-horizon regime, non-linear dynamics exhibit a much richer phenomenology. Finally, we discuss the possibility of primordial black hole formation from the collapse of such perturbations and assess whether this process could serve as a viable mechanism to reheat the universe in the post-inflationary era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preferential Positron Acceleration in Relativistic Magnetized Electron-Positron-Ion Shocks</a><span class="id">[2508.06120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic shocks are considered efficient accelerators of charged particles and play crucial roles in high-energy astrophysical phenomena, such as gamma-ray bursts and pulsar winds.

Employing one-dimensional ab initio particle-in-cell simulations, we found a preferential positron acceleration through an interaction with the wakefield associated with a precursor wave in the upstream region. Test particle simulations revealed that the selective acceleration occurs for sufficiently large amplitudes of the wakefield. The mechanism can be understood as the relativistic $\boldsymbol{E}\times\boldsymbol{B}$ acceleration formulated in the upstream frame. A theoretical analysis of the positron acceleration in astrophysical contexts is presented, supporting ultra-relativistic shocks in pulsar winds as a primary source for the high-energy positron excess.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07367" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magma ocean interactions can explain JWST observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d</a><span class="id">[2510.07367]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sub-Neptunes with substantial atmospheres may possess magma oceans in contact with the overlying gas, with chemical interactions between the atmosphere and magma playing an important role in shaping atmospheric composition. Early JWST observations have found high abundances of carbon- and oxygen-bearing molecules in a number of sub-Neptune atmospheres, which may result from processes including accretion of icy material at formation or magma-atmosphere interactions. Previous work examining the effects of magma-atmosphere interactions on sub-Neptunes has mostly been limited to studying conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary, without considering implications for the upper atmosphere which is probed by spectroscopic observations. In this work, we present a modeling architecture to determine observable signatures of magma-atmosphere interactions. We combine an equilibrium chemistry code which models reactions between the core, mantle and atmosphere with a radiative-convective model that determines the composition and structure of the observable upper atmosphere. We examine how different conditions at the atmosphere-mantle boundary and different core and mantle compositions impact the upper atmospheric composition. We compare our models to JWST NIRISS+NIRSpec observations of the sub-Neptune TOI-270 d, finding that our models can provide a good fit to the observed transmission spectrum with little fine-tuning. This suggests that magma-atmosphere interactions may be sufficient to explain high abundances of molecules such as H$_2$O, CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ in sub-Neptune atmospheres, without additional accretion of icy material from the protoplanetary disk. Although other processes could lead to similar compositions, our work highlights the need to consider magma-atmosphere interactions when interpreting the observed atmospheric composition of a sub-Neptune.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Resolution Modelling of Coronae and Winds in Solar-type Stars with Varying Rotation Rates I.

However, the structures and properties of stellar coronae remain poorly understood. Using the Space Weather Modelling Framework with the Alfvén Wave Solar Model (SWMF-AWSoM) and dynamo-generated surface magnetic maps, here we model the coronae of four solar-type stars. By incorporating the Sun, our work covers a range of stars with the rotation varying from 1.0 to 23.3 $\Omega_\odot$ (periods of 25 to 1 days). Guided by observations, we scale the magnetic field strength with increasing rotation, covering a range between 6.0 G to 1200 G approximately. In our models, energy release associated with small-scale magnetic flux is a key source of coronal heating and is essential for reproducing realistic coronal structures. Our models capture dense (1$-$2 orders of magnitude higher than solar values) and ultra-hot ($\sim 10\,\mathrm{MK}$) coronae dominated by closed field structures. Using the CHIANTI atomic database, we also compute synthetic X-ray spectra and derive the corresponding X-ray luminosities $(L_X)$, which follow a scaling law to magnetic field $L_X \propto \langle|\mathbf{B}|\rangle^{1.75}$. Furthermore, the coronal X-ray emission is found to be rotationally modulated by the alternating presence of bright active regions and dark coronal holes. These results provide new insights into the extremely high-energy coronae of rapidly rotating solar-type stars, which differ markedly from the Sun.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clumpy Outflows from Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes I: Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations and Observational Implications</a><span class="id">[2510.17696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent advances in X-ray spectroscopic observation have enabled researchers to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows. In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles, exhibiting typical properties such as a size of  10 rg (where rg is the gravitational radius), a velocity of  0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of 10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are considered to originate from the region within &lt; 300 rg.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18706" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binding energy of compact stars and their non-radial oscillations</a><span class="id">[2510.18706]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the past years, a significant effort has been made with the scope of determining correlations, involving compact star properties, that are independent of the nuclear equation of state. Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the star formation history of all-sky and part-sky 100pc white dwarf samples</a><span class="id">[2510.20624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thanks to Gaia and large-scale spectroscopic follow-up surveys (4MOST, DESI, WEAVE, SDSS-V), it is now possible to build representative and minimally biased samples of the local white dwarf population.

Representing only 1-3 percent of all core-collapse SNe and often found in low-metallicity environments, their large diversity suggests a wide range of progenitor and explosion properties. This study aims to improve the understanding of 1987A-like SNe by characterizing their explosion parameters, including kinetic energy, ejected mass, progenitor radius at explosion, and synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass. Additionally, it seeks to identify systematic trends in both the physical properties and the observed features of these peculiar events. A new Bayesian parameter estimation method, based on our $^{56}$Ni-dependent analytical model for hydrogen-rich SNe, is applied to derive explosion parameters from the light curves and expansion velocities of one of the largest and most comprehensive 1987A-like SN samples to date. These data are measured through a consistent analysis of observations available in the literature. The analysis reveals a heterogeneous population that nevertheless clusters into two main groups: (i) lower-energy explosions with modest $^{56}$Ni yields ($\sim$0.07 M$_\odot$), similar to SN 1987A, and (ii) more energetic events (up to $\sim$5 foe) with larger nickel production and, in some cases, unusually extended progenitors. We confirm a robust correlation between $^{56}$Ni mass, peak luminosity, and explosion energy, as well as between ejecta mass and recombination timescale. An anti-correlation between Ba II line strength and photospheric velocity indicates that stronger Ba II absorptions in 1987A-like SNe arise from more compact, slowly expanding ejecta. Our study underscores the need to extend analytical frameworks to include additional power sources, enabling scalable and accurate modeling of the growing number of peculiar transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar – I.

The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Oxygen Valve on Hydrogen Escape Since the Great Oxidation Event</a><span class="id">[2512.09844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $&gt;10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1% to 150% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities that reduce local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 17 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\sim10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights for Early Dark Energy with Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</a><span class="id">[2512.11163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), as one of the earliest processes in the universe accessible to direct observation, offers a powerful and independent probe of the cosmic expansion history.

In this work, we leverage these developments to place model-independent constraints on deviations from the Standard Model expansion history during BBN. Using the latest abundance data, we apply principal component analysis to identify the most constrained and physically meaningful modes of expansion history variation. This approach allows us to impose the most general constraints on early dark energy during the epoch of BBN. We further examine whether general modifications to the expansion rate could alleviate the long-standing lithium problem. Our results demonstrate that BBN, sharpened by modern data and statistical techniques, remains an indispensable probe of dark energy and new physics in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11568" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnitude of the dark ages 21-cm signal in the context of existing early and late time constraints on $Λ$CDM</a><span class="id">[2512.11568]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dark ages 21-cm signal is a promising probe of the currently unobserved infant universe between the formation of the Cosmic Microwave Background around $z \approx 1100$ and the first galaxies around $z\approx 30$.

We show with injections in the Kepler data that the introduced novelties improve pipeline's completeness at a fixed false alarm rate. We apply the pipeline to the stars with previously identified planet candidates and show that our pipeline successfully recovers the previously confirmed candidates, but flags a considerable portion of unconfirmed candidates as likely false alarms, especially in the long period, low signal-to-noise ratio regime.

These sources serve as ideal laboratories for studying particle acceleration and radiation mechanisms in relativistic jets. In this work, we systematically analyze the $\sim$16-year Fermi-LAT observational data for 25 extreme high-synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs (EHBLs). The results indicate that the majority of these sources display stable or low flux levels in the GeV band, with only 6 sources showing significant variability at a confidence level exceeding 5$\sigma$. The time-averaged spectra over the 16-year period for most EHBLs are well described by a hard power-law model, with photon indices predominantly clustered between 1.7 and 1.8. Using Fermi-LAT data in conjunction with multiwavelength observations compiled from the literature, we construct broadband SEDs for these EHBLs and fit them with a one-zone synchrotron + synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) model. We find that this simplified theoretical framework is sufficient for modeling the observed SEDs of most of these EHBLs, albeit requiring relatively higher electron energies compared to other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs, and at times under-representing the UV emission. Based on the SED fitting results, we investigate the physical properties of the emission regions in these EHBLs and compare them with those of other $\gamma$-ray emitting HBLs.

Using the binary population synthesis code COMPAS, we evolve $10^7$ binaries with physically motivated initial distributions of binary parameters. Our simulations reproduce the strong bimodality in the final orbital separations, including a pronounced deficit of systems around $100-500 \rm\,R_\odot$, arising from distinct evolutionary pathways: wide DWDs predominantly originate from stable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF), while close DWDs form through unstable RLOF leading to at least one common envelope (CE) phase. Moreover, we show that the core compositions of WDs provide a powerful tracer of evolutionary history: He-core WDs are strongly concentrated in close systems, whereas CO-core WDs span the full separation range and exhibit a small mass gap in wide binaries. We further identify a correlation between the donor mass transfer rate and the final orbital separation, highlighting the impact of non-conservative mass transfer on the resulting orbital configuration of DWD systems. These results underscore the links among evolutionary channels, chemical composition, and mass transfer rates; thereby provide a unique framework for interpreting Gaia DWD samples and forecasting the joint electromagnetic and GW population accessible to LISA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic structure of coronal dark halos</a><span class="id">[2602.18604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>At low coronal temperatures around or below 1 MK distinct areas in the surroundings of active regions (AR) show emission at a level significantly below the emission coming from the quiet Sun (QS). These areas are referred to as dark halos, dark canopies, or dark moats. To better understand the nature of dark halos we study the connection between the photospheric magnetic field and coronal emission at different temperatures. Combining Solar Orbiter data from the high-resolution Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) and Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) instruments allows us to identify these areas that are dark in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) in the immediate vicinity of an AR. We probe both the photospheric magnetic field as well as the coronal intensities as a function of distance to the AR NOAA 12893. The dark halo has an unsigned magnetic flux density similar to the QS, but shows a strong radial dependence with distance from the AR centre. It drops by 38 % from 6.1 G at the inner boundary to 3.8 G at the outer, shifting from above to below QS levels. Coronal emission $\leq$1 MK is $\sim$40 % below QS and shows no dependence on distance to the AR centre. In contrast, at $\geq$1.6 MK, emission exceeds QS levels, but declines outward toward QS values. A few hot loops extend from the AR periphery across the halo, while at lower temperatures no such loops appear and short loops dominate the corona. The reduced unsigned magnetic flux density in the outermost parts of the dark halo, below QS level, suggests that reduced coronal heating due to weak underlying magnetic flux heating could be partially responsible for the reduced emission around 1 MK. Closer to the AR, other mechanisms might lead to reduced heating. The different loops structures detected for hotter and cooler coronal temperatures likely play a crucial role in understanding coronal dark halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermodynamic Consistent Description of Compact Stars of Two Interacting Fluids: The Case of Neutron Stars with Higgs Portal Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2412.04585]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider a thermodynamically consistent approach for the computation of the masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities of compact stars consisting of two interacting fluids with separately conserved quantum numbers.

The patterns for the mass-radius curves and the tidal deformability depend on the dark matter particle mass and are different from former studies. Compared to ordinary neutron star properties, we obtain smaller masses and radii for dark matter particle masses similar to the nucleon mass and, hence, smaller tidal deformabilities as a result of the softening of the equation of state due to the presence of dark matter. For dark matter particle masses below the nucleon mass and sizable chemical potentials with respect to the dark matter particle mass, there will be a dark halo instead of dark core. Our investigation provides the basis for studying mergers of compact stars where the two fluids of neutron star matter and dark matter are coupled kinetically to each other and are described by one combined energy-momentum tensor of the two interacting fluids but are chemically different with two separately conserved number currents.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving the QCD Axion Domain Wall Problem with a Light Axion</a><span class="id">[2507.07075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose two novel solutions to the domain wall problem of the QCD axion by introducing a massless or light axion that also couples to gluons.

This scenario predicts the existence of such string bundles, which may survive until today and leave observable signatures, such as gravitational waves, cosmic birefringence, and CMB anisotropies. The simultaneous detection of the QCD axion and any of these cosmological signatures would serve as a smoking-gun signal. The second solution assumes a homogeneous initial condition for the new axion. If it is sufficiently light, its potential temporarily induces a bias in the QCD axion potential before the onset of oscillations, rendering the domain walls unstable. In both scenarios, the Peccei-Quinn mechanism remains effective, and the strong CP problem is not reintroduced.

The time evolution of the basis functions is designed with Gaussian processes that directly include the stability and phenomenology criteria during the generation. Here, we focus on models with weak gravity that suppress the growth of Large-Scale Structure at late times. To achieve this behaviour, we mainly focus on the design of a dynamical effective Planck mass for theories with a vanishing fifth force. We find a broad range of weak-gravity islands in Horndeski theory space. We also include additional features, like a vanishing modification to gravity at $z=0$, and extend the exploration to islands of gravity with a non-zero fifth force.
