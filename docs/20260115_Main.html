We argue that s-process enrichment in the non-degenerate companion provides a powerful diagnostic for identifying WDs that formed via mergers in hierarchical triple systems. For a massive WD, standard single-star evolution requires a massive (&gt; 4 Msun) progenitor, yet such progenitors produce negligible s-process yields. We define IK Peg-type systems as those exhibiting this mass-yield tension: barium-enhanced companions orbiting WDs too massive to have descended from efficient s-process producers. The well-known system IK Peg exemplifies this class. Applying this framework to published spectroscopic data reveals several additional candidates, and we estimate that a few dozen such systems should exist in the current Gaia sample. If these systems trace inner-binary mergers in primordial triples, they represent observable intermediate stages towards eventual Type Ia supernovae via the double-merger pathway, as predicted by recent population-synthesis models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08915" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Note on pulsar timing array correlation functions induced by peculiar velocities</a><span class="id">[2601.08915]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several papers have recently calculated the contribution to pulsar timing array overlap reduction functions (ORFs) induced by our peculiar velocity with respect to the rest frame of the stochastic gravitational-wave background.

Observations have begun probing disks in their earliest stages, and have favored the magnetically-regulated disk formation scenario. Disks are also expected to exhibit ellipsoidal morphologies in the early phases, an aspect that has been widely overlooked. We aim to describe the birth and evolution of the disk while accounting for the eccentric motions of fluid parcels. Using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we self-consistently model the collapse of isolated $1~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and $3~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ cores to form a central protostar surrounded by a disk. We account for dust dynamics, and employ gas tracer particles to follow the thermodynamical history of fluid parcels. We find that magnetic fields and turbulence drive highly anisotropic accretion onto the disk via dense streamers. This streamer-fed accretion, occurring from the vertical and radial directions, drives vigorous internal turbulence that facilitates efficient angular momentum transport and rapid radial spreading. Crucially, the anisotropic inflow delivers material with an angular momentum deficit that continuously generates and sustains significant disk eccentricity ($e\sim 0.1$). Our results reveal ubiquitous eccentric kinematics in Class 0 disks, with direct implications for disk evolution, planetesimal formation, and the interpretation of cosmochemical signatures in Solar System meteorites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of asteroid (469219) Kamo`oalewa: the main asteroid belt or the Giordano Bruno crater on the Moon?</a><span class="id">[2601.08923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asteroid Kamo`oalewa is the target of the Tianwen-2 sample-return mission by CNSA. Because of its orbit and its spectral properties, it was proposed that Kamo`oalewa originated from the Moon as impact ejecta, possibly from the Giordano Bruno crater. We aim at estimating the relative contribution of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originating from the general near-Earth asteroid (NEA) population which originated in the main asteroid belt, and compare it with the relative contribution of Giordano Bruno ejecta. We first estimate the average fraction of quasi-satellite orbits at any given time. By using recently developed NEA population models, we extract the expected number of Earth co-orbitals of the same size of Kamo`oalewa, and then get an estimate of the average number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects using the fraction computed before. Similarly, we obtain an estimate for the number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects that may originate as ejecta from the Giordano Bruno impact. We also performed survey simulations to estimate their efficiency in the detection of Kamo`oalewa-like objects. We found that the main belt accounts for 1.23 \pm 0.13 Kamo`oalewa-like objects on average. The expected number of Kamo`oalewa-like objects originated as Giordano Bruno ejecta is 0.042, which is more than order of magnitude smaller. We found a discovery efficiency of Earth quasi-satellites between 95% and 70% for absolute magnitude between 22 and 25 for the Pan-STARRS survey, and population models show that this is in agreement with the known population. The Vera Rubin Observatory should reach an efficiency of 92% down to absolute magnitude 25. These estimates show that population models of NEAs are capable to account for Kamo`oalewa-like objects, thus supporting the hypothesis that that Kamo'oalewa originated from the main belt. This will be further investigated by the in-situ exploration of the Tianwen-2 mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Expanding the High-z Supernova Frontier: &quot;Wide-Area&quot; JWST Discoveries from the First Two Years of COSMOS-Web</a><span class="id">[2601.08931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Transient astronomy in the early Universe (z &gt; 2) remains largely unexplored, lying beyond the rest-frame optical spectroscopic reach of most current observatories. Yet this regime promises transformative insights, with high-redshift transients providing direct access to the early Universe and enabling studies of how stellar populations and cosmology evolve over cosmic time. JWST is uniquely equipped to probe these redshifts efficiently in the rest-frame optical and near-IR. We present results from an initial pathfinder search, covering an area of  133 arcmin^2 ( 0.037 deg^2) independently imaged by the PRIMER and COSMOS-Web (hereafter COSMOS) extragalactic surveys. Although neither program was designed for time-domain astronomy, combining their data results in difference images separated by roughly one year, leading to the discovery of 68 supernovae (SNe) with host photometric redshifts reaching z &lt; 5. For most SNe, only a single epoch is available, but the combination of host redshift, classification, color, and magnitude enables us to prioritize candidates for detailed photometric and spectroscopic follow-up. Among the most notable sources are a relatively bright, blue CCSN at z &gt; 3 (SN 2023aeab) and a young, normal SN Ia at z &gt; 2 (SN 2023aeax). The sample distribution highlights the increasing likelihood that a wide-area JWST program can uncover younger, bluer, and potentially more extreme explosions. While this pathfinder effort is limited in cadence and number of filters, it demonstrates the strong potential of a dedicated, well-planned time-domain survey with JWST to obtain the sample sizes and rate measurements needed to chart SN populations deep into the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A possible pathway to UHZ1-type systems at z 10 by heterogeneous mass primordial black holes as dark matter</a><span class="id">[2601.08936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent space-based observations discovered several unusual objects, exhibiting similar properties, at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$. Among them is the UHZ1 system at $z=10.1$, containing $\sim 10^8M_\odot$ in stars, with a similarly massive central black hole of $\sim 10^{7-8}M_\odot$. Here we propose a possible mechanism for forming such systems which hinges on the presence of primordial black holes (PBHs) covering a range of masses while contributing a significant fraction of the dark matter (DM). We evaluate the accurate expression for the small-scale power responsible for the collapse of the first halos in the presence of the PBH population. The extra power in the matter density field, produced by the granulation term, will cause an earlier collapse of DM halos, populated by PBHs of different masses. In these collapsed and virialized systems the PBHs will undergo 2-body relaxation, driving the more massive PBHs to the halo center under dynamical friction. We quantify this evolution for a distribution of PBH orbital parameters and halo properties. The analysis shows that PBHs can have appropriate mass functions capable of producing systems with parameters similar to what is observed for UHZ1. We suggest that the proposed mechanism could account for a subset of other systems newly discovered with the JWST at high redshifts, including the Little Red Dots.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can photoevaporation open gaps in protoplanetary discs?</a><span class="id">[2601.08938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether photoevaporation alone can open and sustain gaps in protoplanetary discs by coupling the evolving disc structure with the photoevaporative flow in two dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that once a density depression forms, the local mass-loss rate decreases sharply, suppressing further gap deepening. Viscous inflow and radial mass transport along the disc surface act to partially refill the depleted region, preventing complete clearing. The resulting configuration is a persistent, partially depleted zone whose evolution is largely insensitive to the initial disc morphology. This behaviour challenges the standard paradigm that photoevaporation efficiently carves clean inner cavities and directly produces transition discs. However, the pressure maximum at the outer edge of the depression may still trap dust grains, giving rise to transition disc like observational signatures. We also present a first-order prescription to approximate this behaviour in one dimensional disc evolution models, suitable for use in planet formation and population synthesis studies. Although the prescription improves upon static mass-loss treatments, it remains approximate, underscoring the need for further multidimensional simulations and parameter-space exploration to derive robust recipes for global disc and planet population models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bound Dark Energy: Particle Physics model in alignment with recent DESI cosmological measurements</a><span class="id">[2601.08943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observational constraints on the Bound Dark Energy Cold Dark Matter (BDE-CDM) model using DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation measurements combined with Planck CMB data and Type Ia supernovae compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, DESY5). In BDE-CDM, dark energy originates from the lightest meson field within a supersymmetric SU(3) dark gauge group with $N_f = 6$ flavors, governed by an inverse power-law potential $V(\phi) = \Lambda_{c}^{4+2/3} \phi^{-2/3}$. Unlike $\Lambda$CDM and $w_0w_a$CDM, the dark energy sector contains no free parameters – the condensation scale $\Lambda_c$ and transition epoch $a_c$ are determined by gauge coupling unification constraints. The equation of state evolves from relativistic behavior ($w = 1/3$) before condensation through a kinetic-dominated stiff phase ($w \simeq 1$), approaching $w_0 = -0.9298 \pm 0.0003$ at present, with $w &gt; -1$ maintained throughout cosmic history, avoiding phantom-regime instabilities. We obtain $\Lambda_{c} = 43.93 \pm 0.13$ eV and $a_c = (2.489 \pm 0.007) \times 10^{-6}$, consistent with theoretical predictions. The $w_0$-$w_a$ confidence contours are approximately 10,000 times smaller than those of $w_0w_a$CDM while achieving comparable fits, and remain stable across different supernova datasets. Statistical analysis yields $\Delta\mathrm{DIC} = -6.77$ and $\Delta\mathrm{AIC} = -8.97$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM for BAO+DESY5, constituting strong evidence favoring BDE-CDM model. The model predicts distinctive signatures including 25\% enhancement in the matter power spectrum at $k \approx 4.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. These results establish BDE-CDM as a theoretically motivated framework that successfully addresses the DESI-observed preference for dynamical dark energy while connecting particle physics with cosmological observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation and evolution of planetary systems</a><span class="id">[2601.08952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Various problems of the formation and evolution of planetary systems are studied. Most of the studies are devoted to the Solar System. The collapse of the presolar cloud and the accumulation of planets are studied. The author considers the formation of the Earth-Moon system, binary trans-Neptunian objects, and the axial rotations of planets. He discusses the formation of asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, including the evolution of resonant asteroid orbits and the formation of the Kirkwood gaps in the asteroid belt. The book discusses the migration of bodies during the formation of the Solar System and at present, including a discussion of the delivery of icy bodies from beyond the ice line to the terrestrial planets and the formation of craters on the Moon. The Deep Impact mission is discussed; during this mission the impact module of the spacecraft collided with the comet Tempel 1. The book studies the migration of dust in the Solar System and the formation of the zodiacal belt, as well as the migration of bodies and dust particles ejected from the terrestrial planets and the Moon. The author considers the migration of bodies in some exoplanetary systems (Proxima Centauri, Trappist 1, and Gliese 581), the spectra of Earth-like exoplanets with different rotation periods, as well as the efficiency of exoplanet searches using microlensing observations with various telescopes.

Pebbles settling through such atmospheres continuously release gravitational potential energy, heating both the atmosphere and the pebbles. Under these conditions, atmosphere temperatures above large protoplanets are sufficiently high to melt silicate pebbles, support long-lived magma oceans, and drive evaporation of volatile species. Because these atmospheres are open to the nebula, some amount of volatile loss is inevitable. Here we analyze the depletion of moderately volatile elements from terrestrial protoplanets undergoing pebble accretion. We consider chondrule-size silicate pebbles enriched in Si, Na, K, and Zn relative to Earth, settling through a hydrogen-helium-rich atmosphere containing these same volatiles. We show that volatile depletion depends critically on protoplanet mass, the timescale of atmosphere exhaust, and the pebble composition. The protoplanetary mass effect is especially strong. For exhaust timescales of a few centuries, we find that substantial depletion of Zn begins around 0.4 Earth mass, and for Na and K around 0.6 Earth mass, with negligible depletion of these elements at smaller masses. Using a pebble composition that matches Earth's major element abundances, broad agreement with Earth's depletion trend for moderately volatile elements is found by merging a large (approximately 0.7 Earth mass) volatile-depleted target protoplanet with one or more smaller, less-depleted impactors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Multi-Method Age Determination for the Ursa Major Moving Group</a><span class="id">[2601.08985]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Ursa Major Moving Group (UMa) is one of the closest stellar associations, yet its age has remained controversial, with published estimates ranging from 200 Myr to 1 Gyr. We present a comprehensive age analysis using the largest sample of candidate UMa members to date. Using Gaia DR3, we identify 1172 stars within 100 pc of the Sun with 3D kinematic motions consistent with group membership. We determine the age of UMa's dominant population using three independent methods: lithium equivalent widths $(393.6^{+85.1}_{-80.9}\,\mathrm{Myr})$, gyrochronology $(428 \pm 93\,\mathrm{Myr})$, and photometric variability indicators $(449^{+114}_{-79}\,\mathrm{Myr})$. The three methods converge on a consistent age of $418^{+32}_{-34}\,\mathrm{Myr}$. While our kinematic selection includes field stars that share UMa's space motion but are not coeval members, the convergent age determinations clearly identify a dominant population that formed together approximately 400 Myr ago. These stars are important benchmarks for studies of stellar rotation, magnetic activity evolution, and lithium depletion. The presence of systems such as HD 63433, a young multiplanet host within the group, further illustrates the value of UMa as a laboratory for early planetary system evolution. Our expanded catalog of kinematic candidates lays the groundwork for spectroscopic membership confirmation, refined mapping of the group's structure and chemistry, and future investigations of both stellar and planetary evolution at this key epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09005" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The IRIS$^{2+}$ inversion tool: recovering the radiative losses and the thermodynamics in the lower solar atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2601.09005]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce an improved and fast inversion tool that is able to provide the thermodynamics of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the top of the chromosphere, as well as the integrated radiative losses in the chromosphere for data observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). This NASA mission has been observing the Sun and providing, among other kinds of data, multi-line spectral observations sensitive to changes in the lower solar atmosphere since 2013. In this paper, we explain the new inversion tool IRIS$^{2+}$ based on the IRIS$^{2+}$ database, which is based on 135,472 synthetic representative profiles (RP), each of them consisting of 6 chromospheric lines and 6 photospheric lines, their corresponding representative model atmospheres (RMA), and the integrated radiative losses (IRL) associated with these atmospheres. A nearest neighbor (k-nn) model algorithm is trained with the synthetic representative profiles to predict the closest RP in the database to the one observed, at which point IRIS$^{2+}$ assigns the RMA and the IRL to the location of that observed profile. We have compared the results obtained by IRIS$^{2+}$ with results obtained from the state-of-the-art inversion code STiC, which is also used to build the IRIS$^{2+}$ database. We find that the thermodynamics and the IRL obtained with both methods are comparable in most cases. Therefore, IRIS$^{2+}$ is a fast and reliable inversion tool that provides approximate values of the thermodynamic state and the radiative losses in the lower solar atmosphere for a large variety of solar scenes observed with IRIS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of inverse Compton losses on particle acceleration in three-dimensional relativistic reconnection</a><span class="id">[2601.09052]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic magnetic reconnection is a key mechanism for dissipating magnetic energy and accelerating particles in astrophysics. In the absence of radiative cooling, recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations have shown that high-energy particles gain most of their energy in the upstream region, during a short-lived &quot;free phase&quot; where they meander between the two sides of the layer; when they get captured/trapped by the downstream flux ropes, they undergo a &quot;trapped phase&quot;, where no significant energization occurs. Here, we perform a suite of 3D PIC simulations of relativistic reconnection including inverse Compton (IC) losses in the weakly cooled regime in which the radiation-reaction-limited Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm rad}$ exceeds the magnetization $\sigma$. We show that electron cooling losses do not appreciably alter the reconnection rate, the structure of the layer, and the physics of particle acceleration in the free phase, so the spectrum of free electrons is $dN_{\rm free}/d\gamma \propto \gamma^{-1}$, as in the uncooled case. The spectrum of trapped electrons above the cooling break $\gamma_{\rm cool}$ (in the range $\gamma_{\rm cool}&lt;\gamma&lt;\gamma_{\rm rad}$) is $dN/d\gamma \propto \gamma^{-3}$, steeper than the scaling $dN/d\gamma \propto \gamma^{-2}$ of uncooled simulations. This confirms that no significant particle energization occurs during the trapped phase. Our results validate the model by arXiv:2302.12269 for particle acceleration in 3D relativistic reconnection, and imply that radiative emission models of reconnection-powered astrophysical sources should employ a two-zone structure, that differentiates between free, rapidly accelerating particles and trapped, passively cooling particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper limits on microhertz gravitational waves from supermassive black-hole binaries using PSR J1909-3744 data from the second IPTA data release</a><span class="id">[2601.09054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of a search for gravitational waves (GWs) from individual sources using high-cadence observations of PSR J1909\(-\)3744 obtained during an intensive observing campaign with the International Pulsar Timing Array second data release (IPTA-DR2) between July 2010 and November 2012.

We investigate such pre-SN eruptions using \texttt{SNEC} hydrodynamic simulations and realistic stellar models, parameterizing the nuclear energy deposition as a fraction of the binding energy of the combined He layer and H-rich envelope. For the lowest-mass model (9 $M_\odot$), the ejecta mass ($M_{\rm ej}$) scales with the energy gained by the H-rich envelope via a power law (index$\sim$3.5). Across 9-10 $M_\odot$, this relation shows limited scatter within a factor of $\sim$2.6, enabling an estimation of the gained energy from $M_{\rm ej}$. The shock passage also flattens the bound envelope, which can affect the SN light curve morphology and provide another diagnostic for the eruption. Then, we compute the associated precursor light curves for the 9 $M_\odot$ model with the multi-group radiative-transfer code \texttt{STELLA}. These signals are typically faint, with bolometric luminosities of $\sim10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ lasting hundreds of days. Their cool black-body spectra make them brighter in the infrared, yet several magnitudes fainter than observed pre-SN precursors at the threshold for full envelope ejection. To aid future studies, we make our post-eruption stellar profiles and precursor light curves publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ring-Gap Structures in the Class I Circumstellar Disk of CrA IRS 2 Associated with Magnetic Flux-Driven Bubble</a><span class="id">[2601.09070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent ALMA observations with 0”.1 resolution reveal characteristic substructures in circumstellar disks around young Class I sources, providing clues to the early stages of morphological disk evolution. In this paper, we applied PRIISM imaging to ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data of the circumstellar disk around the Class I protostar CrA IRS 2, located in the Corona Australis molecular cloud, which is associated with an extended gas ring attributed to magnetic flux advection driven by interchange instability. The dust continuum image with 1.5 times higher spatial resolution than conventional imaging revealed, for the first time, the early-phase circumstellar disk with both inner central hole and outer ring-gap structures, making CrA IRS 2 the youngest system exhibiting such features based on the bolometric temperature of $T_{\rm bol}$=235 K. To examine planet-disk interaction as one possible origin of the outer ring-gap structure, we found the measured depth and width to be consistent with planet-disk interaction models, suggesting the existence of a giant planet with a mass of 0.1-1.8 $M_{\rm Jup}$. The additional mechanism required for rapid planet formation could be the magnetic flux dissipation driven by the interchange instability, which suppresses MRI-driven turbulence and extends the dead zone, allowing efficient dust growth and the early formation of planets. This system thus provides new insight into how substructures and planet formation can emerge during the early, accreting phase of disk evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Progenitor of the Type II-Plateau SN 2025pht in NGC 1637: The Dustiest, Most Luminous Red Supergiant So Far?</a><span class="id">[2601.09087]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We provide a characterization of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby Type II-plateau supernova (SN) 2025pht in NGC 1637. The star was first detectable in 2001 by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and then again in a dozen bands by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in 2024. This &quot;quasi-snapshot&quot; of the star's nature almost immediately prior to explosion is unprecedented. The RSG varied in brightness, and we posit that it could have been a pulsating variable, possibly with a long period of  660 days. The largest uncertainty is the host-galaxy distance, which we establish to be 10.73+/-1.76 Mpc. The star was also heavily extinguished by interstellar dust internal to the host, with visual extinction A_V(host) 1.7 mag (total A_V(tot) 1.8 mag). Dust radiative-transfer modeling reveals the star's circumstellar medium to be quite dusty and silicate-rich, yielding a bolometric luminosity log(L_bol/L_Sun)=5.08+/-0.16 and a cool effective temperature T_eff=2100–2500 K. The available HST optical data had no bearing on the shape of the candidate's observed spectral energy distribution – for the first time, without the archival JWST observations we would not have been able to detect and characterize the candidate at all. The SN 2025pht progenitor candidate, although quite similar to that of SN 2023ixf, may be the most luminous candidate identified to date.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal alignment and tidal torquing modeling for the cosmic shear three-point correlation function and mass aperture skewness</a><span class="id">[2601.09133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a model for the intrinsic alignment contamination of the shear three-point correlation function and skewness of the mass aperture statistic using the tidal alignment and tidal torquing (TATT) formalism. We compute the intrinsic alignment bispectra components in terms of the TATT model parameters. We consider two effective field theory approaches in the literature, relate them to the TATT model parameters and an extension to TATT that includes the velocity-shear (VS) parameter. We compare the impact of changing between NLA, TATT, and TATT+VS on the theoretical computation of the 3PCF using the best fit parameters and tomographic redshift distributions from Dark Energy Survey Year 3. We find that the TATT model significantly impacts the skewed triangle configurations of the 3PCF. Additionally, including the higher-order effects from TATT can introduce opposite effects on the two-point function and on the mass aperture skewness, damping the signal of the former while boosting the signal of the latter. We argue that a joint 2PCF+3PCF analysis with the TATT model can help break the degeneracy between its model parameters and provide more robust constraints on both cosmology and intrinsic alignment amplitude parameters. We show that typical values of order unity for the intrinsic alignment parameters introduce differences of around $10\%$ between NLA and TATT predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09226" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of a puzzling dual-superorbital hard X-ray modulation in the X-ray binary GX 301-2</a><span class="id">[2601.09226]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The superorbital modulations (SMs) observed in wind-fed X-ray binaries remain a puzzling phenomenon in astrophysics. To investigate this behavior observationally, we analyzed the long-term hard X-ray light curve from the Swift/BAT 157-Month Hard X-ray Survey in X-ray binary GX 301-2. Using three timing analysis methods–the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, the weighted wavelet Ztransform, and Gaussian processes–we identify a rare dual-SM behavior in this source: the 115-day modulation exceeds the 5$\sigma$ global significance level, whereas the 65-day signal only marginally reaches the 4$\sigma$ level. Because the 115-day period is more consistent with the previously reported linear relation between orbital and superorbital periods, we interpret 115 days as the actual superorbital period, while the weaker and less stable 65-day period is its beat modulation with the orbital this http URL assessing the applicability of different physical scenarios to our results, we suggest that this dual-SM behavior is most plausibly associated with corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in the stellar wind. This framework can also account for the observed linear orbital-superorbital relation, despite the unclear physical mechanism that sets the apparent ratio between the CIR and orbital periods across sources. Further long-term monitoring of this system, together with continued theoretical development of the CIR scenario, will be essential for clarifying the origin of wind-fed SMs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIRPS tightens the mass estimate of GJ 3090 b and detects a planet near the stellar rotation period</a><span class="id">[2601.09330]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an updated characterization of the planetary system orbiting the nearby M2 dwarf GJ 3090 (TOI-177; $d = 22$ pc), based on new high-precision radial velocity (RV) observations from NIRPS and HARPS. With an orbital period of 2.85 d, the transiting sub-Neptune GJ 3090 b has a mass we refine to $4.52 \pm 0.47 M_{\oplus}$, which, combined with our derived radius of $2.18 \pm 0.06 R_{\oplus}$, yields a density of $2.40^{+0.33}_{-0.30}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The combined interior structure and atmospheric constraints indicate that GJ 3090 b is a compelling water-world candidate, with a volatile-rich envelope in which water likely represents a significant fraction. We also confirm the presence of a second planet, GJ 3090 c, a sub-Neptune with a 15.9 d orbit and a minimum mass of $10.0 \pm 1.3 M_{\oplus}$, which does not transit. Despite its proximity to the star's 18 d rotation period, our joint analysis using a multidimensional Gaussian process (GP) model that incorporates TESS photometry and differential stellar temperature measurements distinguishes this planetary signal from activity-induced variability. In addition, we place new constraints on a non-transiting planet candidate with a period of 12.7 d, suggested in earlier RV analyses. This candidate remains a compelling target for future monitoring. These results highlight the crucial role of multidimensional GP modelling in disentangling planetary signals from stellar activity, enabling the detection of a planet near the stellar rotation period that could have remained undetected with traditional approaches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Owl-z: a Bayesian tool to select z \geq 7 quasars</a><span class="id">[2601.09332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents Owl-z, a Bayesian code aiming at identifying z \geq 7 quasars in wide field optical and near-infrared surveys. By construction,the code can also be used to select objects that contaminate the high-z quasar population, i.e. brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts. The code can be adapted for the selection of high-z galaxies, and although it has been tuned to the Euclid Wide Survey, it can be easily adapted to other photometric surveys. The code input data are the object's photometric data and its galactic longitude and latitude, and the code output data are the probabilities of the modelled populations of high-z quasars, brown dwarfs and early-type galaxies at intermediate redshift. As part of the validation, Owl-z could re-identify all spectroscopically confirmed quasars at z \geq 7, demonstrating the code's versatility in applying to different photometric catalogues. The performance of Owl-z, based on a metric combining completeness and purity called F-measure, is analysed in the case of Euclid using simulated data in a wide range of redshifts (7 \leq z \leq 12) and H-band Euclid magnitudes (18 \leq H_E \leq 24.5). The results show that Owl-z reaches full performance for bright sources (H_E \lesssim 22), independently of the redshift. We show that the probability threshold used to select promising quasar candidates can be adjusted after processing to fine-tune the F-measure value of candidates depending on their magnitude and redshift estimates. We show that for objects brighter than about two magnitudes above the survey detection limit, Owl-z provides a classification that will facilitate the optimisation of photometric and spectroscopic confirmation campaigns. In conclusion, Owl-z is a powerful public tool to help select high-z quasars, brown dwarfs or early-type galaxies at intermediate redshifts in Euclid or other wide-field surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Plasma Properties of the Fanaroff-Riley Jet can Shape its Morphology</a><span class="id">[2601.09349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extragalactic jets are broadly classified into two categories based on radio observations: core-brightened jets, known as Fanaroff-Riley Type I (FR I), and edge-brightened jets, classified as Type II (FR II). This FR dichotomy may arise due to variation in the ambient medium and/or the properties of the jet itself, such as injection speed, temperature, composition, magnetization, etc. To investigate this, we perform large-scale three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (3D-MHD) simulations of low-power, supersonic jets extending to kiloparsec scales. We inject a jet beam carrying an initially toroidal magnetic field into a denser, unmagnetized, and stratified ambient medium through a cylindrical nozzle. Our simulations explore jets with varying injection parameters to investigate their impact on morphology and emission properties. Furthermore, we examine jets with significantly different plasma compositions, such as hadronic and mixed electron-positron-proton configurations, to study the conditions that may drive transitions between FR I and FR II morphologies. We find that, under the same injection parameters, mixed plasma composition jets tend to evolve into FR I structures. In contrast, electron-proton jets exhibit a transition between FR I and FR II morphologies at different stages of their evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Beaming Shapes the Demographics of Ultraluminous X-ray Sources?</a><span class="id">[2601.09425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are off-nuclear compact objects with apparent luminosities above 10^39 erg/s, often exceeding the Eddington limit for stellar-mass black holes. Beaming is a commonly invoked mechanism to explain their extreme brightness, and the dependence of the beaming factor on accretion rate is a critical parameter. In this work, we investigate how different beaming prescriptions affect the predicted properties of ULX populations. Using binary population synthesis, we construct synthetic X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) for both classical and log-modified beaming models at solar and sub-solar metallicities. The classical model predicts a larger intrinsic number of bright ULXs, but strong beaming reduces their observable fraction, resulting in fewer visible ULXs compared to the log-modified model. The log-modified prescription yields a shallower slope at high-luminosity, aligning better with observed XLFs, and increases the fraction of observable neutron star ULXs above 10^39 erg/s. These results underscore the significant role of the beaming law in shaping ULX statistical distributions and assessing neutron star contributions to the population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09438" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mass estimates of the young TOI-451 transiting planets: Multidimensional Gaussian Process on stellar spectroscopic and photometric signals</a><span class="id">[2601.09438]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The young TOI-451 planetary system, aged 125 Myr, provides a unique opportunity to test theories of planetary internal structures and atmospheric mass loss through examination of its three transiting planets. We present an exhaustive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up to determine the orbital and physical properties of the system. We perform multidimensional Gaussian Process regression with the code pyaneti on spectroscopic time-series and NGTS/LCO light curves to disentangle the stellar and planetary signal in ESPRESSO radial velocities. We show how contemporaneous photometry serves as an activity indicator to inform RV modelling within a multidimensional Gaussian Processes framework. We argue that this can be exploited when spectroscopic observations are adversely affected by low signal-to-noise and/or poor sampling. We estimate the Doppler semi-amplitudes of Kb = 2.6(+1.1,-1.2) m/s, Kc = 1.2(+1.0,-0.8) m/s and Kd = 2.7 +/- 1.2 m/s. This translates into 2-sigma mass estimates for TOI-451 b and d of Mb = 4.7(+2.1,-2.2) Earth masses and Md = 10.2(+4.6,-4.5) Earth masses, as well as a mass upper limit for TOI-451 c of Mc &lt; 11.5 Earth masses. The derived planetary properties suggest that planets c and d contain significant hydrogen-rich envelopes. The inferred parameters of TOI-451 b are consistent with either a rocky world that still retains a small hydrogen envelope or a water world. These insights make the TOI-451 system an ideal laboratory for future follow-up studies aimed at measuring atmospheric compositions, detecting atmospheric mass-loss signatures, and further exploring planetary formation and evolution processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09468" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-fidelity lunar topographic reconstruction across diverse terrain and illumination environments using deep learning</a><span class="id">[2601.09468]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Topographic models are essential for characterizing planetary surfaces and for inferring underlying geological processes. Nevertheless, meter-scale topographic data remain limited, which constrains detailed planetary investigations, even for the Moon, where extensive high-resolution orbital images are available. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) exploit single-view imagery, constrained by low-resolution topography, for fast and flexible reconstruction of fine-scale topography. However, their robustness and general applicability across diverse lunar landforms and illumination conditions remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we build upon our previously proposed DL framework by incorporating a more robust scale recovery scheme and extending the model to polar regions under low solar illumination conditions. We demonstrate that, compared with single-view shape-from-shading methods, the proposed DL approach exhibits greater robustness to varying illumination and achieves more consistent and accurate topographic reconstructions. Furthermore, it reliably reconstructs topography across lunar features of diverse scales, morphologies, and geological ages. High-quality topographic models are also produced for the lunar south polar areas, including permanently shadowed regions, demonstrating the method's capability in reconstructing complex and low-illumination terrain. These findings suggest that DL-based approaches have the potential to leverage extensive lunar datasets to support advanced exploration missions and enable investigations of the Moon at unprecedented topographic resolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Piecewise Power-Law Reconstruction of the Gravitational-Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2601.09481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The NANOGrav 15-year (NG15) data set provides evidence for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) signal at nanohertz frequencies, which is expected to originate either from a cosmic population of inspiraling supermassive black-hole binaries or new particle physics in the early Universe. A firm identification of the source of the NG15 signal requires an accurate reconstruction of its frequency spectrum. In this paper, we provide such a spectral characterization of the NG15 signal based on a piecewise power-law (PPL) ansatz that strikes a balance between existing alternatives in the literature. Our PPL reconstruction is more flexible than the standard constant-power-law model, which describes the GWB spectrum in terms of only two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index gamma. Concurrently, it better approximates physically realistic GWB spectra – especially those of cosmological origin – than the free spectral model, since the latter allows for arbitrary variations in the GWB amplitude from one frequency bin to the next. Our PPL reconstruction of the NG15 signal relies on individual PPL models with a fixed number of internal nodes (i.e., constant power law, broken power law, doubly broken power law, etc.) that are ultimately combined in a Bayesian model average. The data products resulting from our analysis provide the basis for fast refits of spectral GWB models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demographics of Close-In TESS Exoplanets Orbiting FGK Main-sequence Stars</a><span class="id">[2601.09492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the demographics of close-in planets is crucial for insights into exoplanet formation and evolution.

Our study uses a comprehensive sample from four years of TESS Science Processing Operations Center full-frame image data cross-matched with Gaia, analysed through our rigorous detection, vetting, and validation pipeline. Using high-confidence planet candidates, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian model to determine occurrence rates in the two-dimensional orbital period-radius plane. Our results are presented using 10-by-10 bins across the period-radius parameter space, offering unprecedented resolution and statistical precision. We find an overall occurrence rate of $9.4^{+0.7}_{-0.6}\%$. When using identical binning, our occurrence rate posteriors distributions align with Kepler's but have a magnitude smaller uncertainties on average. For hot Jupiters, we estimate the overall occurrence rate of $0.39^{+0.03}_{-0.02}\%$. This value is consistent with the previous Kepler FGK-type result within $1\sigma$. We find an overall occurrence rate of Neptunian desert planets of $0.08\pm0.01\%$, to our knowledge the first such determination. Additionally, in a volume-limited Gaia subsample within 100 pc in the same parameter region, we measure an overall planet occurrence rate of $15.4^{+1.6}_{-1.5}\%$ and a hot Jupiter occurrence rate of $0.42^{+0.16}_{-0.12}\%$.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs) encode the integrated electron column density along their lines of sight, offering a unique probe of both the cosmic expansion rate ($H_0$) and the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$). However, constraints from FRBs alone suffer from a severe $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ degeneracy that prevents them from resolving either problem independently. We show that this degeneracy can be broken by combining FRBs with other emerging probes whose degeneracy directions differ in the $H_0$-$\Omega_{\rm b}$ plane. Specifically, we quantify three multi-messenger approaches: FRBs paired with gravitational wave (GW) standard sirens, strong gravitational lensing (SGL) time delays, and 21 cm intensity mapping (IM). The combinations FRB+GW, FRB+SGL, and FRB+21 cm IM each deliver simultaneous constraints on $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ better than ($1\%$, $1\%$) in the $\Lambda$CDM model, ($1.5\%$, $2\%$) in the $w$CDM model, and ($2\%$, $3.5\%$) in the CPL model. Moreover, in a model-independent framework, both FRB+GW and FRB+SGL constrain $H_0$ and $\Omega_{\rm b}$ to better than ($1\%$, $2\%$) precision. These results demonstrate that the synergy between FRBs and other emerging probes holds great promise for resolving the Hubble tension and locating the missing baryons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09529" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strange quark star I: the maximum gravitational mass and deformation of magnetized spinning model</a><span class="id">[2601.09529]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the structural parameters of strange quark stars (SQS) under the influence of strong magnetic fields and varying rotational frequencies.

While there is no minimum limit for the mass of slowly rotating self-bound stars, by computing the maximum rotational frequency, known as the mass-shedding limit, we show that SQS must have a minimum mass to sustain high rotational frequencies. The mass-shedding frequency in our EOS model is lower than that estimated from the MIT bag model EOS with a fixed bag constant. The Keplerian frequency in our model depends linearly on the gravitational mass at the mass-shedding limit (and similarly on the minimum mass) with the slope of 0.08 ${\rm kHz}/M_\odot$.

Previous work has been able to study small EUV and SXR brightenings outside of active regions (i.e. the quiet Sun), but with HXRs this has mostly focused on active region transients/microflares due to the sensitivity of available telescopes. In this paper we present observations of the quiet Sun with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), an X-ray imaging spectrometer with much greater sensitivity than previous instruments, allowing the observation of faint events. During the recent solar minimum, NuSTAR captured seven quiet Sun flares/impulsive brightenings, three on 21 February 2020, and four on 12-13 September 2020. From fitting their NuSTAR HXR spectra we find temperatures of 3.1-4.0 MK and emission measures between (0.75-17.0) $\times 10^{43}$ cm$^{-3}$, which gives thermal energies between (2.5-8.9) $\times 10^{26}$ erg. Only one event, a mini-filament eruption, showed evidence of slightly higher temperatures emission, confirmed through Differential Emission Measure analysis. None of the events showed evidence of non-thermal emission in their NuSTAR spectra, and we placed upper limits to the accelerated electron population. The thermal parameters for these quiet Sun events seem to scale differently to previously studied active region flares, suggesting a different energy release process might be dominating. However, this conclusion is affected by the different sensitivity and biases introduced by the various instruments and analysis approaches used.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blowouts of Nascent Wind Bubbles in Pulsar-Driven Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.09552]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Formation of a rapidly spinning, strongly magnetized neutron star (NS) may occur in various classes of core-collapse events. If the NS injects an amount of energy comparable to the explosion energy of the accompanying supernova (SN) before the SN ejecta becomes transparent, the nascent NS wind bubble can overtake the outer ejecta and undergo a blowout driven by hydrodynamic instabilities. Based on multidimensional numerical studies, we construct a minimal semi-analytic framework to follow the post-blowout dynamics and radiative evolution, map the blowout conditions by scanning the ejecta and NS parameters, and compute survey-ready multi-band light curves. For stripped-envelope SNe with an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ej} \sim 10\,M_\odot$ and an explosion energy of $E_\mathrm{sn} \sim 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}$, blowout occurs for NSs with magnetic field strengths of $B_{\mathrm{dip}} \gtrsim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{G}$ and spin periods of $P_\mathrm{NS} \lesssim \mathrm{a\ few}\,\mathrm{ms}$. Relatively weak-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \lesssim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ produce luminous double-peaked UV/optical light curves, as observed in the superluminous SN LSQ14bdq, while stronger-field cases with $B_\mathrm{dip} \gtrsim 10^{14}\,\mathrm{G}$ result in hypernovae preceded by X-ray blowout precursors. We also examine weaker and lower-mass SN explosions representing ultra-stripped SNe and accretion- or merger-induced collapse events, in which blowout is more readily achieved over a broader range of NS parameters, producing fast X-ray transients with durations of $ 10^{2\mbox{--}4}\,\mathrm{s}$ and peak luminosities of $10^{42\mbox{--}48}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$.

Stellar occultations provide highly accurate size and shape measurements for TNOs, while photometry constrains their albedo and surface colours. (28978) Ixion is one of the largest TNOs and a prominent Plutino, making it a key target for comparative studies. We aim to constrain Ixion's projected size, shape, absolute magnitude, geometric albedo, and surface colours, and to search for evidence of an atmosphere or circum-object material. We analysed stellar occultation campaigns by Ixion conducted between 2020 and 2023 within the Lucky Star collaboration, comprising 51 observations from eight events, including 30 positive detections. Five multi-chord events enabled a global limb fit and an accurate reconstruction of Ixion's projected shape. The occultations reveal a slightly elongated limb well represented by a single projected ellipse, yielding an area-equivalent diameter of $D_{\mathrm{equiv}} = 696.78^{+10.75}_{-8.87}$ km and an apparent oblateness $\epsilon' = 0.081^{+0.004}_{-0.010}$. Typical radial residuals of order $\sim$10 km indicate a largely stable shape across epochs, with modest epoch-dependent variations.

We present here a time-resolved spectroscopic analysis of the burst, along with the detection of burst oscillations within a 51-second interval during the decay phase. The oscillation frequency is measured to be $\nu = 413.674 \pm 0.002\,\mathrm{Hz}$, consistent with previous reports. However, we detect a significant downward frequency drift over the burst duration, characterized by $\dot{\nu} = (-4.7 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Hz\,s^{-1}}$. This frequency evolution is atypical compared to those observed in similar burst oscillation sources. We tentatively attribute the observed drift to a Doppler shift induced by orbital motion. Under this interpretation, the inferred orbital period must be shorter than 20 minutes, placing \textit{4U 0614+091} among the most compact known low-mass X-ray binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chiellini-Integrable Cosmologies with Phantom Divide Crossing</a><span class="id">[2601.09271]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate exact cosmological solutions with a massive scalar field minimally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action in General Relativity.

We analyze whether the expanding branch of the solutions can describe a late-time cosmic acceleration, using a combined statistical analysis of BAO, CMB, cosmic chronometer and Pantheon+SHOES supernova datasets. A crucial outcome of this exercise is the analytical emergence of a smooth phantom divide crossing in the dark energy equation of state, achieved without introducing any pathological instabilities. The reconstruction yields a present-day Hubble parameter $H_0 \gtrsim 70 \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, with a reduced tension relative to the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. The results indicate that Chiellini-integrable scalar cosmologies are capable of providing a robust and analytically controlled framework for modeling late-time cosmic acceleration and phantom divide crossing, offering a viable alternative to phenomenological dark-energy parametrizations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09309" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sub-Leading Logarithms for Scalar Potential Models on de Sitter</a><span class="id">[2601.09309]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The continual production of long wavelength scalars and gravitons during inflation injects secular growth into loop corrections which would be constant in flat space.

Loop corrections that attain this number are known as “leading logarithms”; those with fewer are sub-leading. Starobinsky's stochastic formalism has long been known to reproduce the leading logarithms of scalar potential models.

Fluid in these regions is unstable to semi-convection, with motions driven by differences in the molecular diffusivity of temperature and composition, and could play a role in supporting planetary magnetic fields. Previous studies focus largely on local models in Cartesian boxes; here, we investigate semi-convection in rotating spherical shells. The onset of linear instability shows a transition between the two limits of rotating convection and non-rotating semi-convection. Non-linear simulations evolve into a system of concentric layers of relatively constant density, separated by narrow high-gradient regions. These layers gradually merge, resulting in a statistically steady state dominated by either a single convection region or a narrower convective zone beneath a stably stratified layer (SSL), depending on the strength of the thermal forcing compared to the rotation. When magnetic field generation is considered, our magnetohydrodynamic simulations exhibit self-sustained dynamo action. In cases where the turbulent convective region generates magnetic fields that are smoothed by zonal flows within the overlying SSL, the resulting field is strongly dipolar and axisymmetric, in encouraging agreement with Saturn's observed magnetic field. Within the regimes explored, both the Rossby number and the thickness of the SSL are well predicted by a single combination of control parameters. This enables the identification of a parameter range in which the generated magnetic fields resemble those of planetary dynamos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09596" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plasma wakes driven by Compton scattering: Non-linear regime and particle acceleration</a><span class="id">[2601.09596]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate plasma wake generation via Compton scattering from photon bursts, a non-ponderomotive process relevant when the photon wavelength is smaller than the interparticle distance but larger than the Compton wavelength.

Perfectly collimated drivers produce wakes propagating at the speed of light, allowing electron phase-locking (limited by driver depletion). Non-collimated drivers induce subluminal phase velocities, limiting acceleration via dephasing. Two-dimensional simulations reveal unique transverse fields compared to laser wakefields, with a DC magnetic field leading to consistent focusing.

To obtain benchmark results and to analyze the ringdown dynamics from generic perturbations, we further employ a 2+1-dimensional numerical time-evolution framework. This approach enables a systematic quantification of theoretical uncertainties across multiple angular harmonics, a broad range of spin parameters, and progressively stronger deviations from the Kerr geometry. We then confront these modeling errors with simple projections of statistical uncertainties in quasinormal mode frequencies as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio, thereby exploring the domain of validity of approximate methods for prospective high-precision black-hole spectroscopy.

We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the kilonova optical light curves. We use the simulated population of kilonovae to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of kilonova detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5.

The physical mechanism driving these properties remains elusive. We construct spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with spectroscopic redshift for 28 LRDs and find they exhibit V-shaped SEDs with a common break frequency of $\nu_{\rm b}\simeq10^{14.96\pm0.06}$ Hz. We propose that the unique SEDs can be well explained by the combination of an inner standard disk and an outer gravitationally unstable accretion disk with Toomre parameter $Q\sim1$, where the outer disk has a temperature of $\sim2000-4000 K$ and mainly radiates in near-infrared to optical wavebands. The composite spectrum from this model naturally explains the V-shaped continuum and reproduces intrinsically luminous infrared-optical emission without requiring extreme dust extinction or unusual stellar populations. Even considering possible dense gas around the disk to account for pronounced Balmer breaks in some LRDs, the intrinsic optical-UV emission is only suppressed by factors of $\lesssim2-3$, which suggests that most LRDs are sub-Eddington and intrinsically weak. These results provide new insights into early-phase black hole growth and galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forecasting Constraints on Non-Thermal Light Massive Relics from Future CMB Experiments (CMB-S4/Simons Observatory)</a><span class="id">[2505.22775]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we present Fisher forecasts on \textit{non-thermal LiMR} models for a CMB Stage IV-like experiment and the Simons Observatory – particularly focusing on a model of inflaton/moduli decay giving rise to non-thermally distributed dark sector particles, and also comparing our results with those for sterile particles following the Dodelson-Widrow distribution. Two independent parameters, $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ and $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$, influence linear cosmological observables. We find $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff}$ to be more tightly constrained (by a factor of $10$) for a less abundant, heavier LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic around matter-radiation equality than a more abundant, lighter LiMR which becomes fully non-relativistic just after recombination. The uncertainties on $M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}$ differ by a factor of $\sim3$ between the two cases. Our analysis also reveals distinct parameter correlations: the phenomenological parameters $\{\Delta N_\mathrm{eff},M_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{eff}\}$ are found to be negatively correlated for the former case and positively correlated for the latter. We obtain similar projected uncertainties on the cosmological parameters (in either case) for both the inflaton/moduli decay and the Dodelson-Widrow models when the first two moments of the LiMR distribution function, related to the phenomenological parameters, are matched. Finally, by constructing a modified distribution that matches the first two moments of the Dodelson-Widrow but deviates maximally in the third moment, we demonstrate that CMB Stage IV data is not expected to be sensitive to higher moments of the distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11518" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting Cosmic Distance Duality with Megamasers and DESI DR2 Observations: Model Independent Constraints on Early-Late Calibration</a><span class="id">[2507.11518]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) connects the angular diameter distance ($d_A$) and the luminosity distance ($d_L$) at a given redshift. This fundamental relation holds in any metric theory of gravity, provided that photon number is conserved and light propagates along null geodesics. A deviation from this relation could indicate new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, we test the validity of the CDDR at very low redshifts ($z &lt; 0.04$) by combining $d_A$ from the Megamaser Cosmology Project with $d_L$ from the Pantheon+ sample of Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa). We further incorporate high-redshift Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO)-based $d_A$ measurements from DESI DR2 in combination with SNIa data, highlighting the critical role of the $r_d-M_b$ (early-late) calibration in testing the CDDR using these two probes. Assuming CDDR holds, we perform a Bayesian analysis to derive model-independent constraints on the calibration parameters. Using only BAO and SNIa data, we observe a strong degeneracy between $r_d$ and $M_b$. However, the inclusion of calibration-free Megamaser measurements breaks this degeneracy, enabling independent constraints without relying on a specific cosmological model or distance-ladder techniques. Additionally, we present a forecast incorporating the expected precision from future Megamaser and SNIa observations, demonstrating their potential to significantly tighten constraints on early-late calibration parameters, under the assumption of validity of CDDR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridging the gap: consistent modeling of protoplanetary disk heating and gap formation by planet-induced spiral shocks</a><span class="id">[2507.18283]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A giant planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk excites spiral density waves, which steepen into shocks as they propagate away from the planet.

To date, these two effects have largely been modeled independently. In this study, we present a self-consistent model that unifies these processes by linking shock heating and angular momentum deposition through the entropy jumps across the spiral shocks. We show that this model accurately reproduces the temperature and surface density profiles around the planet's orbit, as obtained from two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with standard $\alpha$ viscosity and $\beta$ thermal relaxation prescriptions. Furthermore, by incorporating an empirically derived scaling law for the radial distribution of the entropy jump, we construct a fully analytic model that self-consistently predicts the temperature and surface density structures of disks hosting a giant planet.

We aim at testing out Pn in an astrophysical setting and compare it to M1, in order to see if it can indeed correct M1's flaws. Also, we want to use Pn's solutions to better pinpoint M1 errors. We implement a Pn radiation transport method and couple it to a photo-thermo-chemistry module to account for the interaction of ionising radiation with the Hydrogen gas, and benchmark it using tests for radiative transfer models comparison in astrophysics as defined in arXiv:astro-ph/0603199 . We find that high order P_n (e.g. P9) indeed correct M1's flaws, while faring as well or even better in some aspects in the tests, in particular when directionality is important or colliding radiation fronts occur. By comparing P9 and M1 radiation fields in an idealised and cosmological test case, we highlight a new, thus far unreported artefact of M_1, the 'dark sombrero'. A dark sombrero appears as a spherical photon-deficit shell around the source. The photon density in dark sombreros can be underestimated by a factor up to 2-3. They occur in regions where a source's radiation field connects with that of another source or group of sources. These basic properties (position and amplitude) of the dark sombreros may depend on the sources' relative intensities, positions, spatial resolution, although we have not been able to test this in detail in this study.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth-Mass Planets in Tandem Disks</a><span class="id">[2508.13269]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents a new terrestrial planet formation theory demonstrating that Earth-mass planets form naturally in tandem protosolar disks.

In a tandem proto-solar disk, planets form at two distinct locations: the inner and outer edges of the MRI-suppressed region, where solid particles accumulate. The inner edge produces rocky planets, while the outer edge forms gas giants. When planetesimals reach Earth-sized mass at the inner MRI edge, they migrate outward due to gas disk torque. For a protosolar disk accretion rate of M_dot = 10^-7.08 solar masses per year (Case D), the total solid mass at the inner MRI edge reaches 1.99 Earth masses, producing two Earth-mass planets. This result closely matches the solar system's terrestrial planet distribution (Earth and Venus), which comprises 92% of total terrestrial planet mass, providing strong support for our formation mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Targeted Searches for Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</a><span class="id">[2508.16534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first targeted searches for continuous gravitational waves (CWs) from 114 active galactic nuclei (AGN) that may host supermassive black hole binaries, using the NANOGrav 15 yr data set.

Bayesian comparisons against a model including only a Hellings-Downs correlated background disfavors a CW signal for all targets, with a mean Bayes factor of $0.73 \pm 0.32$. Two targets have Bayes factors slightly above unity, but coherence tests, random targeting experiments, and a conservative accounting of the 114-target trials factor all indicate that they are consistent with noise. We use these two candidates as worked examples to illustrate an end-to-end targeted CW search analysis and a suite of follow up tests that future promising candidates would need to pass.

In this context, we investigate the dynamics of this reversing mean flow by modelling a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core in polar geometry.

In this work, we investigate the unusual architecture of the VHS J125601.92-125723.9 system, where a retrograde, nearly polar tertiary orbits an extremely low-mass substellar binary in a hierarchical triple configuration. We find that triple body dynamics can naturally reproduce the observed high eccentricity of the inner binary and the tertiary's near-polar obliquity. However, this configuration alone cannot account for the observed mutual inclination, which is both near-polar and retrograde. This tension suggests two possible formation pathways: either the planet formed in an aligned, protoplanetary disk-like configuration and was later tilted by an additional, undetected fourth companion (below current Gaia limits), or the system formed close to its current state. Stellar flybys, in contrast, are unlikely due to their long timescales.

Within the context of an automated search for X-ray sources showing flux variability in the \textit{Chandra} archive, we identified peculiar variability patterns in 2MASX J12571076+2724177 (J1257), a SMBH in the Coma cluster, during observations performed in 2020. We investigated the long-term evolution of the flux, together with the evolution of the spectral parameters throughout the \textit{Chandra} and \textit{XMM-Newton} observations, which cover a time span of approximately 20 years. We found that J1257 has repeatedly shown peculiar variability over the last 20 years, on typical timescales of $\simeq20-30$ ks. From our spectral analysis, we found hints of a softer-when-brighter behaviour and of two well-separated flux states. We suggest that J1257 might represent a new addition to the ever-growing size of relatively low mass SMBHs ($M\simeq10^6-10^7\mathrm{M}_\odot$) showing extreme, possibly quasi-periodic X-ray variability on short time scales. The available dataset does not allow for a definitive classification of the nature of the variability. However, given the observed properties, it could either represent a quasi-periodic oscillation at particularly low frequency or be associated with quasi-periodic eruptions in an AGN with peculiar spectral properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Closed-Form Analytical Theory of Non-Isobaric Transmission Spectroscopy for Exoplanet Atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2511.07656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analytical models are essential for building physical intuition and guiding the interpretation of exoplanet observations by clarifying the dependencies that shape atmospheric signatures. We present a generalization of the classical isothermal, isobaric transmission model by allowing the opacity to vary with pressure as a power law, $\kappa \propto P^{n}$, and explicitly defining the reference opacity $\kappa_{0}$ at a chosen pressure $P_{0}$. By treating the slant optical depth as an Abel transform of the radial absorption coefficient, we derive a closed-form expression for the effective transit radius in a hydrostatic, isothermal atmosphere with pressure-dependent opacity. The solution provides a compact framework for exploring non-isobaric effects and explicitly links the vertical opacity gradient to observable spectral features. We benchmark the model against empirical transmission spectra of Earth and the hot Jupiter WASP-39b, finding a significantly improved fit relative to the isobaric formula. This generalized expression offers a physically interpretable foundation for analyzing high-precision spectra from JWST and upcoming ARIEL observations, and can serve as a basis for semi-analytical retrieval approaches optimized for computational efficiency.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchronisation of a tidal binary by inward orbital migration. The case of Pluto and Charon</a><span class="id">[2511.17832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is usually taken for granted that mutual synchronisation of a tidal two body system is attained through tidal recession, assuming the reduced Hill sphere is not reached. However, synchronisation can be achieved also via tidal approach, provided the Roche limit is not crossed. For each of the two scenarios, we derive the condition under which the evolving synchronicity radius catches up with the tidally evolving orbit. We consider the two scenarios for the Pluto Charon system and examine the impact origin hypothesis of Charons formation against capture. Based on geophysical evidence, we propose that capture appears more likely. Motivated by this conclusion, we investigate the capture scenario, wherein the orbital evolution of Charon starts at a higher altitude than present and undergoes tidal descent, both analytically and numerically. We also consider the possibility that Plutos initial prograde spin underwent a reversal by a tidally approaching retrograde Charon. Depending on the initial conditions, we observe temporary locking of Charon into higher spin orbit resonances 3:2 to 7:2 during the first 0.5 Myr of the systems evolution. Owing to a greater initial separation between the partners, the power dissipated in each of them turns out to be much lower than in the case of tidal recession of bodies of the same internal structure. The greater initial separation also results in lower tidal stress, which may explain the absence of tidally generated fracture patterns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GAPS programme at TNG LXX. HD 128717 B/Gaia-6 B: a long-period eccentric low-mass brown dwarf from astrometry and radial velocities</a><span class="id">[2512.04606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The transition regime between giant planets (GPs) and brown dwarfs (BDs) is still an open subject of study in exoplanetary science. A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\text{B} = 19.8 \pm 0.5$ $M_\text{J}$, $e_\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\text{B} = 130^{\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamically consistent analysis of Galactic WN4b stars</a><span class="id">[2601.02498]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars have optically thick winds that cloak the hydrostatic layers of the underlying star. In these cases, traditional spectral analysis methods are plagued by degeneracies that make it difficult to constrain parameters such as the stellar radius and the deeper density and velocity structure of the atmosphere. Focussing on the regime of nitrogen-rich WN4-stars with strong emission lines, we employ hydrodynamically-consistent modelling using the PoWR-HD code branch to perform a next generation spectral analysis. The inherent coupling of the stellar and wind parameters enables us to break parameter degeneracies, constrain the wind structure, and get a mass estimate. With this information, we can draw evolutionary implications and test current mass-loss descriptions for WR stars. We selected a sample of six Galactic WN4b stars. Applying updated parallaxes from Gaia DR3 and calculating PoWR-HD models that sufficiently resemble most of their spectral appearance, we obtain new values for the stellar and wind parameters of the WN4b sample. We compare our results to previous studies employing grid models with a beta = 1 velocity structure and cross-check our derived parameters with stellar structure predictions from GENEC and FRANEC evolution tracks. For all six targets, we obtain a narrow range of stellar temperatures T 140 kK, in contrast to previous grid-model analyses. We confirm the existence of WRs with luminosities as low as log L/Lsol = 5.0 and M 5 Msol. All derived velocity fields include a plateau feature at  85% of the terminal velocity. Both the distance updates and the switch to dynamically-consistent atmospheres lead to substantial parameter adjustments compared to earlier grid-based studies. A comparison of the derived mass-loss rates favours a different description for the WN4b sample than for WN2 stars analysed with the same methodology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A binary merger product as the direct progenitor of a Type II-P supernova</a><span class="id">[2601.06577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type II-P supernovae (SNe II-P) are the most common class of core-collapse SNe in the local Universe and play critical roles in many aspects of astrophysics. Since decades ago theorists have predicted that SNe II-P may originate not only from single stars but also from interacting binaries. While  20 SNII-P progenitors have been directly detected on pre-explosion images, observational evidence still remains scarce for this speculated binary progenitor channel. In this work, we report the discovery of a red supergiant progenitor for the Type II-P SN 2018gj. While the progenitor resembles those of other SNe II-P in terms of effective temperature and luminosity, it is located in a very old environment and SN 2018gj has an abnormally short plateau in the light curve. With state-of-the-art binary evolution simulations, we find these characteristics can only be explained if the progenitor of SN 2018gj is the merger product of a close binary system, which developed a different interior structure and evolved over a longer timescale compared with single-star evolution. This work provides the first compelling evidence for the long-sought binary progenitor channel toward SNe II-P, and our methodology serves as an innovative and pragmatic tool to motivate further investigations into this previously hidden population of SNe II-P from binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic jets from millisecond proto-magnetars</a><span class="id">[2601.07918]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapidly rotating, strongly magnetized neutron stars (“millisecond proto-magnetars”) formed in stellar core-collapse, neutron star mergers, and white dwarf accretion-induced collapse have long been proposed as central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) and accompanying supernovae/kilonovae. However, during the first few seconds after birth, neutrino heating drives baryon-rich winds from the neutron star surface, potentially limiting the magnetization and achievable Lorentz factors of the outflow and casting doubt on whether proto-magnetars can launch ultra-relativistic jets at early times, as needed to power short-duration GRB. We present 3D general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of neutrino-heated proto-magnetar winds that incorporate M0 neutrino transport. While the global wind properties broadly agree with previous analytic estimates calibrated to one-dimensional models, our simulations reveal essential multidimensional effects. For rapidly rotating models with spin periods P = 1 ms, centrifugal forces strongly enhance mass loss near the rotational equator, producing a dense, sub-relativistic outflow (  0.1c). This equatorial wind naturally confines and collimates less baryon-loaded outflows emerging from higher latitudes, leading to the formation of a structured bipolar jet with a peak magnetization up to   30-100 along the pole, sufficient to reach bulk Lorentz factors   100 on larger scales. The resulting angular stratification of the outflow energy into ultra-relativistic polar and sub-relativistic equatorial components is broadly consistent with the observed partition between beaming-corrected GRB energies and supernova/kilonova ejecta. Our results demonstrate that millisecond proto-magnetars can launch relativistic jets within seconds of formation and highlight their potential role in powering the diverse electromagnetic counterparts of compact-object explosions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Gravitational Waves from Scalar Backreaction in Axion-SU(2) Inflation</a><span class="id">[2601.08622]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we perform the first numerical study of strong scalar backreaction in spectator chromo-natural inflation (SCNI) in the case where the spectator sector decays during inflation.

The strong scalar backreaction regime introduces an effective quartic term in the potential for the gauge field background that rapidly drives it to zero, accelerating the axion-gauge system decay.

We consider a broad class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes and geometrically thin equatorial accretion disk with a prescribed inner radius and infinite outer extent, viewed by a polar observer. Depending on the inner radius of the disk, the thickness of each photon ring varies, and the rings may or may not overlap. By overlapping, we mean that portions of images appear at the same angular position on the observer's sky. To characterize the overlapping, we introduce the radius of merging - the value of the disk's inner radius at which two photon rings of given orders begin to overlap. Since each radius of merging is labeled by two indices corresponding to the image orders, it becomes possible to arrange these radii in the form of an infinite-dimensional matrix where only the upper right-hand corner is filled. This matrix, which we call the &quot;matrix of merging&quot;, is a signature of spacetime only, and, once known, it provides a qualitative understanding of the overlapping pattern for any chosen value of the inner radius of the disk. Remarkably, the matrix of merging exhibits several universal properties that hold for all spherically symmetric metrics and can be established even without explicit calculation of light trajectories. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that certain overlapping patterns are universally forbidden across all such spacetimes and for any inner radius of the disk. Examples for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström black holes are provided. The main application of our study is constraining the spacetime metric and the accretion model using observed photon ring overlaps.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast and accurate analytical formulas for light propagation in general static, spherically symmetric spacetimes</a><span class="id">[2511.03144]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this article, we extend our previously presented analytical formulas (Phys.Rev.D 109 (2024) 12, 124055) for describing light rays passing near or emitted in the vicinity of compact objects to a broader class of spherically symmetric, static spacetimes, including the Johansen-Psaltis and Rezzolla-Zhidenko metric families.

IMRPhenomXE extends the quasi-circular IMRPhenomXAS waveform model for the dominant $(\ell, |m|) =$ (2,2) modes to eccentric binaries. For the inspiral part, orbit-averaged equations of motion within the quasi-Keplerian parametrization up to third post-Newtonian order, including spin effects, are evolved, and the waveform modes are computed using the stationary phase approximation on eccentricity expanded expressions up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{12})$. The model assumes circularization at merger-ringdown, where it adopts the underlying quasicircular IMRPhenomXAS baseline. We show that IMRPhenomXE reduces to the accurate IMPhenomXAS model in the quasi-circular limit. Compared against 186 public numerical relativity waveforms from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog with initial eccentricities up to $~0.8$, IMRPhenomXE provides values of unfaithfulness below $3\%$ for $72\%$ of simulations with initial eccentricities below 0.4. For larger eccentricities, the unfaithfulness degrades up to $\gtrsim 10\%$ due to the underlying small eccentricity expansions and additional modelling approximations. In terms of speed, IMRPhenomXE outperforms any of the existing inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric waveform models. We demonstrate the efficiency, robustness, and modularity of IMRPhenomXE through injections into zero noise and parameter-estimation analyses of gravitational-wave events, showing that IMRPhenomXE is a ready-to-use waveform model for gravitational-wave astronomy in the era of rapidly growing event catalogs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Topological Origin of Bohm Resistivity in Magnetic Reconnection</a><span class="id">[2601.08054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physical origin of 'anomalous' resistivity in magnetic reconnection remains one of the longest-standing problems in space plasma physics. While the empirical Bohm diffusion scaling ($\eta~\propto~T/B$) is widely invoked to explain fast reconnection rates, it lacks a rigorous derivation from first principles. Here, we derive this scaling by modeling the magnetized electron fluid as an overdamped spintronic condensate governed by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation. We demonstrate that the breakdown of the &quot;frozen-in&quot; condition is rigorously identified as an Adler-Ohmic bifurcation in the model: a topological phase transition where electron gyro-axes lose synchronization with the magnetic field. By rigorously mapping the breakdown of adiabatic invariance to electron gyro axis slippage on the unit sphere, we show that the resulting resistivity naturally saturates at the Bohm limit. Numerical simulations of the $XY$ universality class confirm that the onset of this resistive state is explosive, following a logistic trigger consistent with the impulsive phase of solar flares. Furthermore, the topological defects in the condensate decay via a $t^{-0.75}$ power law, consistent with magnetic island coalescence as the mechanism of anomalous transport. These results suggest that Bohm resistivity is a universal topological property of magnetized matter at the critical point of reconnection.</p></div></details></article></body>
