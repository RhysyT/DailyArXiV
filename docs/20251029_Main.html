Yet, their physical properties often differ from those of true planetary soil, particularly when compared to regolith properties in-situ, that experience notably reduced gravity. We focus on lunar regolith simulants and explore various techniques to modify existing simulants to replicate the mechanical/rheological behavior of Moon regolith in true lunar conditions. Our results are validated against data from in-situ tests conducted during the Luna and Apollo missions, enabling a direct comparison of physical properties of our enhanced simulants to true Lunar regolith, on the Moon. Analyzed in the Mohr-Coulomb model framework, the friction angle of most simulants is generally close to that of true regolith, but the measured cohesion is often higher on the Moon, notably due to the reduced gravity environment. We propose a method to increase the cohesion of an existing simulant and assess the mechanical behavior of our rheological regolith simulant using a standardized geotechnical, shear test. The experimental results are then directly compared to in-situ data, providing a quantitative basis for evaluating the fidelity of the enhanced simulants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shock Acceleration in the Intracluster Medium: Implications of Micromirror Confinement</a><span class="id">[2510.23700]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Merging galaxy clusters exhibit strong observational evidence for efficient particle acceleration in the intracluster medium (ICM), particularly in the form of synchrotron-emitting radio relics and halos. Cosmic ray (CR) electrons are likely accelerated (or re-accelerated) at merger and accretion shocks via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). However, in the presence of the large diffusion coefficients one would naively expect in the rarefied, relatively unmagnetized ICM, this acceleration–in particular, the maximum proton energy ($E_{\rm max}$)–is limited by long acceleration times. On the other hand, recent work on CR transport suggests that the diffusion coefficient can be suppressed in ICM-like environments. In this picture, deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium can trigger the mirror instability, creating plasma-scale magnetic structures, or &quot;micromirrors,&quot; that efficiently scatter CRs. In this paper, we investigate the implications of micromirror confinement for shock acceleration in the ICM. We demonstrate that micromirrors enforce a minimum value of $E_{\rm max} \gtrsim 100$ GeV that does not rely on CR-driven magnetic field amplification. We also discuss micromirror confinement in the context of cosmological simulations and $\gamma$-ray observations, and present a simulation of a Coma-like merging cluster that self-consistently includes CR acceleration at shocks, with an effective diffusion coefficient set by micromirrors. We show that the introduction of micromirrors yields simulated galaxy clusters that remain consistent with $\gamma$-ray observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT2025ulz and S250818k: Leveraging DESI spectroscopy in the hunt for a kilonova associated with a sub-solar mass gravitational wave candidate</a><span class="id">[2510.23723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On August 18th, 2025, the LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA collaboration reported a sub-threshold gravitational wave candidate detection consistent with a sub-solar-mass neutron star merger, denoted S250818k. An optical transient, AT2025ulz, was discovered within the localization region. AT2025ulz initially appeared to meet the expected behavior of kilonova (KN) emission, the telltale signature of a binary neutron star merger. The transient subsequently rebrightened after $\sim$ $5$ days and developed spectral features characteristic of a Type IIb supernova. In this work, we analyze the observations of the host galaxy of AT2025ulz obtained by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). From the DESI spectrum, we obtain a secure redshift of $z = 0.084840 \pm 0.000006$, which places the transient within $2\sigma$ of the gravitational wave distance and results in an integral overlap between the gravitational wave alert and the transient location of $\log_{10}\mathcal{I} \approx 3.9-4.2$. Our analysis of the host galaxy's spectral energy distribution reveals a star-forming, dusty galaxy with stellar mass ${\sim} 10^{10}~M_\odot$, broadly consistent with the population of both short gamma-ray bursts and core-collapse supernova host galaxies. We also present our follow-up of DESI-selected candidate host galaxies using the Fraunhofer Telescope at the Wendelstein Observatory, and show the promise of DESI for associating or rejecting candidate electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave alerts. These results emphasize the value of DESI's extensive spectroscopic dataset in rapidly characterizing host galaxies, enabling spectroscopic host subtraction, and guiding targeted follow-up.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continuous gravitational waves from magnetized white dwarfs: Quantifying the detection plausibility by LISA</a><span class="id">[2510.23724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>White dwarfs (WDs) are frequently observed to have strong magnetic fields up to $10^9$ G and expected to have a possible internal field as high as $\sim 10^{14}$ G. High internal fields can significantly deform a WD's equilibrium structure, generating a quadrupole moment. If the rotation axis is misaligned with the magnetic axis, the deformation can lead to the emission of continuous gravitational waves (CGWs). We examine the potential for detecting CGWs from magnetized WDs with future space-based detectors such as LISA, ALIA, DECIGO, Deci-Hz, BBO and TianQin. We model the field-induced deformation and compute the resulting GW strain, incorporating amplitude decay due to angular momentum loss from electromagnetic and gravitational radiation. This sets a timescale for detection -`active timescale' of $10^{5-6}$ yr, requiring observation while the object remains sufficiently young. Our results suggest that LISA could detect a few dozens of highly magnetized WDs across the Galaxy during its mission. As a specific case, we investigate ZTF J1901+1458- a compact, massive, fast-rotating, and strongly magnetized WD with spin period $\sim416$ s and inferred surface field $\sim10^{9}$ G. We find that this object would be detectable by LISA with four years of continuous data. This highlights the potential of CGW observations to probe magnetic field structure in WDs and their role in type Ia supernova progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT2025ulz and S250818k: Deep X-ray and radio limits on off-axis afterglow emission and prospects for future discovery</a><span class="id">[2510.23728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The first joint electromagentic (EM) and gravitational wave (GW) detection, known as GW170817, marked a critical juncture in our collective understanding of compact object mergers. However, it has now been 8 years since this discovery, and the search for a second EM-GW detection has yielded no robust discoveries. Recently, on August 18, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration reported a low-significance (high false alarm rate) binary neutron star merger candidate S250818k. Rapid optical follow-up revealed a single optical candidate AT2025ulz ($z=0.08484$) that initially appeared consistent with kilonova emission. We quickly initiated a set of observations with \textit{Swift}, \textit{XMM-Newton}, \textit{Chandra}, and the Very Large Array to search for non-thermal afterglow emission. Our deep X-ray and radio search rules out that the optical rebrightening of AT2025ulz is related to the afterglow onset, reinforcing its classification as a stripped-envelope supernova (SN 2025ulz). We derive constraints on the afterglow parameters for a hypothetical binary neutron star merger at the distance of AT2025ulz ($\approx 400$ Mpc) based on our X-ray and radio limits. We conclude that our observational campaign could exclude a GW170817-like afterglow out to viewing angles of $\theta_\textrm{v}\approx 12.5$ degrees. We briefly discuss the prospects for the future discovery of off-axis afterglows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrodynamic Simulations of Tidal Disruption Encores</a><span class="id">[2510.23729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO of Tidal Disruption Encores (TDEEs) in nuclear star clusters (NSCs). TDEEs arise when a stellar-mass black hole (sBH) disrupts a star within the NSC, producing debris that is unbound from the sBH but remains gravitationally bound to the central massive black hole (MBH), leading to a delayed secondary flare. We find that the morphology and thermodynamics of the fallback material depend sensitively on the disruption geometry, MBH mass, and sBH-MBH separation. We identify two distinct morphological outcomes: ring encores, where debris circularize into a torus, and direct encores, where streams plunge toward the MBH, with encore luminosities peaking at times corresponding to the freefall timescale and one orbital period, respectively. Across all simulated cases, we find these events exhibit luminosities of $10^{40}-10^{42}$ erg/s with lightcurves characteristic of their morphology. Our work greatly improves the predictions of TDEE lightcurves and empowers observations to probe into NSC dynamics and sBH population while providing possible explanations for anomalous TDE-like flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unlocking the radio-gamma spectrum of the pulsar wind nebula around PSR J1124-5916 in SNR G292.0+1.8</a><span class="id">[2510.23747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first detection of GeV $\gamma$-ray emission potentially associated with the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) hosted by the young core-collapse supernova remnant G292.0+1.8, based on a detailed time-resolved analysis of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data. By isolating the unpulsed component from the dominant magnetospheric radiation of PSR J1124$-$5916, we successfully disentangle a candidate nebular emission in the GeV range, characterise its morphology and extract its spectrum. This identification places G292.0+1.8 among the few systems in which the pulsar and PWN contributions have been spectrally resolved at high energies, offering new insight into their respective emission mechanisms. We characterise the $\gamma$-ray spectrum of the pulsar and model the broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) of the PWN using radio, X-ray, and GeV data. The emission is well described by a single electron population with two spectral breaks: one intrinsic to the injection spectrum and another produced by synchrotron cooling in a magnetic field of $\sim$15 $\mu$G. Notably, the inferred magnetic field and the low TeV flux of the nebula resemble those of 3C 58, suggesting that similar low-field environments can arise in young PWNe. The high-energy portion of the SED is now tightly constrained by our GeV detection and existing TeV upper limits. Compared to our model, earlier predictions tend to underpredict the $\gamma$-ray flux, while others that succeed in reproducing the GeV component often overpredict the TeV emission. This mismatch underscores the challenges in modelling particle acceleration and radiation processes in young PWNe and establishes G292.0+1.8 as a valuable benchmark for testing and refining such models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23750" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Study of Neutron Star Properties under the Two-Flavor Quark NJL Model</a><span class="id">[2510.23750]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Equation of State (EOS) of matter within neutron stars is a central topic in nuclear physics and astrophysics. A precise understanding of the composition and phase behavior of matter under such extreme conditions is crucial for uncovering the fundamental laws of the strong interaction. This study investigates hadron-quark hybrid stars using a two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. As an effective theory, this model can describe the generation of dynamical quark masses and chiral symmetry restoration characteristic of dense quark matter. We construct the hybrid EOS by joining the BSR6 relativistic mean-field model for hadronic matter with the NJL model for quark matter. A quintic polynomial interpolation ensures a smooth ($C^2$ continuity) and thermodynamically consistent crossover between the phases. Based on this hybrid EOS, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations to calculate macroscopic properties of neutron stars, such as the mass-radius ($M-R$) relationship and the tidal deformability parameter ($\Lambda$). By exploring key model parameters, we identify a region satisfying a wide range of multi-messenger constraints. Our resulting EOS supports a maximum mass consistent with PSR J0740+6620, while simultaneously predicting radii and tidal deformabilities for a $1.4M_{\odot}$ star that agree with NICER observations and limits from GW170817. This work thus presents a self-consistent model that resolves the tension between high-mass pulsars and small tidal deformabilities, deepening our understanding of the hadron-quark crossover.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clustering properties of the CatWISE2020 quasar catalogue and their impact on the cosmic dipole anomaly</a><span class="id">[2510.23769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic dipole anomaly – the observation of a significant mismatch between the dipole observed in the matter distribution and that expected given the kinematic interpretation of the cosmic microwave background dipole – poses a serious challenge to the Cosmological Principle upon which the standard model of cosmology rests. Measurements of the dipole ($\ell=1$) in a given sample crucially depend on having control over other large-scale power ($\ell &gt; 1$) so as to avoid biases, in particular those potentially caused by correlations among multipoles during fitting, and those by local source clustering. Currently, the most powerful catalogue that exhibits the cosmic dipole anomaly is the sample of 1.6 million mid-infrared quasars derived from CatWISE2020. We therefore analyse clustering properties of this catalogue by performing an inference analysis of large-scale multipoles in real space, and by computing its angular power spectrum on small scales to test for convergence with $\Lambda$CDM. After accounting for the known trend of the quasar number counts with ecliptic latitude, we find that any other large-scale power is consistent with noise, find no evidence for the presence of an octupole ($\ell=3$) in the data, and quantify the clustering dipole's proportion to be marginal. Our results therefore reaffirm the anomalously high dipole in the distribution of quasars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unsupervised learning for variability detection with Gaia DR3 photometry. The main sequence-white dwarf valley</a><span class="id">[2510.23776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The unprecedented volume and quality of data from space- and ground-based telescopes present an opportunity for machine learning to identify new classes of variable stars and peculiar systems that may have been overlooked by traditional methods. Extending prior methodological work, this study investigates the potential of an unsupervised learning approach to scale effectively to larger stellar populations, including objects in crowded fields, and without the need for pre-selected catalogues, specifically focusing on 13 405 sources selected from Gaia DR3 and lying in the selected region of the CMD. Our methodology incorporates unsupervised clustering techniques based primarily on statistical features extracted from Gaia DR3 epoch photometry. We used the t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding (t-SNE) algorithm to identify variability classes, their subtypes, and spurious variability induced by instrumental effects. The clustering results revealed distinct groups, including hot subdwarfs, cataclysmic variables (CVs), eclipsing binaries, and objects in crowded fields, such as those in the Andromeda (M31) field. Several potential stellar subtypes also emerged within these clusters. Notably, objects previously labelled as RR Lyrae were found in an unexpected region of the CMD, potentially due to either unreliable astrometric measurements (e.g., due to binarity) or alternative evolutionary pathways. This study emphasises the robustness of the proposed method in finding variable objects in a large region of the Gaia CMD, including variable hot subdwarfs and CVs, while demonstrating its efficiency in detecting variability in extended stellar populations. The proposed unsupervised learning framework demonstrates scalability to large datasets and yields promising results in identifying stellar subclasses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dynamical Environment within the Habitable Zone of the Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 Planetary Systems</a><span class="id">[2510.23792]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exoplanetary systems exhibit a broad range of architectures which, in turn, enable a variety of dynamical environments. Many of the known planetary systems do not transit the host star, and so we measure the minimum masses of their planets, making it difficult to fully assess the dynamical environment within the system. Astrometry can resolve the mass ambiguity and thus allow a more complete dynamical analysis of systems to be conducted. Gaia-4 and Gaia-5 are two such systems, whose study with radial velocities and data from the Gaia mission revealed that each star harbors a massive planet on a highly eccentric orbit. In this work, we provide the results of a dynamical analysis of each system, including calculations of the Habitable Zone (HZ), from which we show that the presence of the known companions largely exclude the presence of planets within the HZ. We discuss the diagnostics of potential past planet-planet scattering events, and the occurrence of similar systems whereby a giant planet on an eccentric orbit can substantially disrupt orbital integrity of terrestrial planets. These &quot;wrecking ball&quot; systems have an impact on the target selection for planned direct imaging missions that seek to identify potentially habitable environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Local Distance Network: a community consensus report on the measurement of the Hubble constant at 1% precision</a><span class="id">[2510.23823]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The direct, empirical determination of the local value of the Hubble constant (H0) has markedly advanced thanks to improved instrumentation, measurement techniques, and distance estimators. However, combining determinations from different estimators is non-trivial, due to correlated calibrations and different analysis methodologies. Using covariance weighting and leveraging the broad and comprehensive community of experts, we constructed a rigorous and transparent Distance Network (DN) to find a consensus value and uncertainty for the local H0. All critically reviewed the available data sets, spanning parallaxes, detached eclipsing binaries, masers, Cepheids, the TRGB, Miras, JAGB stars, SN Ia, Surface Brightness Fluctuations, SN II, the Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher relations and voted for indicators to define a `baseline' DN and others to assess robustness and sensitivity of the results. We provide open-source software and data products to support full transparency and future extensions of this effort. Our conclusions: 1) Local H0 is robustly determined, with first-rank indicators internally consistent within their uncertainties; 2) A covariance-weighted combination yields an uncertainty of 1.1% (baseline) or 0.9% (all estimators); 3) The contribution from SNe Ia is consistent across four current compilations of optical magnitudes or using NIR-only magnitudes; 4) Removing either Cepheids or TRGB has minimal effect; 5) Replacing SNe Ia with galaxy-based indicators changes H0 by less than 0.1 km/s/Mpc, while doubling its uncertainty; 6) The baseline result is H0=73.50+/-0.81 km/s/Mpc. Compared to early Universe results, our result differs by 7.1sigma from flat {\Lambda}CDM with Planck+SPT+ACT and 5.0 sigma with BBN+BAO (DESI2). A networked approach is invaluable for enabling further progress in accuracy and precision without overreliance on any single method, sample or group.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Trends in Astrophysical Self-Organized Criticality</a><span class="id">[2510.23825]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This review is focused on recent {\sl Self-Organized Criticality (SOC)} literature of astrophysical phenomena, covering the last decade of (2015-2025), while previous SOC literature (1987-2014) is reviewed elsewhere.

By applying criteria that the binary-lens events exhibit well-resolved caustics, short time scales ($t_{\rm E} \lesssim 9$ days), and have small angular Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} \lesssim 0.17$ mas), we identify six candidate binary BD events: MOA-2023-BLG-331, KMT-2023-BLG-2019, KMT-2024-BLG-1005, KMT-2024-BLG-1518, MOA-2024-BLG-181, and KMT-2024-BLG-2486. Analysis of these events leads to models that provide precise estimates for both lensing observables, $t_{\rm E}$ and $\theta_{\rm E}$. We estimate the masses of the binary components through Bayesian analysis, utilizing the constraints from $t_{\rm E}$ and $\theta_{\rm E}$. The results show that for the events KMT-2024-BLG-1005, KMT-2024-BLG-1518, MOA-2024-BLG-181, and KMT-2024-BLG-2486, the probability that both binary components lie within the BD mass range exceeds 50\%, indicating a high likelihood that the lenses of these events are binary BDs. In contrast, for MOA-2023-BLG-331L and KMT-2023-BLG-2019L, the probabilities that the lower-mass components of the binary lenses lie within the BD mass range exceed 50\%, while the probabilities for the heavier components are below 50\%, suggesting that these systems are more likely to consist of a low-mass M dwarf and a BD. The brown-dwarf nature of the binary candidates can ultimately be confirmed by combining the measured lens-source relative proper motions with high-resolution imaging taken at a later time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23945" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Evolution of Gamma Ray Bursts</a><span class="id">[2510.23945]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are classified as long (LGRBs) and short (SGRBs) with collapsars and compact object mergers (neutron star (NS)-NS or NS-Black hole) as progenitors, respectively. The former are expected to follow the cosmic star formation rate (SFR), while the latter follows a delayed version of the SFR. However, this division has come under question in several ways, the most prominent being the observational evidence of a significant excess of LGRBs at low redhifts by several independent investigations, summarized in arXiv:2305.15081 . This could indicate that the progenitors of low-redshift LGRBs, whose formation rates are delayed, (similar to that of SGRBs) are compact mergers rather than collapsars. Two recent observations of low-redshift LGRBs show associations with kilonovae, a clear feature of compact mergers. Most results showing this separation are based on analyses of small (less than 200) samples of LGRBs with measured redshifts. The aim of this paper is to use a larger sample of LGRBs. The number of LGRBs with measured redshifts has increased by more than a factor of 2 over the last decade. To this data set we add a sample of LGRBs whose redshifts are estimated using a machine learning (ML) method ( arXiv:2410.13985 ). This, in addition to increasing the sample size, reduces the observational selection bias arising from the process of redshift measurement. To account for this bias, we use the non-parametric, non-binning Efron-Petrosian method to establish the degree of correlation between luminosity and redshift, the luminosity evolution, which then allows us to use the Lynden-Bell $C^-$ method to obtain a complete description of the luminosity function. We find similar low redshift excess for the larger sample with measured redshifts. Adding the sources with ML-estimated redshifts, which tend to have more sources in mid-range redshifts, the excess is reduced.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eclipsed X-ray Bursts from Magnetar SGR J1935+2154 and the Fireball Measurements</a><span class="id">[2510.24075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray bursts from the magnetar can lead to the formation of fireballs trapped by the magnetic field and co-rotating with the star. The fireball emission could occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we discover a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154. Based on these bursts, we identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\circ \pm 10^\circ$. The distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than five times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. We also find this configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature in their spectra. Our results suggest that some intermediate X-ray bursts of SGR 1935+2154 may originate from magnetic reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Evidence for a Dynamically Evolving Dark Energy Scenario: Tomographic Alcock-Paczyński Test with Redshift-Space Correlation Function II</a><span class="id">[2510.24089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We apply an extended Alcock-Paczyński (AP) test to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy models with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state. The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\Omega_m=0.289_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$, $w_0=-0.798_{-0.102}^{+0.192}$ and $w_a=-0.165_{-0.945}^{+0.610}$. The result does not show evidence for a dynamically evolving dark energy model. When combined with other results from the low-redshift universe, such as the PantheonPlus supernova compilation and DESI BAO data, the constraint on $w_a$ becomes $w_a=-0.124_{-0.368}^{+0.334}$, which is still consistent with zero.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decadal brightening in the northeastern non-thermal filament of Cassiopeia A</a><span class="id">[2510.24123]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the decadal brightening of non-thermal emission flux in the northeastern filament of the young supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A), which highlights dynamic processes in the forward shock. This filament, characterized by the highest particle acceleration rate among Cas A's outer shells, offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate underlying astrophysical mechanisms. Since 2000, the non-thermal flux has increased by several tens of percent before plateauing, while the spectral shape has remained largely unchanged. Over the past two decades, the filament's morphology has evolved significantly, splitting into two distinct sections. Detailed analysis reveals contrasting behaviors: one section shows a flux increase followed by saturation, while the other maintains a steady flux. These differences likely arise from nonlinear effects, including magnetohydrodynamic interactions influenced by magnetic field orientation, interactions with surrounding material, and complex fluid dynamics associated with young supernova remnants. The localized evolution of this filament, captured with high spatial resolution, provides critical insights into the temporal dynamics of non-thermal particles and the generation of cosmic rays from asymmetric supernova explosions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiatively-Cooled Mass Transfer: Disk Properties and L2 outflows across Mass Transfer Rates</a><span class="id">[2510.24127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High rates of stable mass transfer (MT) occur for some binary star systems, resulting in luminous transients and circumbinary outflows.

By varying the orbital separation of the system, we probe MT rates between $10^{-5}$ and $10^{-1} M_\odot$/yr. Mass flows from the donor into an accretion disk, with significant equatorially-concentrated outflows through the outer Lagrange point L2 occurring for MT rates $\gtrsim 10^{-3} M_\odot$/yr, while the MT remaining mostly conservative for lower MT rates. In all cases, any outflowing gas approximately carries the specific angular momentum of L2. The gas cooling luminosity $L$ and temperature increases with MT rate, with $L \sim 10^{5} L_\odot$ and $T \sim 10^4 \, {\rm K}$ for simulations featuring the strongest outflows, with contributions from both the accretion disk and circumbinary outflow.

Their thermal and luminosity evolution reflects key internal properties such as the equation of state (EoS), nucleon superfluidity and superconductivity, envelope composition, and magnetic field, and so on. Recent observations [\textit{e.g.}, V. Abramkin \textit{et al.,} ApJ \textbf{924}, 128 (2022)] have revealed unexpectedly warm old neutron stars, which cannot be explained by standard neutrino-photon cooling models. The failure of the standard cooling models implies the presence of additional internal heating mechanism. Building on the previous study [M. Fujiwara \textit{et al}., JCAP \textbf{03}, 051 (2024)], which proposed vortex creep heating (VCH) from the frictional motion of superfluid vortices as a viable mechanism, we extend the cooling framework to include both VCH and direct Urca (DUrca) processes. These are implemented in our code to explore their combined impact, particularly for massive neutron stars where DUrca operates. By varying rotational parameters ($P$, $\dot{P}$, $P_0$), EoS models (APR, BSk24), pairing gaps, and envelope compositions, we examine how heating-cooling interplay shapes the temperature evolution. Our results show that VCH can substantially mitigate the rapid cooling driven by DUrca, offering new evolutionary pathways for massive neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bistability, Oscillations, and Multistability on Hycean Planets</a><span class="id">[2510.24224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hycean planets are hypothetical exoplanets characterized by $H_2O$ oceans and $H_2$-rich atmospheres. These planets are high-priority targets for biosignature searches, as they combine abundant surface liquid water with easy-to-characterize $H_2$-rich atmospheres. Perhaps their most unusual climate feature is convective inhibition, which can dramatically alter a planet's temperature structure. However, so far hycean planets have mostly been investigated using 1D models that do not account for convective inhibition, and its effects are still poorly understood. This work develops pen-and-paper theory to analyze the effects of moist convective inhibition on hycean planets. The theory is tested and verified against a 1D radiative-convective model. We show that hycean planets near the onset of convective inhibition can exhibit either bistability or oscillations, due to the inhibition layer's trapping of heat and moisture. Meanwhile, hot hycean planets exhibit multistability, in which the inhibition layer and surface climate show multiple stable equilibria due to the lack of constraints on the water cycle inside the inhibition layer. The water cycle inside the inhibition layer is influenced by numerous processes that are challenging to resolve in 1D, including turbulent diffusion, convective overshoot and large-scale circulations. Our results demonstrate that hycean planets have unexpectedly rich climate dynamics. Meanwhile, previous claims about hycean planets should be treated with caution until confirmed with more self-consistent 1D and 3D models; this includes the claim that K2-18b might be habitable, and the proposal to infer $H_2O$ oceans on sub-Neptunes from JWST measurements of chemical species in their upper atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha Core-Beam Origin in Low-$β$ Solar Wind Plasma: Insights from Fully Kinetic Simulation</a><span class="id">[2510.24274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In-situ observations of the fast solar wind in the inner-heliosphere show that minor ions and ion sub-populations often exhibit distinct drift velocities.

We aim to propose a mechanism that generates an alpha-particle beam through non-linear Landau damping, primarily driven by the relative super-Alfvénic drift between protons and alpha particles. To investigate this process, we perform one-dimensional, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of a non-equilibrium multi-species plasma, complemented by its linear theory to validate the model during the linear phase.

Four key observational constraints anchor the discussion: (i) a roughly 30 percent occurrence rate in semi-regular variable AGB stars (SRVs), with a much lower rate or absence in regularly pulsating Mira-type AGB stars (Miras), (ii) about 50 percent of LSP stars show a secondary mid-infrared minimum, (iii) Keplerian fits to radial-velocity curves favor argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees, and (iv) the radial-velocity to light-curve phase lag clusters around minus 90 degrees. We test whether a close-in, eccentric, low-mass companion that spends only part of its orbit within the giant's dust-formation zone can match all four empirical constraints. Guided by observed radial-velocity amplitudes and periods of about 500 to 1500 days, we adopt companion masses of 0.08 to 0.25 solar masses, orbital separations of 1.5 to 3 AU, eccentricities up to 0.6, and dust condensation radii of about 2.5 to 3 AU for SRVs (larger for Miras via scaling with luminosity). We compute the fraction of the orbit spent outside the condensation radius and apply line-of-sight criteria for detectability. We test the first three empirical constraints analytically, then model the phase offset using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Our scenario explains the observed excess of systems with argument of periastron greater than 180 degrees and yields LSP detectability of about 27 percent for SRVs and about 2.5 percent for Miras, with a conditional secondary mid-infrared eclipse fraction of about 44 percent. The hydrodynamical models place the optical-depth maximum downstream of the companion near apastron and then shift it forward by roughly 90 to 225 degrees later in the orbit, consistent with the observed radial-velocity to light-curve offsets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM High-resolution Spectroscopy of SS 433: Evidence of Decreasing Line-of-Sight Velocity Dispersion along the Jet</a><span class="id">[2510.24341]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on the jet structure in SS 433 based on X-ray high resolution spectroscopy with the XRISM/Resolve. The source was observed over 5 days covering both inside and outside an eclipse of the compact object by the companion star. Doppler-shifted, ionized Fe and Ni K emission lines were resolved, as well as lower-energy lines including Si and S K lines. Time-resolved spectral analysis showed that Fe and Ni K line widths were $1020 \pm 40$ km s$^{-1}$ (corresponding the 1$\sigma$ width) in the eclipse phase, gradually increased during the egress, and reached $1740 \pm 30$ km s$^{-1}$ outside the eclipse. A time-averaged spectrum outside the eclipse confirmed that the Fe and Ni K lines in 5.5-9 keV are significantly broader than the Si and S K$\alpha$ emission lines in 2–4 keV. Specifically, the width in 5.5-9 keV was measured to be $1900 \pm 80$ km s$^{-1}$, whereas the width in 2-4 keV is $1300^{+300}_{-400}$ km s$^{-1}$ for the approaching (blueshifted) jet component. These results indicate that radial velocity dispersion of the jet plasma in SS 433 decreases as it moves outward. We interpret this variation as progressive jet collimation along its axis, as suggested by Namiki et al. (2003), or a decrease in turbulence in the jet plasma flow within the X-ray emitting region. We also detected a clear difference in velocity dispersion between the approaching and receding (redshifted) jet components in the 5.5-9 keV band outside eclipse. The receding jet exhibited a smaller velocity dispersion ($1400 \pm 200$ km s$^{-1}$) than the approaching jet. Since the observation was conducted when the approaching jet was tilted toward the observer, this may suggest that the receding jet was more extensively occulted by the accretion disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsation Mode Identification and Classification of 46 High-Amplitude $δ$ Scuti Stars from 50 Candidates with TESS observations</a><span class="id">[2510.24444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asteroseismic modelling of high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti (HADS) variables critically depends on their accurate classification, which provides robust constraints on stellar physical parameters. As a foundational step in this direction, we present a detailed analysis of the pulsational behavior of 50 HADS star candidates using high-precision photometric data from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). We confirm 46 as genuine HADS variables, with 40 stars having their dominant frequencies identified for the first time. Among them, 7 pulsate solely in the fundamental mode; 21 exhibit the fundamental mode alongside at least one low-amplitude nonradial mode; 5 are pure double-mode pulsators (the fundamental and first-overtone modes), 13 show double-mode pulsations accompanied by additional low-amplitude nonradial modes. The remaining four stars are classified as other types of variables: two (TIC 69546708 and TIC 110937533) are confirmed hot subdwarfs, one (TIC 8765832) is a cataclysmic variable, and one (TIC 32302937) is a likely hot subluminous star, but it requires further spectroscopic confirmation. We investigate the period-luminosity (PL) relation, also known as the Leavitt law, for these 46 confirmed HADS stars, deriving a revised relation: $M_{V}= (-3.31 \pm0.39)~\mathrm{log}~P+(-1.68 \pm 0.39)$. This result is consistent with previous studies. Their distribution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram indicates that HADS stars are not strictly confined to be within a narrow instability strip previously found, but can extend beyond it, with a distribution toward lower temperatures. The refined classifications presented here establish a high-quality sample for precise asteroseismic modelling and enhance the potential for future machine-learning-assisted searches and classifications of HADS stars in large-scale photometric surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-messenger constraints on transient accelerators of ultra-high energy cosmic rays</a><span class="id">[2510.24516]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) remains an open questions in astrophysics. We explore two primary scenarios for the distribution of UHECR sources, assuming that their production rate follows either the cosmic star-formation-rate or stellar-mass density. By jointly fitting the UHECR energy spectrum and mass composition measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory above the ankle (10^{18.7} eV), we derive constraints on the acceleration mechanisms, source energetics, and elemental abundances at escape. Using these constraints, we generate sky maps above 40 EeV based on a catalog of over 400,000 galaxies out to 350 Mpc, providing a near-infrared flux-limited sample that maps the two stellar-activity tracers across the full sky. A crucial factor in understanding UHECR propagation is the influence of large-scale cosmic structures, particularly galaxy clusters, the largest gravitationally bound systems in the Universe, which are filled with magnetized diffuse plasma. Intermittent sources hosted in galaxies within such structures, coupled with cosmic magnetic fields, shape the observed UHECR arrival directions and provide insights into the burst rate of the sources. We show that these environments can significantly impact UHECR transport, making them particularly opaque to heavy nuclei. Additionally, we compute the expected secondary neutrino and photon fluxes from UHECR interactions in these environments and compare them with current experimental limits, constraining the maximum energy that particles can achieve. Finally, we assess the compatibility of these constraints with astrophysical candidates, identifying long gamma-ray bursts as the most promising sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24560" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM constraints on unidentified X-ray emission lines, including the 3.5 keV line, in the stacked spectrum of ten galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2510.24560]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We stack 3.75 Megaseconds of early XRISM Resolve observations of ten galaxy clusters to search for unidentified spectral lines in the $E=$ 2.5-15 keV band (rest frame), including the $E=3.5$ keV line reported in earlier, low spectral resolution studies of cluster samples.

UV radiation, in particular, plays a key role in stratospheric chemistry and the dynamics of stratospheric ozone.

Continued monitoring beyond this window reveals a rise and color evolution incompatible with kilonova models and instead consistent with a supernova.

Around Neptune- and Earth-like planets, we find that ring-moon cycles are capable of producing long-lived rings of comparable and greater relative transit depths than Saturn's. In multi-planet systems, secular spin-orbit resonances can provide the necessary planetary obliquity for these rings to contribute noticeably to transit lightcurves. We model the geometry of a ring's cross-section at various angles in comparison to the cross-section of a transiting planet to determine whether the ring may be detectable during the planet's transit. Ringed planets have also been proposed as an alternative to inflated planetary radii seen in transit, leading to abnormally low observed densities. Ring-moon cycles can produce late-forming and sometimes long-lived rings that can have the potential of explaining at least some of these observations.

This comprehensive dataset should yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we explore its potential to address the Hubble tension by forecasting constraints from temperature, polarization, and CMB lensing on Early Dark Energy (EDE) and the variation in electron mass in spatially flat and curved universes. For this purpose, we investigate first whether analyzing the distinct SPT-3G observation fields independently, as opposed to as a single, unified region, results in a loss of information relevant to cosmological parameter estimation. We develop a realistic temperature and polarization likelihood pipeline capable of analyzing these fields in these two ways, and subsequently forecast constraints on cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that any loss of constraining power from analyzing the fields separately is primarily concentrated at low multipoles ($\ell$ &lt; 50) and the overall impact on the relative uncertainty on standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters is minimal (&lt; 3%). Our forecasts suggest that SPT-3G data should improve by more than a factor of 200 and 3000 the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the EDE and the varying electron mass models, respectively, when combined with Planck data.

This simplification is motivated by theoretical modeling of spreading late time TDE disks, which often predicts slow light curve evolution. However, if time evolution can be detected, late-time light curves will yield more information than has been previously accessible. In this work, we re-examine late-time TDE data to test how well the flat plateau assumption holds. We use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate the maximum likelihood for a family of theory-agnostic models and apply the Akaike information criterion to find that that roughly one third of our sample favors evolving plateaus, one third favors truly flat plateaus, and one third shows no statistically significant evidence for any plateau. Next, we refit the TDEs that exhibit statistically significant plateaus using a magnetically elevated $\alpha$-disk model, motivated by the lack of clear thermal instability in late time TDE light curves. From these model-dependent fits, we obtain estimates for the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass, the mass of the disrupted star, and the $\alpha$ parameter itself. Fitted $\alpha$ values range from $10^{-3}$ to 0.4 (the mean fitted $\alpha=10^{-1.8}$, with scatter of 0.6 dex), broadly consistent with results from magnetohydrodynamic simulations. Finally, we estimate the timescales of disk precession in magnetically elevated TDE models. Theoretically, we find that disk precession times may be orders of magnitude shorter than in unmagnetized Shakura-Sunyaev disks, and grow in time as $T_{\rm prec}\propto t^{35/36}$; empirically, by using fitted $\alpha$ parameters, we estimate that late time disks may experience $\sim$few-10 precession cycles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Horizontal and vertical exoplanet thermal structure from a JWST spectroscopic eclipse map</a><span class="id">[2510.24708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Highly-irradiated giant exoplanets known as &quot;ultra-hot Jupiters&quot; are anticipated to exhibit large variations of atmospheric temperature and chemistry as a function of longitude, latitude, and altitude. Previous observations have hinted at these variations, but the existing data have been fundamentally restricted to probing hemisphere-integrated spectra, thereby providing only coarse information on atmospheric gradients. Here we present a spectroscopic eclipse map of an extrasolar planet, resolving the atmosphere in multiple dimensions simultaneously. We analyze a secondary eclipse of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-18b observed with the NIRISS instrument on JWST. The mapping reveals weaker longitudinal temperature gradients than were predicted by theoretical models, indicating the importance of hydrogen dissociation and/or nightside clouds in shaping global thermal emission. Additionally, we identify two thermally distinct regions of the planet's atmosphere: a &quot;hotspot&quot; surrounding the substellar point and a &quot;ring&quot; near the dayside limbs. The hotspot region shows a strongly inverted thermal structure due to the presence of optical absorbers and a water abundance marginally lower than the hemispheric average, in accordance with theoretical predictions. The ring region shows colder temperatures and poorly constrained chemical abundances. Similar future analyses will reveal three-dimensional thermal, chemical, and dynamical properties of a broad range of exoplanet atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23686" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surface Binding Energies for Amorphous Plagioclase Feldspar Calculated using Molecular Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2510.23686]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Despite the well-established presence of amorphous compounds on planetary bodies such as the Moon and Mercury due to space weathering, the direct effect of atomic arrangement on the surface binding energies (SBEs) of elements on these bodies remains largely unexplored. Accurate SBE values are essential for reliably predicting sputtering yields and the energy distribution of ejecta. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to quantify SBEs for the different elements sputtered from amorphous atomic arrangements of the plagioclase feldspar end members, albite and anorthite, and compare to their crystalline counterparts. Results show that while the mean elemental SBEs from amorphous surfaces are not significantly different from their crystalline counterparts, the random orientation in amorphous structures gives rise to a spectrum of bonding configurations, resulting in a distribution of SBEs with a wider range. This contrasts with the clearly discretized set of SBE values associated with the ordered atomic structure of crystalline surfaces. We then consider sputtering by H, He, and a solar wind combination of 96% H and 4% He. For each of these cases, we demonstrate that there is minimal difference (&lt;10% for albite and &lt;20% for anorthite) between the sputtering yields of amorphous and crystalline surfaces. We attribute these results to the presence of the same elemental bonds across different atomic arrangements, which leads to similar mean SBEs and, consequently, comparable sputtering yields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Bounds on Heavy QCD Axions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</a><span class="id">[2510.23695]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on heavy QCD axions. BBN offers a powerful probe of new physics that modifies the neutron-to-proton ratio during the process, thanks to the precisely measured primordial Helium-4 abundance. A heavy QCD axion provides an attractive target for this probe, because not only is it a well-motivated hypothetical particle by the strong CP problem, but also it dominantly decays to hadrons if kinematically allowed. A range of its lifetime is thus excluded where the hadronic decays would significantly alter the neutron-to-proton ratio. We compute axion-induced modification of the neutron-to-proton ratio, and obtain robust upper bounds on the axion lifetimes, as low as 0.017 s for the axion mass higher than 300 MeV. Remarkably, this is stronger than projected future CMB bounds via $N_{\rm eff}$. Our bounds are largely insensitive to uncertainties in hadronic cross sections and the axion's branching fractions into various hadrons, as well as to the precise value of the initial axion abundance. We also incorporate, for the first time, several key improvements, such as scattering processes by energetic $K_L$ and secondary hadrons, that can also be important for studying general hadronic injections during BBN, not limited to those from axion decays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glimpsing Physics of Nano-Hz Gravitational Waves in Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2510.23713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The growing evidence for nano-hertz gravitational waves, from NANOGrav and other observations, may be pointing to a cosmological first-order phase transition at temperatures of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)\;\mathrm{MeV}$.

In contrast to canonical WIMPs, which are now strongly constrained by direct and indirect searches, secluded models still achieve the observed relic abundance via thermal freeze-out into hidden-sector mediators, while predicting highly suppressed present-day signals. We analyze three minimal models: (i) a $U(1)_X$ gauge boson ($A'$) with kinetic mixing; (ii) a scalar DM candidate $S$ with a scalar mediator $K$ that has a trilinear vertex; and (iii) a Dirac fermion $\chi$ whose mass arises from a Higgs-mixed singlet $H_p$. For each model we derive annihilation and scattering rates in both WIMP-like and secluded regimes, and solve the Boltzmann equations: a single-species equation for the WIMP case and a coupled $\chi$-$\phi$ system for the secluded case to account for possible early departure of the mediator from thermal equilibrium with the SM bath. In this regard, we provide explicit lower limits on the portal coupling $\epsilon$ required to keep the mediator in thermal equilibrium with the SM bath and to ensure mediator decay before BBN. We show that for portal couplings $\epsilon \ll 10^{-3}$ the relic density is dominantly controlled by DM annihilation into mediator pairs, while spin-independent scattering lies well below current limits and remains viable even for future experiments approaching the irreducible neutrino background floor. Indirect constraints are typically weak due to $p$-wave suppression, off-resonance $s$-channels, and cascade spectra controlled by $\epsilon^2$. Finally, we highlight the most promising collider tests, which remain sensitive despite tiny portal couplings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Theory-agnostic searches of non-gravitational modes in the ringdown</a><span class="id">[2510.23774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a theory-agnostic framework to search for extra-fundamental modes in the ringdown phase of black hole mergers.

Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an additional force and the non-conservation of the energy–momentum tensor, which can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar–tensor formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics. Furthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of matter creation processes.

Within this revised perturbative QCD model, we find that if we require only that the energy per baryon of up-down ($ud$) quark matter exceeds 930 MeV so as not to contradict the standard nuclear physics, the maximum mass of an $ud$ quark star allowed by the revised perturbative QCD model can reach up to 2.17 $M_{\odot}$.

However, the interpretation of this result was later challenged by several studies, which emphasised the possible influence of additional kinematic effects on the observed signal, like the transverse Doppler effect.

For ideal modeling of these opacity fluctuations, one of the main challenges is to satisfy the extremely high dynamic range requirements of the simulation box, resolving the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest while probing the large cosmological scales. In this study, we adopt an efficient approach to model Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations in a coarse simulation volume, utilizing the semi-numerical reionization model SCRIPT (including inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback) integrated with a realistic photoionization background fluctuation generating model. Our model crucially incorporates ionization and temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the reionization model. After calibrating our method with respect to high-resolution full hydrodynamic simulation, Nyx, we compared the models with available observational data at the redshift range, $z=5.0-6.1$. With a fiducial reionization model (reionization end at $z=5.8$), we demonstrated that the observed scatter in the effective optical depth can be matched reasonably well by tuning the free parameters of our model, i.e., the effective ionizing photon mean free path and mean photoionization rate. We further pursued an MCMC-based parameter space exploration, utilizing the available data to put constraints on the above free parameters. Our estimation prefers a slightly higher photoionization rate and slightly lower mean free path than the previous studies, which is also a consequence of temperature fluctuations.

The method's robustness is confirmed against false positives using both simulated noisy data and real-world, known-null observations. Future improvements in optical clock precision and telescope bandwidth, particularly with instruments such as the Qitai Radio Telescope, may enhance constraints on the axion decay constant by up to four orders of magnitude in the $10^{-6} \sim 10^{-4}$ eV mass range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology</a><span class="id">[2505.18264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and CMB distance priors. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt; G$, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07193" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2507.07193]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $γ$-ray bursts</a><span class="id">[2507.17315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST/MIRI Imaging of the Warm Dust Component of the Epsilon Eridani Debris Disk</a><span class="id">[2509.24976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST/MIRI observations of the debris disk surrounding the nearby, solar analog Epsilon Eridani obtained as part of the Archetypal Debris Disk GTO program.

Maps of the color temperature and opacity constrain the dust properties while radiative transfer modeling of a warm dust component traces the interaction between the debris disk and Epsilon Eri b ($\sim$3.5 au). Dynamical and collisional modeling further shows that the disk morphology is dominated by dust produced in the outer planetesimal belt ($\sim 70 \, au$) moving inward via stellar wind drag. We confirm the presence of a disk interior to the Epsilon Eri b orbit first detected from mid-IR interferometry. Drag dominated inner disk regions have also been observed around Vega and Fomalhaut hinting at the diversity of asteroid belt analogs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icy or rocky?

New interior models of Uranus and Neptune</a><span class="id">[2510.00175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new framework for constructing agnostic and yet physical models for planetary interiors and apply it to Uranus and Neptune. Unlike previous research that either impose rigid assumptions or rely on simplified empirical profiles, our approach bridges both paradigms. Starting from randomly generated density profiles, we applied an iterative algorithm that converges towards models that simultaneously satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium, match the observed gravitational moments, and remain thermodynamically and compositionally consistent. The inferred interior models for Uranus and Neptune span a wide range of possible interior structures, in particular encompassing both water-dominated and rock-dominated configurations (rock-to-water mass ratios between 0.04-3.92 for Uranus and 0.20-1.78 for Neptune). All models contain convective regions with ionic water and have temperature-pressure profiles that remain above the demixing curves for hydrogen-helium-water mixtures. This offers both a plausible explanation for the observed non-dipolar magnetic fields and indicates that no hydrogen-helium-water demixing occurs. We find a higher H-He mass fraction in the outermost convection zones for Uranus (0.62-0.73) compared to Neptune (0.25-0.49) and that Uranus' magnetic field is likely generated deeper in the interior compared to Neptune. We infer upper limits of 0.69-0.74 (Uranus) versus 0.78-0.92 (Neptune) for the outer edges of the dynamo regions in units of normalised radii. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional classification of Uranus and Neptune as 'ice giants' and underscore the need for improved observational data or formation constraints to break compositional degeneracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reexamining Evidence of a Pair-Instability Mass Gap in the Binary Black Hole Population</a><span class="id">[2510.18867]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fourth gravitational wave transient catalog (GWTC-4) has enabled empirical probes of the theorized pair-instability gap in the higher end of the binary black hole (BBH) mass-spectrum. In this letter, using flexibly parametrized models, we show that at present there is no evidence of a sharp drop-off in the spectrum of black hole masses near $~40-50M_{\odot}$. We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction ($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors. We note that our results do not exclude that a high-mass gap may be identified as our sample size increases. We constrain the lower bound on the location of a possible PISN cutoff still allowed within measurement uncertainties to be $(57^{+17}_{-10}M_{\odot})$ and discuss its implications on the S factor of $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha, \gamma)^{16}O$ at 300 kev.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A</a><span class="id">[2510.19132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB 250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of the eccentricity on the collapse of an ellipsoid into a black hole</a><span class="id">[2412.14358]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid.

If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational effect of microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals for Galactic sources and lenses in the point mass lens approximation. In particular, we examine the regions of the parameter space that are promising for lensed CW searches, and perform example simulations to demonstrate how the lensing effect affects the continuous-wave signal. We show that an analytical lensing pattern can be identified from the lensed continuous wave signal using the Time-Domain F-statistic search, as the estimated signal-to-noise ratio in each time-domain segment scales directly with the amplification factor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learning about neutron star composition from the slope of the mass-radius diagram</a><span class="id">[2506.00550]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The slope of the neutron star mass-radius curve, $dM/dR$, is studied to understand the information it may carry about the composition of neutron stars, particularly with regard to the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom. This study uses two large sets of relativistic mean-field equations of state with either nucleonic or nucleonic and hyperonic degrees of freedom, and imposes constraints obtained from GW170817 and the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. It is shown that: i) some mass-radius curves are characterized by a negative slope from one solar mass up to the maximum mass; ii) other equations of state (EoS) have a positive slope for a given range of masses below the maximum star mass. Within the set of models considered, the first set includes only a very small number of hyperonic EoS: less than 0.5\% of the total number of hyperonic stars and approximately one third of the nucleonic EoS. We have also analyzed the sign of the slope for neutron star masses of 1.2, 1.4 and 1.8$M_\odot$. Only approximately 1\% of hyperonic equations of state (EoS) predict a negative slope for 1.4$M_\odot$ stars, whereas over 90\% of nucleonic stars have a negative slope at this mass. Finally, almost all stars have a negative slope at 1.8$M_\odot$. A positive slope at 1.4$M_\odot$ may indicate the presence of non-nucleonic degrees of freedom within neutron stars. The nuclear matter property that distinguishes the different scenarios most clearly is the curvature of the symmetry energy. Nucleonic EoSs with a positive slope $dM/dR$ predict the highest values, which can exceed 100 MeV.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflation Model Based on Virasoro Squeezing</a><span class="id">[2507.02236]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel mechanism for realizing slow-roll inflation that is fully consistent with observational data, based on conformal transformations acting exclusively on a complex scalar field – without coupling to the gravitational sector.

Our framework utilizes squeezing operations generated by the Virasoro algebra without central extension, as developed in our earlier work. The resulting inflationary potentials depend on the Virasoro mode $n$, the power $m$ of the original potential, and the squeezing parameter $\theta$. We present approximate analytical expressions at leading order for the special case $n=-2$, and perform numerical analyses for both $n=-2$ and other values of $n$.

In contrast to other (mostly phenomenological) approaches to Lorentz violations with modified dispersions leading to drastic changes on the formation length for the cascade development in the atmosphere and in detectors, there is the possibility that the dispersion effect in the present string foam model avoids such modifications and the theory naturally escapes the shower formation constraints from recent observations.</p></div></details></article></body>
