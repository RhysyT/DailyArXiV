Nearest-neighbour statistics and observational biases</a><span class="id">[2601.20928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars form as molecular clouds fragment into networks of dense cores, filaments, and subclusters. The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/\pi\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

So far, the most direct evidence for BH*s comes from a handful of sources where the host galaxy is completely outshone as suggested by their remarkably steep Balmer breaks. Here we present a novel scheme to disentangle BH*s from their host galaxies assuming that the [OIII]5008Å line arises exclusively from the host. Using a sample of 98 LRDs ($z$ $2-9$) with high quality NIRSpec/PRISM spectra, we demonstrate that the host-subtracted median stack displays a Balmer break $&gt;2\times$ stronger than massive quiescent galaxies, with the rest-optical continuum resembling a blackbody-like SED ($T_{\rm{eff}}$ $4050$ K, $\log(L_{\rm{bol}})$ $43.9$ erg s$^{-1}$, $R_{\rm{eff}}$ $1300$ au). We measure a steep Balmer decrement (H$\alpha$/H$\beta&gt;10$) and numerous density-sensitive features (e.g., FeII, HeI, OI). These are hallmark signatures of dense gas envelopes, providing population-level evidence that BH*s indeed power LRDs. In the median LRD, BH*s account for $\sim20\%$ of the UV emission, $\sim50\%$ at the Balmer break, and $\sim90\%$ at wavelengths longer than H$\alpha$ with the remainder arising from the host. BH*s preferentially reside in low-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm{\star}}$ $10^{8}\,{\rm M}_{\rm{\odot}}$) undergoing recent starbursts, as evidenced by extreme emission line EWs (e.g., [OIII]5008Å $1100$Å, CIII] $12$Å), thereby favoring BH* origins linked to star-formation. We show V-shaped LRD selections are biased to high BH*/host fractions ($\gtrsim60\%$ at 5500Å) – less dominant BH*s may be powering JWST's blue broad-line AGN. We find BH*s are so commonplace and transient (duty cycle $\sim1\%$, lifetime $\sim10$ Myrs) that every massive black hole may have once shone as a BH*.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's More Complicated Than You Think: A Forward Model to Infer the Recent Star Formation History, Bursty or Not, of Galaxy Populations</a><span class="id">[2601.20930]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of the early Universe (z &gt; 4) with the James Webb Space Telescope reveal galaxy populations with a wide range of intrinsic luminosities and colors. Bursty star formation histories (SFHs), characterized by short-term fluctuations in the star formation rate (SFR), may explain this diversity, but constraining burst timescales and amplitudes in individual galaxies is challenging due to degeneracies and sensitivity limits. We introduce a population-level simulation-based inference framework that recovers the power and timescales of SFR fluctuations by forward-modeling galaxy populations and distributions of rest-UV to rest-optical spectral features sensitive to star formation timescales. We adopt a stochastic SFH model based on a power spectral density formalism spanning 1 Myr-10 Gyr. Using simulated samples of N=500 galaxies at z 4 with typical JWST/NIRSpec uncertainties, we demonstrate that: (i) the power of SFR fluctuations can be measured with sufficient precision to distinguish between simulations (e.g., FIRE-2-like vs. Illustris-like populations at &gt;99% confidence for timescales &lt; 100 Myr); (ii) simultaneously modeling stochastic fluctuations and the recent (t_L &lt; 500 Myr) average SFH slope is essential, as secular trends otherwise mimic burstiness in common diagnostics; (iii) frequent, intense bursts impose an outshining limit, and bias inference toward underestimating burstiness due to the obscuration of long-timescale power; and (iv) the power of SFR fluctuations can be inferred to 95% confidence across all timescales in both smooth and bursty populations. This framework establishes a novel and robust method for placing quantitative constraints on the feedback physics regulating star formation using large, uniformly selected spectroscopic samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How supermassive black holes shape central entropies in galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.20932]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant fraction of galaxy clusters show central cooling times of less than 1 Gyr and associated central cluster entropies below $30\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{cm}^2$. We provide a straight forward explanation for these low central entropies in cool core systems and how this is related to accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Assuming a time-averaged equilibrium between active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet heating of the radiatively cooling intracluster medium (ICM) as well as Bondi accretion, we derive an equilibrium entropy that scales with the SMBH and cluster mass as $K\propto M_\bullet^{4/3}M_{500\mathrm{c}}^{-1}$. At fixed cluster mass, overly massive SMBHs would raise the central entropy above the cool core threshold, thus implying a novel way of limiting SMBH masses in cool core clusters. We find a limiting mass of $1.4\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in a cool core cluster of mass $10^{15}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We carry out three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of an idealized Perseus-like cluster with AGN jets and find that they reproduce the predictions of our analytic model, once corrections for elevated jet entropies are applied in calculating X-ray emissivity-weighted cluster entropies. Our findings have significant implications for modelling galaxy clusters in cosmological simulations: a combination of overmassive SMBHs and high heating efficiencies preclude the formation of cool core clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20941" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What drives bar rotation? The effect of internal properties and galaxy interactions on bar pattern speeds</a><span class="id">[2601.20941]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the main properties of galactic bars is their rotation (or pattern) speed, which is driven by both internal galactic properties, as well as external interactions. To assess the influence of these internal and external drivers on bar rotation in a cosmological setting, we use the Auriga suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We calculate the bar pattern speed and the bar rotation rate - the ratio of corotation radius to bar length - at the time of bar formation and at z=0, and compare these to bar age, bar strength, baryon dominance, galaxy stellar mass, and the history of external galaxy interactions. We find that galaxies which are more baryon dominated at z=0 - and which lie above the observed stellar mass-halo mass abundance matching relation - host faster bars, while more dark matter dominated galaxies host slower bars. Baryon-dominated galaxies also form their bars earlier and their rotation rates stay constant or even decrease over time; this leads to older bars being faster than their younger counterparts - in contrast to the expectation of bar slow-down from dynamical friction imparted by the dark matter halo. We also find a trend in stellar mass, with 'faster' bars being hosted in more massive galaxies, which could be driven by the underlying higher baryon-dominance of more massive galaxies. Furthermore, we find that external interactions, such as mergers and flybys, correlate with lower bar rotation rates, particularly for strong interactions that occur around bar formation time. This correlation is relatively weak, leaving internal baryon-dominance as the main driver of fast bar rotation rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation hydrodynamic simulation of the Haro 11 galaxy: the escape of LyC and Ly$α$ in a dwarf galaxy merger</a><span class="id">[2601.20943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Haro 11 galaxy merger is the closest known Lyman Continuum (LyC) leaker and a strong Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emitter, making it an important analogue of the high-$z$ galaxies that reionised the early Universe. To investigate how Haro 11's properties arise, we perform a radiation hydrodynamics simulation of the merger, and create mock observations of LyC, Ly$\alpha$, and H$\alpha$, from which we compute their luminosities ($L$) and escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$). We track these quantities along multiple sightlines as the two progenitor galaxies merge, from the first interaction until the system resembles present-day Haro 11. We find that $L$ and $f_{\rm esc}$ vary by 1-2 orders of magnitude for LyC due to sightline variations. At the two pericentre passages, the total $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ increases by roughly an order of magnitude. Conversely, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm Ly\alpha}$ shows a moderate increase at the pericentre passages, which affects the inference of LyC properties from Ly$\alpha$. We attribute this to a displacement of the LyC-emitting stars relative to the \Lya-emitting gas, combined with an increased density from gas compression. Furthermore, $f_{\rm esc}^{\rm LyC}$ is boosted during star formation bursts, likely due to stellar feedback. As direct comparison with Haro 11, the simulation qualitatively matches its morphology and luminosities. We find that among the dense stellar knots, knot C is the main contributor to both intrinsic and escaping LyC emission. Additionally, the Ly$\alpha$ spectra displays distinct features found in observations, implying similar gas conditions are present.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: Early Release Observations – The star-formation history of massive early-type galaxies in the Perseus cluster</a><span class="id">[2601.20948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) programme targeted the Perseus galaxy cluster in its central region over 0.7deg$^2$. We combined the exceptional image quality and depth of the ERO-Perseus with FUV and NUV observations from GALEX and AstroSat/UVIT, as well as $ugrizH\alpha$ data from MegaCam at the CFHT, to deliver FUV-to-NIR magnitudes of the 87 brightest galaxies within the Perseus cluster. We reconstructed the star-formation history (SFH) of 59 early-type galaxies (ETGs) within the sample, through the spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code CIGALE and state-of-the-art stellar population (SP) models to reproduce the galactic UV emission from hot, old, low-mass stars (i.e. the UV upturn). In addition, for the six most massive ETGs in Perseus [stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) \geq 10.3$], we analysed their spatially resolved SP through a radial SED fitting. In agreement with our previous work on Virgo ETGs, we found that (i) the majority of ETGs needs the presence of an UV upturn to explain their FUV emission, with temperatures $\langle T_{\rm UV}\rangle$ 33800 K; (ii) ETGs have grown their stellar masses quickly, with SF timescales $\tau\lesssim 1500$ Myr. We found that all ETGs in the sample have formed more than about 30% of their stellar masses at z 5, up to  100%. At z 5, the stellar masses of the most massive nearby ETGs, which have present-day stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\gtrsim 10.8$, are then found to be comparable to those of the red quiescent galaxies observed by JWST at similar redshifts (z&gt;4.6). This study can be extended to ETGs in the 14000 deg$^2$ extragalactic sky that will soon be observed by Euclid, in combination with those from other major upcoming surveys (e.g. Rubin/LSST), and UV observations, to ultimately assess whether the nearby massive ETGs represent the progeny of the massive high-z JWST red quiescent galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anomalous narrow line Seyfert I galaxies from SDSS DR17</a><span class="id">[2601.20957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of 22,656 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLSy1s) from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR17 ($0.1\leq z\leq 0.9$), identifying a sample of spectroscopically anomalous sources. These anomalies were detected via the spectroscopic quasar anomaly detection (SQuAD) algorithm, which employed principal component analysis and hierarchical k-means clustering. Various physical diagnostic analysis were performed such as the color excess ($E_{(B-V)}$) calculations, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) color analysis, probing O III, equivalent width as an inclination indicator, the BPT diagram and eigenvector 1 diagram. We detected 620 anomalous NLSy1s classified into two groups i.e. 246, Red NLSy1s, exhibiting host galaxy dominated spectra with a low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) core revealed by the emission line widths. Another set of 374 Blue NLSy1s, strongly luminous galaxies with enhanced AGN activity, bluer continuum as compared to a typical NLSy1 and stronger Fe II emission. Finally, the third group of 257 outliers, identified as Intermediate Seyferts, a class of Seyfert galaxies identified by composite emission profiles, and extremely strong emission lines paired with virtually no continuum. These sources also exhibit rare and high ionization emission lines unseen in any other NLSy1 spectra (e.g. [Ne V]$\lambda3345$, Ne V $\lambda3426$, Ne III $\lambda3869$ etc). We conclude that the differentiating factor between red and blue NLSy1s is not dust obscuration or orientation effect, but intrinsic distinction in AGN activity. The resulting sample is presented as a value-added catalog.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal features as tracers of galaxy merger histories: the colours of tidal features in HSC-SSP</a><span class="id">[2601.20974]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We measure the radial $g-i$ colour profiles of $\sim$32,000 galaxies drawn from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program optical imaging survey, including 1415 exhibiting tidal features. We compare the colour profiles of galaxies with and without tidal features to extract information about the properties of the mergers that created these features. We find negative colour gradients for both galaxies with and without tidal features and find that tidal feature-hosting red sequence galaxies have redder outskirts than their non-tidal feature hosting counterparts, consistent with the outskirts of these galaxies being dominated by stars accreted from gas-poor minor mergers. We find decreasing mass ratios of tidal features-to-host galaxy with increasing galaxy stellar mass, suggesting that less massive galaxies undergo mergers with companions closer in mass than more massive galaxies. Galaxies exhibiting streams have bluer outskirts than those hosting shells, and shells around red sequence galaxies tend to be more massive and have higher mass ratios to their hosts than streams, consistent with streams being formed from mergers with satellites less massive than those responsible for shells. The agreement between our findings and those of other observational and simulation-based works confirms the validity of our methodology and highlights the value of tidal features colours as a probe into the process through which galaxies evolve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of Polarized Radio Sources in the Wide Chandra Deep Field South from 2 to 4GHz</a><span class="id">[2601.20982]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of the linear polarization properties of radio sources within the 10 deg$^2$ Wide Chandra Deep Field South (W-CDFS) in S-band (2-4 GHz). Our W-CDFS image has an angular resolution of 15 arcsec and a 1$\sigma$ RMS in Stokes $I$ of $\approx$50 $\mu$Jy/beam. We detect 1920 distinct source components in Stokes $I$ and 175 in linear polarization. We examine the polarized source counts, Faraday Rotation measures, and fractional polarization of the sources in the survey. We show that sources with a total intensity above $\approx$10mJy have a mean fractional polarization value of $\approx$3% from modeling the polarized counts. We also calculate an estimate for the limit on the fractional polarization level of sources with a total intensity below 1mJy (mostly star-forming galaxies) of $\stackrel{&lt;}{_{\sim}}$3% using stacking. The mean Faraday Rotation we measure is consistent with that due to the Milky Way. We also show that fractional polarization is correlated with in-band spectral index, consistent with a lower mean fractional polarization for the flat-spectrum population. In addition to characterizing the S-band polarization properties of sources in the W-CDFS, this study will be used to validate the shallower, but higher angular resolution S-band polarimetric information that the VLA Sky Survey will provide for the whole sky above Declination -40 degrees over the next few years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radio-Near Infrared Imaging of Dual Active Galactic Nuclei Candidates</a><span class="id">[2601.20984]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the results of a pilot study that searched for dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) in local ($z&lt;$0.25) galaxies hosting double-peaked narrow emission lines in their optical spectra.

In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The LEGARE Project. I. Chemical evolution model of the Nuclear Stellar Disc in a Bayesian framework</a><span class="id">[2601.21032]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Nuclear Stellar Disc (NSD) of the Milky Way is a dense, rotating stellar system in the central 200 pc. The NSD is thought to be primarily fuelled by bar-driven gas inflows from the inner Galactic disc. As part of the LEGARE project, we construct the first chemical evolution models for the NSD using a Bayesian approach tailored to reproduce the observed metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) and compared with the available abundance ratios for Mg, Si, Ca relative to Fe. We adopt a state-of-the-art chemical evolution model in which the gas responsible for the formation of the NSD is assumed to be driven by the Galactic bar-induced inflows. The chemical composition of the accreted material is assumed to reflect that of the Galactic disc at a radius of 4 kpc. A Bayesian MCMC framework is used to fit the MDFs of different samples of NSD stars. If we take the NSD data at face value, without considering a possible contamination from bulge stars, we find that a formation scenario based on the inner disc flowing gas is inconsistent with the low metallicity tail of the observed MDF. This is because the inner disc metallicity, at the epoch of bar formation, was already near solar. On the other hand, models invoking dilution from additional metal-poor inflows successfully reproduce the observations. The best-fit model requires inflow metallicity 5 times lower than the inner disc and a moderate star formation efficiency. The same model successfully reproduces the observed [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] ratios and predicts a star formation history consistent with the most recent estimates. However, if we assume that the MDF is contaminated by metal poor bulge stars and restricted to [Fe/H] &gt; -0.3 dex, gas dilution is no longer required. In this case, the best-fit model has a very low star formation efficiency and a mild galactic wind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A rotation-based census of blue lurker candidates in open clusters</a><span class="id">[2601.21059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blue lurkers (BLs) are rejuvenated main-sequence stars hidden among normal main-sequence stars on color-magnitude diagrams of star clusters. In comparison, the blue straggler stars, formed via similar mass transfers or mergers, occupy a distinct space in the color-magnitude diagrams. We compile a list of BL candidates in open clusters using available rotation catalogs. BLs can be identified using either unusually faster rotation compared to similar mass stars, which is a signature of recent accretion, or the presence of a companion, which can only be formed by mass donation, e.g., an extremely low mass white dwarf. Here, we searched for fast-rotating stars on the main sequence of open clusters using Kepler, TESS, and spectroscopic rotation indicators, such as rotation periods and $v\sin i$ measurements. We identified 97 new BL candidates across 35 open clusters, almost tripling the previously known sample of 36. Based on the estimated completeness of $\approx$3\%, thousands of BLs are likely hidden within the cluster population. Detailed spectroscopic and time-series analyses will be essential to confirm their mass-transfer histories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NOCTURNE. I. The radio spectrum of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.21099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of the radio emission in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still debated. Multiple physical mechanisms can contribute to the spectrum at these frequencies, including relativistic jets, the jet base, outflows, star formation, and synchrotron emission from the hot corona. Recently, new extreme radio variability has been observed in the class of low-mass/high-Eddington AGN known as narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, suggesting that another, more exotic mechanism may also play a role, especially at frequencies above 10 GHz. To investigate this relatively unexplored area of the radio spectrum, we observed a sample of 50 NLS1s with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA), and 20 of them were observed twice. In this sample, 24 sources were not detected, while the others are typically characterized by a steep spectrum that can be modeled with a power law. We also identified two new candidate jetted NLS1s, including a high-frequency peaker, which is an extremely young relativistic jet. We found no significant variability in the sources observed twice. We conclude that the radio spectrum of NLS1s is typically dominated by optically thin emission, likely from low-power outflows, or by circumnuclear star formation, with a limited contribution from relativistic jets. Further studies at different spatial scales and at other wavelengths are necessary to fully constrain the origin of the radio emission in this class of active galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk Wind Feedback from High-mass Protostars.

We present a multi-modal deep learning framework that jointly leverages spatial and spectral information from CO observations to infer outflow mass, inclination, and position angle ($PA$). Our model, trained on synthetic ALMA observations generated from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations, utilizes a cross-attention fusion mechanism to integrate morphological and kinematic features with probabilistic uncertainty estimation. Our results demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures significantly outperform convolutional networks, showing remarkable robustness to reduced spatial resolution. Interpretability analysis reveals a physically consistent hierarchy: spatial features dominate across all parameters, whereas spectral profiles provide secondary constraints for mass and inclination. Applied to observational ALMA data, the framework delivers stable mass and $PA$ estimates with exceptionally tightly constrained inclination angles. This study establishes multi-modal deep learning as a powerful, interpretable tool for overcoming projection biases in high-mass star formation studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comprehensive Network for the Discovery and Characterization of Interstellar Objects</a><span class="id">[2601.21184]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar object (ISO) astronomy has rapidly emerged over the past decade as a new frontier in planetary astrophysics, yet current observations remain limited by short visibility windows, inference degeneracies and fragmented follow-up capabilities.

We propose the Comprehensive ISO Network (CISON) which combines dual hemisphere wide-field discovery with rapid high resolution characterization and selective escalation to interceptor missions. By coupling this architecture to the differential formulation of the Loeb Scale, ISO classification and risk assessment become predictive rather than reactive. This framework transforms ISO astronomy into a mature, scalable discipline capable of maximizing scientific return and informing planetary defense in the coming decades.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evaluating Classifications of Extremely Metal-poor Candidates Selected from Gaia XP Spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.21292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extremely metal-poor stars are intrinsically rare, but emerging methods exist to accurately classify them from all-sky Gaia XP low-resolution spectra. To assess their overall accuracy for targeting metal-poor stars, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic followup of 75 very metal-poor candidates selected from the catalog by R. Andrae, V. Chandra, and H. W. Rix. We discover 2 new extremely metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe / H]}&lt;-3$) stars and 20 new very metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -2$) stars. Abundances of up to 22 elements are derived from 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis and kinematic parameters are derived using Gaia astrometry and spectroscopic radial velocities. The chemodynamical properties are mostly consistent with expectations for halo stars, but we discover an Mg-enhanced CEMP star ($\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} = 0.89$) and an Mg-poor star from an accreted ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. The Gaia XP metallicity estimates are consistent with our $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ measurements down to $\rm{[Fe/H]}\sim -3.0$, but estimates worsen in highly extincted regions. We find that 4 other XP-based metallicity catalogs succeed in mitigating contaminants and can also classify metal-poor stars robustly to $\rm{[Fe/H]}\sim -3.0$. Our results demonstrate the utility of Gaia XP spectra for identifying the most metal-poor stars across the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TeV Gamma-Rays from the Low-Luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus NGC 4278: Implications for the Diffuse Neutrino Background</a><span class="id">[2601.21411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates the origin of the TeV emission detected by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) from NGC 4278, a galaxy hosting a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN). Considering two plausible scenarios, AGN jets and winds, we model the X-ray, GeV, and TeV emission during both TeV-low (quasi-quiet) and TeV-high (active) states. The spectral energy distributions can be explained either by single-zone leptonic emission from moderately relativistic jets or by lepto-hadronic emission from sub-relativistic winds. The best-fit parameters suggest that the transition from the quasi-quiet to the active state may be driven jointly by an enhanced accretion rate and the expansion of jets or winds. We further show that future MeV and very-high-energy $\gamma$-ray observations can discriminate between the {leptonic and lepto-hadronic scenarios}. Although the neutrino flux from NGC 1068 predicted by the wind model is too low to be detected with current neutrino observatories, a lepto-hadronic wind scenario can account for the PeV diffuse neutrino background when adopting a local LLAGN density corrected for the TeV duty cycle, $n_{\rm L,0}(\Delta T_{\rm TeV}/T) \sim 10^{-5}~\rm Mpc^{-3}$, as inferred from the LHAASO detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MgAl burning chain in M 54: the globular cluster-like properties of a nuclear star cluster</a><span class="id">[2601.21440]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we present the chemical abundances of Fe, Mg, Al, Si, and K for a sample of 233 likely member stars of M 54. All the stars were observed with the FLAMES high-resolution multi-object spectrograph mounted at the VLT. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a large metallicity range in M 54, with the majority of the stars having -1.8 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1.0 dex and few stars with [Fe/H] &gt; -1.0 dex. The mean value of the total sample is [Fe/H] = -1.40 ({\sigma} = 0.22 dex). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that the observed spread in [Fe/H] is compatible with a non-null intrinsic iron dispersion. We also found that the metallicity distribution function and the broadening of the red giant branch of M 54 are not compatible with a single age, but instead they suggest a wide age range from   13 Gyr to   1 - 2 Gyr or a smaller age range if a significant He enhancement (Y   0.35/0.40) is present in the most metal-rich stars. We identified among the stars in M 54 the entire pattern of anticorrelations linked to the MgAl burning cycle. In particular, the metal-rich component displays a higher level of H-burning with the presence of more extended anticorrelations than the metal-poor component. No Mg-poor ([Mg/Fe]&lt;0.0 dex) stars are identified in M 54. The evidence collected so far cannot be explained neither with a globular cluster-like scenario nor with a galactic chemical evolution. The chemical properties of M 54 can be explained within a scenario where this system formed through the merging of two globular clusters, the metal-poor one with standard characteristics and the more metal-rich one with more pronounced chemical anomalies, a possibly younger than the first one. M 54 is confirmed as a key stellar system for explaining the chemical evolution of a nuclear star cluster.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nucleus and Postperihelion Activity of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Observed by Hubble Space Telescope</a><span class="id">[2601.21569]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the successful detection of the nucleus of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, achieved by applying the nucleus extraction technique to our Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations from December 2025 to January 2026. The product of the V-band geometric albedo, $p_V$, with the physical cross-section of the nucleus is $0.22 \pm 0.07$ km$^{2}$, which corresponds to an effective radius of $1.3 \pm 0.2$ km if assuming $p_{V} = 0.04$, as is typical for cometary nuclei in the solar system. This size is in agreement with our estimate derived from the reported nongravitational effect and activity of the interstellar object. If the measured photometric variations are solely due to the rotation of an aspherical nucleus, the axis ratio must be $2:1$ or greater, and the rotation period $\gtrsim\!1$ hr. Leveraging the range of covered phase angles, we identified a significant opposition surge of $\sim\!0.2$ mag with a width of $3^\circ \pm 1^\circ$, which may include concurrent contributions from orbital plane crossing and tail projection, and determined a linear phase slope of $0.026 \pm 0.006$ mag degree$^{-1}$ for the coma dust. Compared to the preperihelion brightening trend, 3I faded more rapidly on the outbound leg, following an activity index of $4.5 \pm 0.3$, not unusual in the context of solar system comets. This activity asymmetry is further corroborated by a postperihelion coma surface brightness profile that is significantly shallower than its preperihelion counterpart. From the statistics, we infer that multiple interstellar objects resembling 3I likely went undetected even before the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy-Galaxy Blending in SPHEREx Survey Data</a><span class="id">[2601.21627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) will provide all-sky spectral survey data covering optical to mid-infrared wavelengths with a spatial resolution of 6\farcs2, which can be widely used to study galaxy formation and evolution. We investigate the galaxy-galaxy blending in SPHEREx datasets using the mock galaxy catalogs generated from cosmological simulations and observational data. Only $\sim0.7\%$ of the galaxies will be blended with other galaxies in all-sky survey data with a limiting magnitude of 19 AB mag. However, the fraction of blended galaxies dramatically increases to $\sim7$–$9\%$ in the deep survey area around the ecliptic poles, where the depth reaches $\sim22$ AB mag. We examine the impact of the blending in the number count and luminosity function analyses using the SPHEREx data. We find that the number count can be overestimated by up to $10$–$20\%$ in the deep regions due to the flux boosting, suggesting that the impact of galaxy-galaxy blending on the number count is moderate. However, galaxy-galaxy blending can marginally change the luminosity function by up to 50\%\ over a wide range of redshifts. As we only employ the magnitude limit at $K_s$-band for the source detection, the blending fractions determined in this study should be regarded as lower limits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Low-mass Model of The Milky Way: The Disk Warp Resulting from A Galaxy Merger</a><span class="id">[2601.21638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Previous studies have shown that disk warps can result from galaxy mergers. Recent research indicates a noticeable decline in the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way (MW), suggesting the need for a new low-mass model to describe its dynamical features. This study constructs a new Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) merger model to characterize the RC features of our galaxy. We use the GIZMO code to simulate mergers with various orbital parameters to investigate how the disk warp evolves under different conditions. This simulation demonstrates the evolutionary mechanism of disk warp, which arises due to the asymmetric gravitational potential of the dark matter (DM) halo generated universally by galaxy mergers. The results indicate that the tilt angle of the DM halo partly reflects the gravitational strength at the $Z=0$ plane, while the gravitational strength on the disk plane reflects the amplitude of disk warp. We identify a dual-regime interaction mechanism driven by the asymmetric halo potential. On short timescales, we find a distinct anti-correlation between the halo's tilt angle and the disk's warp amplitude, indicating a `seesaw' mechanism of angular momentum exchange. On secular timescales, however, dynamical friction drives a global alignment, causing both the halo tilt and the warp amplitude to decay simultaneously. Furthermore, we demonstrate that high-inclination mergers can sustain long-lived prograde precession, where the persistent yet decaying gravitational torque maintains the prograde bending mode against differential wind-up.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Little Red Dots and Supermassive Black Hole Seed Formation in Ultralight Dark Matter Halos</a><span class="id">[2601.21676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds form in the early Universe at the centers of ultralight dark matter (ULDM) halos. Focusing on the ULDM Jeans scale, we identify the critical conditions under which high-redshift baryonic gas, strongly confined by central solitonic cores of the halos, undergoes direct and monolithic collapse. The solitonic potential naturally drives rapid inflow and shock heating, allowing the gas to exceed the critical atomic-cooling and fragmentation-suppression threshold of $\sim 3 \times 10^4 {\rm K}$ without invoking an external UV background. We derive semi-analytic relations for the halo mass, soliton mass, baryonic core radius, and thermodynamic state of the gas, including the effects of baryonic contraction. These relations simultaneously determine the minimum and maximum SMBH seed masses as functions of redshift. In this framework, pristine gas clouds that satisfy the temperature threshold collapse without fragmentation, forming SMBH seeds with characteristic masses of order $\sim 10^5M_\odot$, while systems below the threshold are expected to form compact star clusters instead. Our model also implies an upper limit on the attainable SMBH mass, predicting a maximum mass scale of order $\sim10^{10}M_\odot$, consistent with the most massive quasars observed to date. The ULDM particle mass required to reproduce the inferred seed mass scale, $m \simeq 10^{-22}{\rm eV}$, coincides with the value favored by galactic-scale observations, providing a unified explanation for the characteristic masses of both galactic cores and early SMBH seeds. Our model predicts efficient SMBH seed formation at redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$ and offers a natural interpretation of recently observed little red dots as SMBHs embedded in compact, hot, ionized gas clouds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of hot subdwarf binaries and sdB stars using machine learning methods and a large sample of Gaia XP spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.21727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hot subdwarfs (hot sds) are compact, evolved stars near the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) and are key to understanding stellar evolution and the ultraviolet excess in galaxies. We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of Gravitational Anomaly at Low Acceleration from a Highest-quality Sample of 36 Wide Binaries with Accurate 3D Velocities</a><span class="id">[2601.21728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We set out to accurately measure gravity in the low-acceleration range $(10^{-11},10^{-9})$ m s$^{-2}$ from 3D motions of isolated wide binary stars. Gaia DR3 provides precise measurements of the four sky-plane components of the 3D relative displacement and velocity ($\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{v}$) for a wide binary, but not comparably precise line-of-sight (radial) separation and relative velocity $v_{r}$. Based on our new observations and the public databases/publications, we assemble a sample of 36 nearby (distance $&lt;150$pc) wide binaries in the low-acceleration regime with accurate values of $v_{r}$ (uncertainty $&lt; 100$ m s$^{-1}$). Kinematic contaminants such as undetected stellar companions are well under control using various observational diagnostics such as Gaia's ruwe parameter, the color-magnitude diagram, multi-epoch observations of radial velocities, Speckle interferometric follow-up observations, and requiring Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion consistency. For the parameter $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{\gamma}$ with $\gamma \equiv G/G_{\rm N}$ (where $G$ is a parameter generalizing Newton's constant $G_{\rm N}$ in elliptical orbits), we find $\Gamma=0.102_{-0.021}^{+0.023}$, inconsistent with standard gravity at $4.9\sigma$, giving a gravity boost factor of $\gamma=1.600_{-0.141}^{+0.171}$. Four wide binaries have 3D relative velocities exceeding their estimated Newtonian escape velocities with $1&lt;v_{\rm obs}/v_{\rm escN}\le1.2$. These systems are unlikely to be chance associations and are expected in a nonstandard paradigm such as Milgromian dynamics (MOND). The hypothesis that Newtonian gravity can be extrapolated to the low-acceleration limit is falsified by this independent study with accurate 3D velocities. Future radial velocity monitoring and Speckle interferometric imaging for larger samples will be useful to refine the present result.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN Variability with Rubin Observatory in the 2030s</a><span class="id">[2601.21769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AGN variability offers a direct probe of accretion physics, disk structure, and black hole growth, but progress has been limited by sample size, cadence heterogeneity, and photometric systematics. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will deliver multi-band light curves for millions of AGN, enabling variability studies at a true population scale. We synthesize recent results from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), which demonstrate that optical variability amplitudes and timescales are primarily regulated by accretion state, with secondary dependence on black hole mass and redshift, and establish the feasibility of survey-driven continuum reverberation mapping. ZTF measurements reveal optical continuum-emitting region sizes that often exceed standard thin disk predictions, implicating diffuse continuum emission from the broad line region as a significant contributor to observed inter-band lags. We evaluate the implications of LSST cadence and survey strategy, particularly the deep drilling fields, for continuum and emission line reverberation mapping, changing-look AGN, extreme variability quasars, and periodic variability searches. Key limitations of broadband photometric variability are identified, including variable emission line contamination, diffuse BLR continuum emission, and cadence-dependent lag recoverability. We argue that realizing LSST's full scientific potential requires community-scale, standardized variability metric pipelines, probabilistic classification integrated with alert brokers for follow-up triggering, and complementary medium-band photometric observations to isolate the accretion disk continuum. Together, these elements will enable LSST to convert photometric variability into quantitative constraints on accretion disks, BLR structure, and supermassive black hole growth across cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21833" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A UV-Luminous Galaxy at z=11 with Surprisingly Weak Star Formation Activity</a><span class="id">[2601.21833]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the major discoveries by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the identification of a large population of luminous galaxies at $z&gt;10$, challenging theoretical models for early galaxy formation. The unexpectedly high number density of these systems has triggered intense debate about potential differences in the physical properties of galaxies at such extreme redshifts and those at lower redshift. However, progress has been limited by the lack of rest-frame optical diagnostics, which are critical for constraining the key properties. Here we present deep JWST/MIRI observations of a UV-luminous galaxy at $z=11.04$, CEERS2-588, only 400 Myr after the Big Bang. CEERS2-588 is detected in the MIRI F560W and F770W bands, while deep MIRI/MRS spectroscopy yields no detection of H$\alpha$ or [OIII]$\lambda5007$ line, revealing a prominent Balmer break detected for the first time at $z&gt;10$. Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting indicates an extended star formation history possibly reaching $z&gt;15$, followed by rapid quenching within the recent $\sim10$ Myr, in stark contrast to other $z&gt;10$ galaxies. The MIRI detections also significantly improve our stellar mass estimate to $\mathrm{log}(M_*/M_\odot)=9.1^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$, making CEERS2-588 the most massive galaxy securely confirmed at $z&gt;10$. Remarkably, the inferred gas-phase metallicity is near solar, exceeding predictions from current theoretical models. These results suggest that efficient starbursts play a key role in producing the abundant luminous galaxy population in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital decomposition of the nuclear regions in the early-type galaxy FCC 47: Unveiling the nuclear cluster origin</a><span class="id">[2601.21889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are among the densest stellar systems in the Universe and often coexist with supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at galaxy centres.

We aim to investigate the orbital structure of the unusually large NSC in FCC 47 (NGC 1336) by decomposing its stellar orbits into dynamically distinct components. We extract stellar kinematics, and in particular the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs), from VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy using the non-parametric Bayes-LOSVD approach, and apply triaxial Schwarzschild orbit-superposition modelling with the DYNAMITE software. We decompose the orbit library into hot, warm, cold, and counter-rotating components. We detect triple-peaked LOSVDs in the nucleus, indicating a complex orbital structure. The NSC forms a counter-rotating, kinematically decoupled component. A hot pressure-supported component, a warm counter-rotating structure and a counter-rotating cold disk in the centre suggest hierarchical assembly via early star cluster accretion and later in situ star formation. Our orbital decomposition of FCC 47 supports a hybrid formation scenario for this NSC.

In both fields we find a clear detection of red giant stars in M96's halo, with a space density that corresponds to an equivalent broadband surface brightness of $\mu_V \approx $ 31.7 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find little evidence for any difference in the spatial density or color of the RGB stars in the two fields. Using isochrone matching we derive a median metallicity for the red giants of [M/H] = -1.36 with an interquartile spread of $\pm$0.75 dex. Adopting a power-law radial density profile, we also derive a total halo mass of $M_h = 7.8^{+17.4}_{-4.9}\times10^9$ M$_\odot$, implying a stellar halo mass fraction of $M_{*,halo}/M_{*,tot} = 15^{+33}_{-9}$%, on the high end for spiral galaxies, but with significant uncertainty. Finally, we find that M96 appears offset from the stellar halo mass-metallicity relationship for spirals, with a halo that is distinctly metal-poor for its halo mass. While a variety of systematic effects could have conspired to drive M96 off this relationship, if confirmed our results may argue for a markedly different accretion history for M96 compared to other spirals in the nearby universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Volatile Inventory of 3I/ATLAS as seen with JWST/MIRI</a><span class="id">[2601.22034]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first spectroscopic characterization of an interstellar object at mid-infrared wavelengths.

Our 5–28 micron spectra exhibit fluorescence features from several gaseous species, including the $\nu_2$ band of water at 5.8–7.0 microns. the primary $\nu_2$ and associated hot bands of carbon dioxide around 15 microns, and a forbidden transition of atomic nickel at 7.507 microns. We also report the first direct detection of methane in an interstellar object. The delayed onset of methane production relative to water suggests past depletion from the outermost layers, with the observed methane emerging from unprocessed subsurface material. Comparison of the volatile production rates measured during the two epochs indicate a significant reduction in overall outgassing over 12 days, with the measured water activity level dropping more steeply than other species. As shown through near-nucleus coma mapping, 3I continues to display an extended source of water production from icy grains entrained within the coma.

This approach enables reliable recovery of \Lya\ emission projected onto the quasar position without introducing subtraction artifacts. Using {\it CubeCarve}, we find that the \Lya\ surface brightness profiles of these systems are, on average, fainter and shallower than those of quasars of similar bolometric luminosities. We also find that the total integrated \Lya\ luminosities of the nebulae are lower in systems whose host galaxies exhibit brighter far-infrared emission.

Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\gtrsim 17.5\,M_{\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\approx 1.7 \pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination.

Here we present the most distant example of this class yet – MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS field at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and $\sim3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\sim14-15$ sources implied by our &quot;Mirage or Miracle&quot; survey spanning $\sim350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $&gt;100\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines ($\sim15{-}35$ Å) signal a rising star-formation history, with a $\sim10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet elongated ($b/a=0.25^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$), suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of UV light. The steep UV slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing provides tentative evidence that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 may be partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\sim100\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$&gt;1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SKYSURF IX – The Cosmic Optical and Infrared Background from Integrated Galaxy Light Measurements</a><span class="id">[2507.03412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As part of the SKYSURF Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Legacy Archival program we present galaxy number counts which yield measurements of the extragalactic background light (EBL) at 15 different wavelengths. We have processed 82,752 HST images across 23 filters into 16,686 mosaics using the same software and processing pipeline throughout. Using 17/23 filters that give reliable galaxy counts, we constrain the integrated galaxy light (IGL) with a 1.5-9\% error between 0.3 and 1.6 $\mu$m in combination with 8 bands from WAVES (Wide Area VISTA Extragalactic Survey) and DEVILS (Deep Extragalactic Visible Legacy Survey). While HST was never intended to undertake large area surveys, through extensive quality control and filtering, we were able to extract a reliable and representative sample of fields distributed across the sky. Our final catalogs cover a combined $\approx 19.6 °^2$, with individual filters covering areas ranging from $\approx 0.16-7.0 °^2$. The combination of numerous independent sight-lines and area coverage allows us to reduce cosmic variance uncertainties in deep number counts to 0.06\%-1.8\%. For the first time we are able to establish a measurement of the IGL, $\mathrm{9.07 \pm 0.35 nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$, at 0.59 $\mu$m using HST data. We obtain a cosmic optical background value of $ 24.45 \pm 0.50 \mathrm{nW m^{-2} sr^{-1}}$. Different techniques used to measure the COB, both directly and indirectly, have recently converged indicating that the COB arises almost exclusively from processes within galaxies. This in combination with the recent values reported from New Horizons and very high energy (VHE) constraints leaves very little room for any diffuse emission coming from outside the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Non-Gaussianities in Pulsar Timing Array data analysis using Gaussian Mixture Models</a><span class="id">[2508.08365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) data analysis, noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian, and the marginalized likelihood has a well-established analytical form derived within the framework of Gaussian processes. However, this Gaussianity assumption may break down for certain classes of astrophysical and cosmological signals, particularly for a gravitational wave background (GWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). In this work, we present a new method for testing the presence of non-Gaussian features in PTA data. We go beyond the Gaussian assumption by modeling the noise or signal statistics using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). An advantage of this approach is that the marginalization of the likelihood remains fully analytical, expressed as a linear combination of Gaussian PTA likelihoods. This makes the method straightforward to implement within existing data analysis tools. Moreover, this method extends beyond the free spectrum analysis by producing posterior probability distributions of higher-order moments inferred from the data, which can be incorporated into spectral refitting techniques. We validate the model using simulations and demonstrate the sensitivity of PTAs to non-Gaussianity by computing the Bayes factor in favor of the GMM as a function of the injected excess moments. We apply the method to a more astrophysically motivated scenario where a single SMBHB is resolved on top of a Gaussian GWB and show that significant non-Gaussianities are introduced by the individual source. Finally, we test our model on a realistic GWB generated from a simulated population of SMBHBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RUBIES spectroscopically confirms the high number density of quiescent galaxies from $\mathbf{2&lt;z&lt;5}$</a><span class="id">[2508.08577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the number density of massive ($ \mathrm{ log (M_{*}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 10.3} $) quiescent galaxies at $2&lt;z&lt;5$ using JWST NIRSpec PRISM spectra.

We identify quiescent galaxy candidates within RUBIES through principal component analysis and construct a final sample using star formation histories derived from spectro-photometric fitting of the NIRSpec PRISM spectra and NIRCam photometry. By inverting the RUBIES selection function, we correct for survey incompleteness and calculate the number density of massive quiescent galaxies at these redshifts, providing the most complete spectroscopic estimates prior to cosmic noon to date. We find that early massive quiescent galaxies are surprisingly common ($\gtrsim 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ by $4&lt;z&lt;5$), which is consistent with previous studies based on JWST photometry alone and/or in smaller survey areas. We compare our number densities with predictions from six state-of-the-art cosmological galaxy formation simulations.

Their physical properties are typically derived through spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, but the reliability of this approach remains uncertain owing to limited constraints on star formation histories (SFHs) and on the contribution from emission for such early systems. Applying \bagpipes\ on simulated SEDs with SFR$_{10}&gt;0.3\,M_\odot/yr$ at $z=6$ from the SPHINX cosmological simulation, we examine the uncertainties related to the recovery of stellar masses, star formation rates (SFR$_{10}$), and stellar metallicities from mock JWST/Near-Infrared Camera photometry, spanning F115W–F444W. Even without dust or emission lines, fitting the intrinsic stellar continuum overestimates the stellar mass by about 60\%, on average (and by up to a factor of five for low-mass galaxies with recent starbursts). It also underestimates the SFR$_{10}$ by a factor of 2, due to inaccurate SFHs and age-metallicity degeneracies. In full SED-fitting models that include dust attenuation and nebular emission, stellar mass estimates are primarily affected by age-metallicity degeneracy and emission lines. Short-term SFRs are most sensitive to dust attenuation and nebular emission, while long-term SFRs additionally depend on the assumed SFHs. Incorporating bands that are free of strong emission lines, such as F410M, helps mitigate stellar mass overestimation by disentangling line emission from older stellar populations. We also find that best fit or likelihood-weighted estimates are generally more accurate than median posterior values. Although stellar mass functions are reproduced reasonably well (particularly when the minimum-$\chi^2$ estimates are used), the slope of the main sequence of star formation acutely depends on the adopted fitting model.

It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPHEREx Re-Observation of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS in December 2025: Detection of Increased Post-Perihelion Activity, Refractory Coma Dust, and New Coma Gas Species</a><span class="id">[2601.06759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In December-2025, the NASA SPHEREx spacecraft re-observed ISO 3I/ATLAS post-perihelion, finding a much more active object compared to August-2025 SPHEREx pre-perihelion observations, with marked evidence for development into an cometary body fully sublimating all its ices. The new imaging spectrophotometry was dominated by spatially resolved features due to light scattered by dust, along with thermal emission, plus gas-line emissions from CN (0.93 um), H2O (2.7 um), organic C-H (3.2 to 3.6 um), CO2 (4.25 to 4.27 um), and CO (4.6 to 4.8 um).

While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\sim 15^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.</p></div></details></article>

HWO will, for the first time, enable detailed studies of the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth-like exoplanets through high-contrast reflection spectroscopy across the UV, optical, and near-infrared. These wavelength ranges provide access to key molecular absorption features, including O2, O3, H2O, CO2, and CH4, as well as potential surface biosignatures such as the vegetation red edge or ocean glint, making HWO a cornerstone mission for assessing planetary habitability. Clouds are a dominant factor in determining planetary climate and observability, yet their properties remain highly degenerate when constrained using reflected flux alone. Spectropolarimetry, a measure of the polarisation state of reflected light as a function of wavelength and orbital phase, provides a powerful complementary diagnostic. Polarisation is highly sensitive to cloud particle size, composition, shape, vertical distribution, and surface type, enabling degeneracies between atmospheric and surface models to be broken. Numerous studies have demonstrated the value of polarimetry for characterising a wide range of exoplanets, from hot Jupiters to cooler potentially habitable worlds. HWO's proposed instrument suite includes a coronagraph, a high-resolution imager, and a candidate high-resolution spectropolarimeter, offering multiple pathways to exploit polarimetry across diverse planetary regimes. This white paper argues that incorporating polarimetric capability into HWO instruments would significantly enhance the mission's scientific return. We highlight the unique opportunity for UK leadership in both instrument development and theoretical modelling, and advocate for a strong UK role in shaping HWO's polarimetric capabilities to maximise its impact on exoplanet science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20914" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Teareduce: a Python package with utilities for teaching reduction techniques in Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2601.20914]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Python package teareduce has been developed to support teaching activities related to the reduction of astronomical data.

In order to maximize the scientific return, we need a well thought strategy for selecting the observational targets, in our case exoplanets. This study evaluates various strategies for selecting exoplanet targets within limited observation windows, focusing specifically on the selection of exoplanet targets for Tier 2 transit spectroscopy with ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. We define three distinct selection criteria – sample size, variance, and leverage – and translate them into objective functions compatible with modern optimization algorithms. Specifically, we test five heuristics for maximizing sample leverage: leverage greedy, simulated annealing, K-means clustering, regular classes, and quantile classes. The performance of these methods is demonstrated through three practical exercises across one, two, and three parameters of diversity. Each criterion represents a unique trade-off between sample size, diversity, and total observation time. While a time-greedy approach maximizes the quantity of planets, it fails to capture diversity. Conversely, variance-greedy selection prioritizes diversity but introduces significant drawbacks: it oversamples rare cases and undersamples typical planets, ultimately reducing the total number of targets observed. Leverage-based selections emerge as the most effective middle ground, successfully balancing sample diversity with a robust sample size. This work supports the broader community effort to ensure that Ariel delivers the most diverse and scientifically valuable sample of exoplanet atmospheres within mission limits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data-Driven Generation of Neutron Star Equations of State Using Variational Autoencoders</a><span class="id">[2601.21231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a machine learning model based on a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to reconstruct and generate neutron star (NS) equations of state (EOS).

The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust–core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\%)$ for $(M_{\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESHIMA 2.0: A 200-400 GHz Ultra-wideband Integrated Superconducting Spectrometer</a><span class="id">[2601.21603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>DESHIMA (Deep Spectroscopic HIgh-redshift MApper) is a broadband integrated superconducting spectrometer (ISS) for millimeter (mm) / sub-millimeter (sub-mm) wave astronomy based on Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs).

The instrument features NbTiN superconducting microstrip (MS) filters with low-loss a-SiC:H dielectric and an ultra-wideband leaky-wave antenna. A laboratory setup was designed, incorporating the cryostat housing cryogenic optics and ISS chip comprising 339 KIDs connected to MS filters tuned for (sub-)mm wave frequencies. Room-temperature mirrors on a hexapod stage allowed precise positioning and alignment of optical elements.

We showed that DESHIMA 2.0 achieved significant improvements in performance compared to its predecessor (DESHIMA 1.0): measured instantaneous frequency coverage was 200$-$400 GHz with a mean filter $Q_{filter}$ of $340 \pm 50$; instrument efficiency reached $\sim8$ \%, indicating 4 times wider band coverage and 4 times higher sensitivity. The yield rate for MS filters exceeded 98 \%. The estimated aperture efficiency from measured beam patterns agreed well with the designed value of approximately 70 \%. The telescope far-field beam patterns calculated from measured beam patterns also exhibited good agreement with design specifications.

We demonstrate this framework on a simulated case study with machine learning based transit spectroscopy retrievals of exoplanet WASP-107b. Characterising many exoplanet atmospheres can answer important questions about planetary populations, but traditional retrievals are very resource intensive; machine learning based methods offer a fast alternative however (i) they require high volumes data (only obtainable through simulations) to train and (ii) their complexity renders them black-boxes. Better understanding how they reach predictions can allow us to inspect for biases, which is especially important with simulated data, and verify that predictions are made on the basis of physically plausible features. This ultimately improves the ease of adoption of machine learning techniques. The most used methods to explain machine learning model predictions (such as SHAP and other methods that rely on stochastic sample generation) suffer from high computational complexity and struggle to account for interactions between inputs. PERTURB-c addresses these issues by leveraging physical knowledge of the known spectral correlation. For visualisation of this analysis, we propose a heat-map-based representation which is better suited to large numbers of input features along a single dimension, and that is more intuitive to those who are already familiar with retrieval methods. Note that while we chose this exoplanet retrieval context to demonstrate our methodologies, the PERTURB-c framework is model agnostic and in a broader context has potential value across a plethora of adjacent regression problems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Progress towards a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code for outflow wind modelling: II. 3-D applications</a><span class="id">[2601.21782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The massive hot stars play crucial role in the dynamics of galaxies.

We present a new version of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Andy Antares with improved treatment of the velocity field for arbitrary geometries. Our aim is to develop a numerical scheme that can incorporate a general velocity field defined at discrete points. Our main objective is to calculate radiative transfer in a general input hydrodynamic model. The Andy Antares code currently calculates pure radiative transfer. The input model is pre-calculated by another hydrodynamical code. The whole radiative transfer calculation is then processed in a Cartesian grid. Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path. We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes. We also tested the radiative transfer solution on a 3-D model generated from a 2-D hydrodynamic model, and obtained emergent radiation. The code is suitable for the numerical solution of radiative transfer in 3-D with arbitrary velocity fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Critical Evaluation of Studies Alleging Evidence for Technosignatures in the POSS1-E Photographic Plates</a><span class="id">[2601.21946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies by B.

These studies have called attention to (i) a purported deficit of features within Earth's shadow; (ii) the sporadic presence of linear clusters; and (iii) a positive correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests as well as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) sighting reports. These observations were cited as evidence that some fraction of the unidentified features represent glinting artificial objects near Earth. We have examined these claims using two related, previously published datasets. When analyzing the most vetted of these, we do not observe the reported deficit in the terrestrial shadow. We determine that a third of the features in the reported linear clusters were not confidently distinguished from catalog stars. We find that the reported correlation between the timing of feature observations and nuclear tests becomes insignificant after properly normalizing by the number of observation days, and is almost completely determined by the observation schedule of the Palomar telescope. We uncover important inconsistencies in the definitions of the datasets used in these studies, as well as the use of unvalidated datasets containing catalog stars, scan artifacts, and plate defects. It has not been shown that any of the features in these datasets represent optical transients. We examine the spatial distribution of the plate-derived features, finding an overall gradual increase in number density toward the corners and edges of plates, as well as examples of (i) empty north-south strips that span multiple plates; (ii) clusters and voids having geometric shapes; and (iii) amorphous clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leveraging rapid parameter estimates for efficient gravitational-wave Bayesian inference via posterior repartitioning</a><span class="id">[2601.21630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave astronomy typically relies on rigorous, computationally expensive Bayesian analyses.

By combining the fast constraints from the simple-pe algorithm with the nested sampling acceleration technique of posterior repartitioning, we demonstrate that our method can guide the nested sampler towards the most probable regions of parameter space more efficiently for signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) greater than 20, while mathematically guaranteeing that the final inference is identical to that of a standard, uninformed analysis. We validate the method through an injection study, demonstrating that it produces statistically robust and unbiased results, whilst providing speedups of up to $2.2\times$ for binaries with SNRs $&lt; 150$. Importantly, we show that the performance gain provided by our method scales with SNR, establishing it as a powerful technique to mitigate the cost of analysing signals from current and future gravitational-wave observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimal cross-correlation technique to search for strongly lensed gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2601.22138]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As the number of detected gravitational wave (GW) events increases with the improved sensitivity of the observatories, detecting strongly lensed pairs of events is becoming a real possibility. Identifying such lensed pairs, however, remains challenging due to the computational cost and/or the reliance on prior knowledge of source parameters in existing methods. This study investigates a novel approach, Optimal Cross-Correlation Analysis for Multiplets (OCCAM), applied to strain data from one or more detectors for Compact Binary Coalescence (CBC) events identified by GW searches, using an optimal, mildly model-dependent, low computation cost approach to identify strongly lensed candidates. This technique efficiently narrows the search space, allowing for more sensitive, but (much) higher latency, algorithms to refine the results further. We demonstrate that our method performs significantly better than other computationally inexpensive methods. In particular, we achieve 97 percent (80 percent) lensed event detection at a pairwise false positive probability of approximately 13 percent (7 percent) for a single detector with LIGO design sensitivity, assuming an SNR greater than or equal to 10 astrophysically motivated lensed and unlensed populations. Thus, this method, using a network of detectors and in conjunction with sky-localisation information, can enormously reduce the false positive probability, making it highly viable to efficiently and quickly search for lensing pairs among thousands of events, including the sub-threshold candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Validating Angular Power Spectral Models for the Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Without Distributional Assumptions</a><span class="id">[2504.16959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is demonstrated that estimators of the angular power spectrum commonly used for the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) lack a closed-form analytical expression for the likelihood function and, typically, cannot be accurately approximated by a Gaussian likelihood. Nevertheless, a robust statistical analysis can be performed to enable the estimation and testing of angular power spectral models for the SGWB without specifying distributional assumptions. Here, the technical aspects of the method are discussed in detail. Moreover, a new, consistent estimator for the covariance of the angular power spectrum is derived. The proposed approach is applied to data from the third observing run (O3) of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GMIMS-DRAGONS: A Faraday Depth Survey of the Northern Sky Covering 350-1030 MHz</a><span class="id">[2510.09759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polarized synchrotron emission at meter to centimeter wavelengths provides an effective tracer of the Galactic magnetic field. Calculating Faraday depth, the most useful parameter for mapping the line-of-sight magnetic field, requires observations covering wide frequency bands with many channels. As part of the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey (GMIMS), we have observed polarized emission spanning 350-1030 MHz over the northern sky, in the declination range ${-20^{\circ}}\leq{\delta}\leq{90^{\circ}}$. We used the 15 m telescope at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO), equipped to receive orthogonal circular polarizations, with the Onsala Space Observatory band 1 feed developed for the SKA Project. Angular resolution varies across the band from $1.3^{\circ}$ to $3.6^{\circ}$. A digital spectrometer provided 42 kHz frequency resolution. Data were taken with the telescope moving rapidly in azimuth and are absolutely calibrated in intensity. Approximately 25% of the data were lost due to radio-frequency interference. The resolution in Faraday depth is $\sim6$ rad m$^{-2}$, and features as wide as $\sim38$ rad m$^{-2}$ are represented. The median sensitivity of the Faraday depth cube is 11 mK. Approximately 55% of sight-lines in this survey show Faraday complexity. This dataset, called “DRAO GMIMS of the Northern Sky” (DRAGONS), is the first to probe Faraday depth of the northern sky in its frequency range and will support many scientific investigations. The data will be used to calibrate surveys with higher angular resolution, particularly Galactic foreground maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment, and to provide information on large structures for aperture-synthesis telescopes, particularly the DRAO Synthesis Telescope. The data are available through the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.</p></div></details></article></body>
