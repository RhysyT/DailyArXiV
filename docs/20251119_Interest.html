<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MacLaurin and Morality</a><span class="id">[2511.14472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scottish mathematician Colin MacLaurin (1698-1746) is best known for his A Treatise of Fluxions (1742), An Account of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophical Discoveries (1748), and the appellation for a type of power series. However, it is hardly known that in 1714 at the age of sixteen MacLaurin penned a short manuscript wherein he tried to apply Newtonian principles to morality, in an approach to mathematization that suggests strong continuities with earlier centuries. De viribus mentium bonipetis (On the good-seeking forces of minds) remained unpublished and hidden in the papers of the Colin Campbell Collection at the University of Edinburgh for over 250 years; it was only uncovered at the end of the twentieth century. De viribus provides a remarkable glimpse into how the young MacLaurin dealt with early Newtonianism, the tenets of the Church of Scotland, and the nascent interface between science and religion just prior to the dawn of the Scottish Enlightenment. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of De viribus is the personal snippets related to Scottish Presbyterian morality that MacLaurin interjects throughout his mathematical discussion. These are often vague and oblique, and one must look to his mathematics, his contemporaries, and the social fabric of his surroundings to understand them. In the process, one gains insight not only into MacLaurin's family background and personal religious thought, but also into the culture and nature of teaching in Scottish universities at the time. De Viribus not only demonstrates that ideas of mathematising morality were being canvassed in Scotland much earlier than the better known, but less sophisticated, later attempts by the likes of Frances Hutcheson, David Hume and George Turnbull, but suggests continuities with approaches to mathematization in earlier centuries, providing a strong bridge into the Enlightenment era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Gauge Symmetry Breaking in the Abelian Higgs Mechanism</a><span class="id">[2504.17483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper aims to resolve the incompatibility between two extant gauge-invariant accounts of the Abelian Higgs mechanism: the first account uses global gauge symmetry breaking, and the second eliminates spontaneous symmetry breaking entirely. We resolve this incompatibility by using the constrained Hamiltonian formalism in symplectic geometry. First we argue that, unlike their local counterparts, global gauge symmetries are physical in the presence of boundary conditions. The symmetry that is spontaneously broken by the Higgs mechanism is this global one. Second, we explain how the Coulomb gauge is the preferred gauge for a gauge-invariant account of the Abelian Higgs mechanism. Based on the existence of the physical global gauge symmetry, we resolve the incompatibility between the two accounts by arguing that the correct way to carry out the second method is to eliminate only the redundant gauge symmetries, i.e. those local gauge symmetries which are not global. We extend our analysis to quantum field theory, where we show that the Abelian Higgs mechanism can be understood as spontaneous global $U(1)$ symmetry breaking in the $C^*$-algebraic sense.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14318" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Report on the Scoping Workshop on AI in Science Education Research 2025</a><span class="id">[2511.14318]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This report summarizes the outcomes of a two-day international scoping workshop on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in science education research. As AI rapidly reshapes scientific practice, classroom learning, and research methods, the field faces both new opportunities and significant challenges. The report clarifies key AI concepts to reduce ambiguity and reviews evidence of how AI influences scientific work, teaching practices, and disciplinary learning. It identifies how AI intersects with major areas of science education research, including curriculum development, assessment, epistemic cognition, inclusion, and teacher professional development, highlighting cases where AI can support human reasoning and cases where it may introduce risks to equity or validity. The report also examines how AI is transforming methodological approaches across quantitative, qualitative, ethnographic, and design-based traditions, giving rise to hybrid forms of analysis that combine human and computational strengths. To guide responsible integration, a systems-thinking heuristic is introduced that helps researchers consider stakeholder needs, potential risks, and ethical constraints. The report concludes with actionable recommendations for training, infrastructure, and standards, along with guidance for funders, policymakers, professional organizations, and academic departments. The goal is to support principled and methodologically sound use of AI in science education research.</p></div></details></article></body>
