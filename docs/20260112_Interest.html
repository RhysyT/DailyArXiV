<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remarkable Dates and Place: One Hundred Years Ago</a><span class="id">[2601.05337]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exactly a century ago, wave quantum mechanics was born in Arosa, Switzerland. Erwin Schrödinger was vacationing in this classic Swiss Alps town at Christmas 1925 when he made his breakthrough discovery of the wave equation \cite{SchrQMI}.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is emergence, after all?</a><span class="id">[2507.04951]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparative analysis of real experiments and digital (ICT) simulations regarding their impact on student learning</a><span class="id">[2601.05433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study, conducted among more than 250 physics and chemistry teachers in Morocco, analyzes the impact of experimentation on student learning and attention in middle and high school. The results show that the majority of teachers favor digital simulations, except for simple experiments such as electrical circuits. This choice is linked to material constraints, class size, and safety requirements. Simulations are perceived as practical and flexible, allowing experiments to be repeated or slowed down to facilitate understanding. However, teachers emphasize the need for specific ICT training in order to better integrate these tools into their practices. The most effective strategy identified is based on a hybrid approach: using simulations to explain abstract phenomena and real experiments to develop experimental skills, methodological rigor, and critical thinking. This complementary approach appears to be a promising solution for enriching science education and overcoming the constraints encountered in schools.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A computational and pedagogical framework for projectile motion using Python visualizations</a><span class="id">[2601.05769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Projectile motion is one of the most fundamental problems in introductory physics, offering a clear context to connect algebraic reasoning with conceptual understanding. This work presents a computational and pedagogical framework that combines the analytical formulation of projectile motion with interactive visualizations developed in Python. Using reproducible simulations, the dependence of the maximum height and horizontal range on the launch parameters $(v_0,\theta)$ is examined through trajectory plots, parameter-space maps, and iso-curves. These visual representations reveal non-trivial combinations of initial conditions that yield equivalent outcomes, reinforcing physical intuition and providing an accessible open-source tool for teaching and learning classical mechanics.</p></div></details></article></body>
