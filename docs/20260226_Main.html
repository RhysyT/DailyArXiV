Recent work predicts a continuum of such products, from fully stripped hot subdwarfs to partially stripped horizontal branch and red clump stars, and suggests that young, metal-rich RR Lyrae can form when partial stripping leaves a helium-burning star in the instability strip. To enable direct comparison with observations, we model these binaries in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy with a realistic metallicity-dependent star formation history and 3D dust map, generate epoch astrometry using Gaia's scanning law, and fit it with the cascade of astrometric models applied in Gaia DR3. We compare the simulated population to DR3 observations of hot subdwarfs, RR Lyrae, and red giants with high astrometric mass functions. The model significantly overpredicts the number of hot subdwarfs with astrometric binary solutions, partly because the predicted flux ratios are more unequal than observed. It also predicts $\gtrsim 100$ RR Lyrae with DR3 astrometric orbital solutions, while none are observed. We conclude that RR Lyrae in au-scale binaries may be substantially rarer than predicted. In contrast, the model plausibly explains the population of red clump stars with high astrometric mass functions, which we interpret as potential black hole impostors. We predict that $\sim 10 \times$ more stripped-star binaries will be detectable in DR4, whose sensitivity to longer periods will more strongly test wide-orbit systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Monster Shocks in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</a><span class="id">[2602.21290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Waves launched from the neutron star surface or inner magnetosphere propagate through the magnetosphere as small perturbations, but can grow relative to the background magnetic field and steepen into “monster shocks” – ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks which can power high-energy emission from magnetars, neutron star mergers and collapse. They occur in magnetically dominated plasma and are described by relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We present global relativistic MHD simulations of monster shocks in unperturbed and perturbed (“wrinkled”) backgrounds with a global dipolar geometry. Our simulations confirm analytical predictions for equatorial shocks and provide new insight into the behavior of oblique shocks off the equator. Simulations where the shock is formed through Alfvén mode to fast mode conversion are also presented, demonstrating the generic nature of the monster shock mechanism. We explore how the presence of additional modes in the magnetosphere modifies the shock behavior. Modes of comparable amplitude can fragment the shock front, substantially reduce the magnetization, produce localized enhancements in the Lorentz factor relative to an unperturbed dipole background, and intermittently generate additional shocks along a line of sight.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collapse of Magnetized White Dwarfs as site of Heavy Element Formation and Kilonova Signal</a><span class="id">[2602.21291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first end-to-end calculation connecting the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a magnetized, rapidly rotating white dwarf to observable kilonova signatures, combining 2D general-relativistic neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, followed by radiation hydrodynamics with in-situ nuclear network and 2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer with spatially resolved heating rates. Unlike all previous unmagnetized AIC models - which predicted proton-rich, $^{56}$Ni-dominated ejecta - strong magnetic fields eject ${\sim 0.2 M_\odot}$ of neutron-rich material $(\langle Y_e \rangle \sim 0.24)$ on dynamical timescales, before neutrino irradiation can raise the electron fraction, enabling strong $r$-process nucleosynthesis up to and beyond the third peak. The resulting kilonova is lanthanide-rich $(X_{\rm lan} \approx 6\%)$ and dominated by near-infrared emission. We compute synthetic light curves in the LSST and JWST bands and find striking agreement, without parameter tuning, between the observations of AT 2023vfi/GRB 230307A and our broadband light curves for polar viewing angles. These results establish magnetized AIC as a viable channel for heavy $r$-process element production and a compelling progenitor candidate for long-duration gamma-ray bursts with kilonova signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shock-induced chiral magnetic effect</a><span class="id">[2602.21294]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak-interaction-mediated chiral imbalance generation in idealized massless electrons during core-collapse supernovae was once proposed to be the source of strong magnetic fields found in neutron stars. The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications for PBH Dark Matter from a single Sub-Solar$\unicode{x2013}$GW Detection in LVK O1$\unicode{x2013}$O4</a><span class="id">[2602.21295]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of sub-solar mass black holes is a milestone of modern astrophysics as it would open a window either onto new stellar physics or could potentially unveil the nature of Dark Matter as Primordial Black Holes. On November 12, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration reported the compact binary merger candidate S251112cm, a system with no obvious EM counterpart, consistent with binary black hole merger with a chirp mass in the range $0.1-0.87 \, M_\odot$. The probability that at least one component has mass $&lt;$1 $M_{\odot}$ is $&gt;99\%$. Inspired by this trigger, we tested if a population of PBHs formed at Quantum Chromodynamics epoch with a broad mass function could account for a signal of this type. Our results, corresponding to a predicted event rate of $0.8 \,\text{yr}^{-1}$ as seen by LVK O3b, suggest that the observed merger rate of $0.23^{+0.86}_{-0.218}\,\text{yr}^{-1}\;(95\%\;\text{C.L.})$ if the trigger is confirmed as an astrophysical event would be compatible with such a model. Our predicted detection rate is also in agreement with current LVK expectations for stellar-mass binaries, remaining consistent with a scenario in which a non-negligible fraction of the $3-200 \;M_\odot$ mergers observed by LVK originate from Primordial Black Holes. If confirmed, this detection would place a lower limit to the PBH abundance $f_{PBH}&gt;0.04$ for our adopted model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rattle-and-Break: the Impact of Planetesimal Scattering on Super-Earth Resonant Chains</a><span class="id">[2602.21349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spacings of super-Earths in multi-transiting systems exhibit a distribution that is broad and mostly featureless, with the exception of notable excesses of planet pairs situated a few percent wide of first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this work, we extend the so-called &quot;breaking-the-chains&quot; model to account for both of these characteristics. Assuming that super-Earths are settled into stable chains of resonances after disk-driven migration, we show that scattering a planetesimal population that contains only a few percent of a system's mass can reorganize primordial chains in remarkable ways. The planetesimal scattering &quot;rattles&quot; the chains by repelling adjacent planet pairs wide of their initial MMRs. Some chains remain rattled but otherwise intact and make up the observed excesses wide of MMRs. In other systems, however, this initial rattling sows the seeds of later orbital instabilities that break the chains entirely. If individual planetesimals' masses are of order a Pluto mass or so, the onset of these instabilities can occur tens or hundreds of Myr after birth, naturally explaining the apparent disappearance of near-resonant pairs on this timescale. The origin of such Pluto-mass debris is currently unknown.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of Water-rich Giant Planet Satellites at Decretion Disk Ice Lines</a><span class="id">[2602.21400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The volatile budgets of giant planet satellites are critical to unraveling the origin of their building blocks within the circumplanetary disks that hosted them. The Galilean moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as the Saturnian moon Titan, are known to be anomalously water rich on the basis of their mean densities and interior models informed by gravity data from Galileo and Cassini, characterized by ice-to-rock ratios around unity. Here, we show that the water-ice sublimation line in a decreting circumplanetary disk lends itself to the formation of a water-rich solid reservoir, serving as a natural site for the birthplace of icy satellites. Fundamentally, this reflects how interior to the ice line, water vapor is advected outward, while beyond it, water ice drifts inward as pebbles. Using a semi-analytic model for dust and vapor evolution, we simulate vapor and ice accumulation at the ice line, showing that solids just beyond it achieve steady-state ice-to-rock ratios a factor of a few higher than elsewhere in the disk. For typical disk parameters, this ice buildup occurs within a timescale of a few thousand years. We propose this as a first-order process that explains, at least to some extent, the compositions of three aforementioned satellites. We explore the impact of uncertain turbulence parameters on our results, namely the turbulent Schmidt number and Shakura-Sunyaev alpha, before discussing them in the context of icy satellite D/H ratios. We conclude by evaluating alternative scenarios for explaining water-rich satellites, based on the conversion of CO to CH4, with water as a by-product.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complex Analysis of Askaryan Radiation: UHE-$ν$ Identification and Reconstruction using the Hilbert Envelope of Observed Signals</a><span class="id">[2602.21412]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$\nu$), with enegies above 10 PeV, has been a long-time goal in astroparticle physics. Autonomous, radio-frequency (RF) UHE-$\nu$ detetectors have been deployed in polar regions that rely on the Askaryan effect in ice for the neutrino signal. The Askaryan effect occurs when the excess negative charge within a UHE-$\nu$ cascade radiates in a dense medium. UHE-$\nu$ can induce cascades that radiate in the RF bandwidth above thermal backgrounds. To identify UHE-$\nu$ signals in data from Askaryan-class detectors, analytic models of the Askaryan electromagnetic field have been created and matched to simulations and laboratory measurements. These models describe the Askaryan electromagnetic field, but leave the effects of signal propagation through polar ice and RF channel response to simulations. In this work, a fully analytic Askaryan model that accounts for these effects is presented. First, formulas for the observed voltage trace and its Hilbert envelope are calculated. Second, the analytic model is compared to UHE-$\nu$ signals at 100 PeV from NuRadioMC, a key Monte Carlo toolset in the field. Correlation coefficients between the analytic signal envelope and MC data in excess of $0.94$ are found, and 99.99% of UHE-$\nu$ signals pass a correlation threshold of $\rho\geq 0.4$. Analysis of RF thermal noise reveals that just 0.2 background events have $\rho\geq 0.4$ in 5 years at a 1 Hz thermal trigger rate. Finally, we describe future work related to the measurement of the logarithm of the UHE-$\nu$ cascade energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibration of the [C/N] and [Y/Mg] chemical clocks with asteroseismic ages from the TESS space mission</a><span class="id">[2602.21413]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Stellar ages are typically very difficult to estimate for field stars. New empirical methods, based on abundance ratios of chemical elements, are emerging and need to be calibrated. Aims. Our main aim is to contribute to revealing relations between [C/N] and [Y/Mg] ratios and stellar ages by determining astroseismic ages and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances, and accounting for stellar evolutionary stages and birth places in the Galaxy. Methods. We searched for solar pulsations in a sample of 1250 bright F, G, and K giants using data from the TESS space telescope and determined asteroseismic ages using the BASTA and PARAM codes. For the [Y/Mg] relations with age, we determined abundances accounting for deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. For the [C/N] relations with age, we separated stars according to their evolutionary stages. Results. We determined asteroseismic ages for 218 giants and derived [Y/Mg] and [C/N] relations with age for subsamples of stars in three regions of the Galactic thin disc and the thick disc. Conclusions. The [Y/Mg]-age relation exhibits a clear radial dependence across the Galactic disc, with a steeper trend in the outer disc, progressively flatter relations towards the inner disc, and a very flat trend in the thick disc. NLTE abundances of Mg and especially of Y have to be used in order to obtain a more precise stellar age evaluation from [Y/Mg] ratios. When using [C/N] abundance ratios as stellar age indicators, evolutionary stages of stars have to be taken into account.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Importance of the Convective Urca Process in 3D Simulations of a Simmering White Dwarf</a><span class="id">[2602.21440]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae are bright thermonuclear explosions that are important to numerous areas of astronomy. However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intracluster Medium Fluctuations on Scales up to 1 Mpc: A Combined eROSITA and SPT/Planck Analysis of Abell 3266</a><span class="id">[2602.21443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters form through hierarchical assembly, where smaller substructures merge to build the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resurgence and Hyperasymptotics in Wave Optics Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2602.21493]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the discovery of gravitational waves and fast radio bursts, wave optics has become increasingly relevant in astrophysics. This paper studies the behaviour of random gravitational and plasma lenses, presenting the refractive and diffractive expansions, with higher-order terms that allow error estimates and embody the counterintuitive resurgence phenomenon. Specifically, we show that the diffractive expansion converges for a broad class of bounded lens models and provides an efficient description of interference patterns across frequency regimes. Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics. Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate. We use the leading uniform approximation to derive the strong wave optics suppression of off-axis caustics, which clarifies their subdominant role.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Short-duration GRB 250221A Afterglow Driven by Two-Component Jets from merger of compact star</a><span class="id">[2602.21516]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250221A is a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift $z=0.768$, with a duration of 1.8 s and no extended emission in either Swift/BAT or Konus-Wind bands. A remarkable re-brightening feature in both optical and X-ray bands was observed at $\sim 0.6$ days after the burst trigger, but no supernova or kilonova signature was detected. The burst properties and empirical correlations or distributions (e.g., duration, spectral hardness, location in the Amati correlation, $\varepsilon-$value, $f_{\rm eff}$ parameter, and physical offset) favor a compact binary merger origin. However, a dense circumburst medium with $n\sim 80\rm~cm^{-3}$, obtained by adopting the energy injection into a jet to interpret the late-time re-brightening is inconsistent with the compact binary merger origin. In this paper, we propose a two-component jet model to explain the multiwavelength afterglow observations of GRB 250221A, in which the relativistic narrow jet ($\rm \theta_{c} \sim 3.8^\circ$) produces the prompt and the early decay afterglow emission, while the mildly relativistic wide jet ($\rm \theta_{w} \sim 4.4^\circ$) dominates at later times, resulting in the observed re-brightening feature. If this is the case, one can obtain a lower medium density with $n\sim 0.72\rm~cm^{-3}$ which is a little bit higher than that of short GRBs in merger environments, but falls into the reasonable and acceptable range. Finally, a possible kilonova emission is also discussed within the scenario of compact star merger origin of GRB 250221A.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on neutrino emission and hadronic flux from 1LHAASO catalog $γ$-ray sources</a><span class="id">[2602.21542]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>IceCube has detected neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane (GP) at a significance of $4.5\sigma$, though its origin remains uncertain. Utilizing ten years of IceCube muon-track data, we investigate potential correlations between the GP neutrinos and $\gamma$-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog (1LHAASO). To avoid issues caused by spectral extrapolation, this analysis focuses on sources detected by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We employ an unbinned likelihood analysis to search for neutrino emission and constrain the hadronic $\gamma$-ray component of these sources. Neither single-source searches nor stacking analyses reveal significant neutrino signals. The stacking analysis indicates that the 1LHAASO WCDA population contributes at most $\sim$20\% to the diffuse GP neutrino flux measured by IceCube. The total hadronic contribution to the cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from all WCDA sources is constrained to be at most $\sim$$60\%$, suggesting a predominantly leptonic origin for the $\gamma$-ray emission from the LHAASO source population. Even accounting for unresolved sources below the detection threshold, we estimate the total neutrino flux from all discrete sources (resolved plus unresolved) reaches at most about 40\% of the observed GP neutrino flux. These results support that the bulk of the GP neutrino emission is mainly from truly diffuse processes, i.e., cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium, rather than from unresolved point sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21624" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT2024lhc and AT2024kmq in the landscape of featureless tidal disruption events</a><span class="id">[2602.21624]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study AT2024kmq and AT2024lhc, two tidal disruption events (TDEs) with blue featureless spectra associated with high-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8\,M_\odot$). Both events show optical precursors consistent with shock dissipation from stream self-intersection. Their X-ray emission is luminous ($L_{\rm X}\sim 10^{44}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$), highly variable (with minimum observed variability timescales of 1.3 hr and 4.8 hr for factor of $\sim3$ flux changes), long-lasting ($&gt;1\,\rm yr$), emerging no later than the optical peak, and well characterized by power-laws with $1.7&lt;\Gamma&lt;3$ (where $f_\nu \propto \nu^{1-\Gamma}$). The X-ray properties and radio non-detections support a compact corona ($\lesssim 10 r_{\rm g}$) producing Comptonized X-ray emission. Using all published featureless TDEs, we find statistically significant bimodality in the distribution of their peak UV/optical blackbody luminosities and radii. We assemble a comparison TDE sample with early-time X-ray observations with eROSITA, in which we find different $M_{\rm BH}$ distributions in TDEs with different X-ray spectral evolution properties: low-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) remain soft ($\Gamma&gt;4$) within $t\lesssim 2$ yr, intermediate masses ($\sim 10^7 M_\odot$) transition from soft to hard at $\sim$1 yr, while high masses ($\sim 10^8 M_\odot$) are hard ($1.5&lt;\Gamma\lesssim 3$) from the outset. We interpret this result as evidence that the soft-to-hard state transition in TDEs occurs at the critical threshold of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc} \sim 0.03 \dot M_{\rm Edd}$ (similar to X-ray binaries), using the fact that the transition timescale predicted by simple disk theory scales with black hole mass as $t_{\rm tr}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-3/4}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$r$-mode stabilization in rotating hyperon-rich neutron stars and its implications for GW190814</a><span class="id">[2602.21651]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The GW190814 event, involving a black hole of mass $22.2$–$24.3 M_{\odot}$ and a compact object of mass $2.50$–$2.67 M_{\odot}$, challenges our understanding of the mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes. If the secondary is a neutron star exceeding $2.5 M_{\odot}$, hyperons are likely to appear in its core, softening the equation of state. Rapid rotation can offset some of this softening, enabling higher maximum masses, but it may simultaneously excite the Chandrasekhar–Friedman–Schutz $r$-mode instability. Bulk viscosity arising from nonleptonic weak interactions in hyperonic matter provides an efficient damping mechanism that can stabilize such configurations. In this work, we investigate the combined effects of rotation, thermal evolution, and hyperon-induced bulk viscosity on the stability of massive neutron stars. We demonstrate a direct connection between the suppression of $r$-mode instabilities and the long-term dynamical stability of hyperon-rich stars, offering a plausible interpretation of the GW190814 secondary as a rapidly rotating, hyperon-rich neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole. Our unified framework extends beyond previous studies restricted to static equations of state or extreme viscous damping assumptions, providing new insights into the stability of massive, exotic neutron star configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21661" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral and photometric variability of SS 433 observed with XRISM and simultaneous optical and near-infrared telescopes</a><span class="id">[2602.21661]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from coordinated multiwavelength observations of the SS 433, obtained with XRISM, optical telescopes, and near-infrared camera during 2024 April and 2025 March. The XRISM exposures amounted to  200 ks in 2024 and  100 ks in 2025. With XRISM/Resolve's high spectral resolution and large effective area, we clearly resolved numerous emission lines even in short time segments, achieving improved accuracy in Doppler-shift measurements relative to earlier observations. The simultaneously obtained X-ray and optical Doppler shifts suggest a possible tendency for the optical emission to lag slightly behind the X-rays. In the Resolve data, the Doppler shifts of the two jet components exhibited apparent asymmetries, with jet speeds fluctuating around  0.26$\pm$0.01$c$ in 2024 and  0.30$\pm$0.01$c$ in 2025. The velocity variations indicated modulations on a timescale of  6.3 d, with a phase offset of about -90$^{\circ}$ relative to the nutation cycle. The observed line widths and flux of the approaching and receding jets appear consistent with the expected geometrical effects, indicating systematically larger line widths in the inner regions of the jets, as proposed by Shidatsu et al. (2025). Optical light curves show flares of  400 s in 2024 and  1600 s in 2025, with amplitudes up to  15% during out-of-eclipse intervals, while the XRISM/Xtend light curves show no significant variability within the overlapping intervals and given the statistical uncertainties. Near-infrared photometry in 2024, obtained during an out-of-eclipse interval at a different epoch from the optical observations, showed no flare-like variability, and the X-ray band also remained constant within uncertainties. These coordinated observations provide a foundation for future XRISM studies aimed at probing the dynamical properties of the relativistic jets in SS 433.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21683" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Retarded Stellar Dynamo in Tidally Deformed M Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2602.21683]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current studies of stellar dynamos primarily focus on spherical stars, leaving their behavior in distorted stars largely unexplored. We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries. Our numerical simulations further reveal that, the thermal convection weakens in highly distorted stars, and subsequently, the differential rotation is also reduced. These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\rm cyc}$-$P_{\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Mira B a low mass white dwarf?</a><span class="id">[2602.21725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report photometric observations in Johnson B and V bands of the short term variability (flickering) of Mira (omicron Ceti).

The observed peak-to-peak amplitude of the flickering is 0.11-0.28 mag in B band. For the flickering source we find luminosity in the range 0.10-0.46 L_sun. Using the amplitude-flux relation, we estimate an average luminosity of the accretion disc L_d = 0.91 +/- 0.28 L_sun. Assuming that the white dwarf accretes material through Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLOF), we find that Mira B is a low mass white dwarf with M_wd = 0.24 +/- 0.04 M_sun accreting at a rate 6.8x10^{-9} M_sun/yr.

High-cadence photometry of flares provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of these events, yet such observations remain scarce. We seek to explore the sub-second fine structure of stellar flares and assess the information content in high-speed photometry. New 0.3 s-cadence photometry from a six-year-long observing campaign of the active M-dwarf AD Leo is presented. We use time–frequency analysis to detect quasi-periodic pulsations in the decay phase of flares. We explore statistical measures of time series complexity of the detected flares to quantify the information gain achievable with high-cadence photometry. We detect 42 flares in 211 hours of observations. The flare frequency distribution is consistent with the previous literature. We find no quasi-periodic pulsations with periods below a few seconds, and identify two candidate signals with periods around 1 and 3 min. Using different measures of complexity on the binned flare light curves we confirm the advantages of high observing cadence. However, we also find a plateau up to a binning of  4–5 s for a few complex flares, suggesting that an exposure time of a few seconds is usually enough to retain most of the information carried by a single-filter observation. New photometric observations of AD Leo revealed sub-structures of flare light curves on the timescale of a few seconds, but we found no features on timescales below that.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A sound horizon independent measurement of $H_0$ from BOSS, DESI and DES Y3</a><span class="id">[2602.21733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a sound horizon independent measurement of the Hubble parameter using a multiprobe large-scale structure analysis.

We combine this analysis with the auto- and cross-angular power spectra from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR9, the $3 \times 2$pt analysis from DES Y3, and the CMB gravitational lensing power spectrum from Planck PR3. Our baseline analysis, that does not rely on supernovae data, yields $h = 0.702^{+0.022}_{-0.024}$, $\Omega_m = 0.310 \pm 0.013$, and $\sigma_8 = 0.799 \pm 0.020$, corresponding to $3-4 \%$ precision measurements. When adding supernovae data from Pantheon+, we obtain a $2.6 \%$ measurement of $h$, with $h = 0.686 \pm 0.018$. We further note that our EFTBOSS analysis indicates a slight deviation of the BAO scale parameter (at $1.8 \sigma$) from its $\Lambda$CDM value, caused by the small scales of the bispectrum.

We derive the full field equations, the exact dark-sector exchange structure, and the linear scalar-perturbation system in gauge-ready form. In the sub-horizon regime, we derive effective modified-gravity functions governing structure growth and light deflection, and show that the model generically produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in growth and lensing observables. Building on this structure, we formulate a perturbation-focused multi-probe framework based on redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and CMB lensing, explicitly targeting degeneracy breaking beyond background-expansion tests. The analysis establishes the action-level and perturbation-level foundations of the model and provides a conservative, reproducible framework for translated linear-regime constraints within a dark-sector selective modified-gravity setting.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The accretion discs in WZ Sge-type stars in deep quiescence.

Within the disc instability model (DIM), such events are explained as being triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor star. We present an analysis of observations of a sample of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence to assess the consistency of DIM predictions with their observed properties. We find that accretion discs in quiescent WZ Sge-type systems have very low mass-accretion rates of a few $\times$$10^{-13}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The discs are entirely optically thin, and their physical conditions – such as surface density and effective temperature – remain well below the DIM thresholds required to trigger an outburst. Observationally, no increase in disc brightness is detected prior to the superoutburst, indicating the absence of a transition to an optically thick state, in contrast to DIM predictions of a gradual disc thickening preceding the instability. We therefore find no observational evidence that superoutbursts in WZ Sge-type systems are triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor. Furthermore, the inferred mass-transfer rates in these objects ($\dot{M}_{\rm tr}$ 5$\times$$10^{-12}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are at least an order of magnitude lower than commonly assumed. We argue that the widely adopted value of $\dot{M}_{\rm tr}$ for the prototype object WZ Sge is likely overestimated. Finally, we show that in quiescence the accretion disc radius in all systems is close to the tidal truncation radius and exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius, confirming earlier results and calling into question the standard interpretation of superhump formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact and interplay of $Λ$CDM analysis choices for LSST cosmic shear</a><span class="id">[2602.21863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We forecast cosmological parameter constraints for a cosmic shear analysis of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), defining an analysis framework that can accurately recover the $\Lambda$CDM model in the presence of astrophysical and data-related systematics. When accounting for our present uncertainty on the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum through baryon feedback, we find that the error on the composite parameter $S_8=\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ almost doubles compared to an LSST analysis which neglects this astrophysical phenomenon. After the first year of observations, LSST will extend beyond the magnitude limit of existing representative spectroscopic calibration samples, requiring photometric redshifts to be calibrated using an alternative strategy. Adopting literature measurements of the reduced redshift calibration precision found from galaxy cross-correlation techniques, combined with current levels of baryon feedback uncertainty, we forecast final year LSST cosmic shear constraints that barely improve upon the first year analysis. This forecast therefore serves as encouragement to the community to develop methodology and observations to constrain models of baryon feedback and enhance photometric redshift calibration at depths where spectroscopy is unrepresentative. With tight priors on both these systematic terms, we forecast that LSST cosmic shear can deliver constraints on $S_8$ that are more than five times as constraining as existing cosmic shear surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal disruptions of rubble piles: The case of Phobos</a><span class="id">[2602.21912]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many small satellites in the Solar System have sub-synchronous orbits, meaning their orbits are decaying due to tidal dissipation. Unless they have substantial material strength, they will eventually tidally disrupt before reaching their planet's surface. We studied the fate of rubble-pile satellites as they migrate inward, with a particular focus on the case of Phobos. We used a combination of analytic estimates and numerical simulations to determine the failure mode and tidal disruption distance of a Phobos-like satellite, as a function of its shape and cohesive strength. Both analytically and numerically, we identify a regime for satellites with low cohesive strengths whereby their surface can be tidally stripped without undergoing internal failure. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that Phobos will be destroyed beyond 2 Mars radii if it has a bulk strength similar to those estimated for small bodies recently visited by spacecraft. Based on our results and some additional arguments, we suggest that previous studies on the fate of Phobos have overestimated its strength, and therefore underestimated its tidal disruption distance. We also speculate that if Phobos undergoes some tidal stripping, its ultimate fate may be determined by runaway collisional erosion rather than a pure tidal disruption. However, the ultimate tidal disruption distance for Phobos will depend on its unknown internal structure and bulk material properties, which will be constrained by JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission and its IDEFIX rover. These results have implications for theories about the origin and evolution of the Martian moons and for tidal disruptions of other small, irregularly shaped satellites.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Dark Photon Dark Matter with CTAO</a><span class="id">[2602.21920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dark photon is a new hypothetical gauge boson arising in extensions of the Standard Model, and constitutes a compelling dark matter candidate. As dark photon dark matter (DPDM), it can interact with electromagnetic fields via kinetic mixing, and the inelastic scattering process $\gamma \gamma' \to e^+ e^-$ becomes kinematically allowed for gamma rays above a characteristic energy threshold. This interaction imprints unique spectral attenuation features at very-high-energies (VHE), offering an observational probe of DPDM models. Using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) Instrument Response Functions (IRFs), we simulate observations of VHE sources and forecast novel sensitivities to the kinetic mixing parameter for the photon-dark photon scattering process. Our study focuses on three key astrophysical targets: the Crab Nebula and the blazars Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dark matter spikes around black holes on the upper limits. Our results demonstrate that CTAO can probe the DPDM parameter space down to a mixing parameter of $\varepsilon \sim 10^{-8}$ for masses around $m_{A^{\prime}} \sim 10^{-1}~\textrm{eV}$ through high-energy spectral attenuation, at a $95\%$ confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How does a MOND cosmology fare on Gpc scales? - Collisionless $N$-body simulations of $ν$HDM</a><span class="id">[2602.21975]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the largest collisionless $N$-body cosmological simulations in a MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) cosmology to date.

We test its viability on cosmological scales using simulations with $256^{3}$ particles in a box of size $800/h$ comoving Mpc. We find generically that the MOND models massively overproduce large-scale structures by $z=0$, with a most massive cluster in $\nu$HDM of $\approx 5 \times 10^{17} M_{\odot}/h$ and typical peculiar velocities of several thousand km/s. We also explore a local void solution to the Hubble tension in these models. Analogues to the observed &quot;Local Hole” do form in the MOND models, but values for the deceleration parameter $&lt;-1.5$ in these regions prevent a satisfactory resolution to the Hubble tension. Whilst $\Lambda$CDM significantly underpredicts the observed bulk flow in Cosmicflows-4, the high peculiar velocities that arise in the MOND models create the opposite problem, ruling out $\nu$HDM at $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence. Observations clearly require a much milder enhancement to the rate of structure growth in $\Lambda$CDM than is provided by the $\nu$HDM paradigm. Our results also suggest that replacing cold dark matter with hot dark matter is unlikely to provide a viable cosmological model, regardless of the gravity law.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22007" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectroscopic study of five Mira stars</a><span class="id">[2602.22007]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mira stars are popular with amateur astronomers because they are generally bright and their pulsations produce large changes in brightness.

Jansky VLA observations together with X-ray constraints from Swift/XRT and NICER. The radio light curves show two distinct episodes, with the L-band peaks separated by $\approx1513$ days. Modeling the second episode with a synchrotron afterglow framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting favors a non-relativistic outflow $v\simeq0.03c$, with an isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of order $10^{50}$ erg propagating in an approximately constant-density circumnuclear medium. No significant contemporaneous brightening is detected by Swift/XRT during the 2016 radio flare, while faint NICER flares in 2023 suggest intermittent low-level accretion.

We quantify the fraction of surviving disks across $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, track the evolution of gas disk mass and size, and compare our results with observations of protoplanetary disks in the Upper Scorpius region, including the ten targets studied by the AGE-PRO ALMA Large Program. We find that models combining viscous evolution with external photoevaporation yield disk lifetimes of $3\text{-}7\,\mathrm{Myr}$, consistent with observed dispersal timescales, particularly for $10^{-4} \leq \alpha \leq 10^{-2}$. Low-mass stars ($0.1\,$M$_\odot$) are more susceptible to disk dispersal due to their weaker gravitational binding, with their fraction among all surviving disks dropping from $76\%$ at birth to $51\%$ by $10\,\mathrm{Myr}$. The majority of the long-lived disks are those with low viscosity $\alpha &lt; 10^{-3.5}$ and initial characteristic radius $R_c &lt; 125\,\mathrm{AU}$, while the initial disk-to-star mass ratio does not play an important role. The median gas disk mass and radius of the surviving disks exhibit a sharp decline in the first $0.2\,\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, followed by a slight increase that reflects survivorship bias. We also explore correlations between gas disk mass and size vs. stellar mass and FUV strength.

The simulated accretion flow behaves remarkably similarly to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime of ideal MHD, reproducing episodes of magnetic flux saturation and eruption typical of MADs.

These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures. This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $\beta$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $\beta$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">INFLAVON: CMB as cosmic tracer of Flavor physics</a><span class="id">[2602.20257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We unify one of the most widely studied frameworks to explain the hierarchical structure of the flavor sector in the Standard Model, the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, with cosmic inflation.

While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direction-of-arrival estimation of a gravitational wave by correlations between quadrupole moments of pulsar timings</a><span class="id">[2602.21607]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Can we estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from pulsar timing array observations? The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21675" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Kalb-Ramond field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</a><span class="id">[2602.21675]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider a massive Kalb-Ramond field with a general non-minimal coupling to gravity.

We show that the coupling with the Ricci scalar gives rise to the strong coupling of the two transverse pseudo-vector degrees of freedom, which are absent in the massless theory. We then show that if the theory is instead coupled to the Ricci tensor or the Riemann tensor, the two tensor modes become strongly coupled in addition to the transverse pseudo-vector modes. We then extend our analysis to homogeneous and isotropic space-time, with vanishing background value of the Kalb-Ramond field. We show that in this case, the couplings with the Ricci and Riemann tensor give rise to the runaway instability. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of the disformal coupling as a possible resolution to this unnatural behavior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analytic force-free jet from disk-fed rotating black holes</a><span class="id">[2602.21865]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new analytic model of force-free electromagnetic jet launched from a disk-fed rotating black hole.

Given a discrete ordinates discretization, we report the corresponding matrix structures, depending on model and discretization parameters. Despite the possibly dense nature of these matrices, the use of Krylov methods is effective (especially in the matrix-free context) and robust. We propose a theoretical analysis, using the spectral tools of the symbol theory, explaining why Krylov convergence is robust w.r.t. all the discretization parameters, even in the unpreconditioned case. In fact, the compactness of the continuous operators used in the modeling leads to zero-clustered dense matrix sequences plus identity, so that the clustering at the unity of the spectra is deduced. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, which have a direct application, for example, in the simulation of radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres, a key problem in astrophysical research. In general, we demonstrate that optimal scaling with respect to RT discretization parameters is expected for Krylov solution strategies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22116" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Choice of Quantum Vacuum for Inflation Observables</a><span class="id">[2602.22116]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the modifications to inflationary observables that arise when adopting an $\alpha$-vacuum instead of the standard Bunch–Davies vacuum for quantum fluctuations during inflation.

We present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet ($M_p=1.08~\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf ($M_\star=0.392~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, $R_\star=0.394~\mathrm{R_\odot}$). We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. The data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted starspots and faculae is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths $\lambda\lesssim3.0$ um, reducing the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models and preventing detection of $\mathrm{H_2O}$. The wavelength coverage enabled a robust detection of $\mathrm{CH_4}$ and $\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um. For both clear or cloudy atmospheres, Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with sub-solar metallicity ($3\sigma$ upper limit of $\log\mathrm{[M/H]}\lesssim-1.24$) and super-solar C/O ratio ($3\sigma$ lower limit of $\log\mathrm{[C/O]}\gtrsim0.09$), although this may partly be driven by the non-detection of water due to stellar contamination. Planetary interior models predict a bulk metallicity of 10–20\%, which is larger than the atmospheric metallicity and suggests that the interior of TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A deep X-ray and UV look into the reflaring stage of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658</a><span class="id">[2506.19556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an X-ray and UV high-time-resolution monitoring of the final flaring phase of the 2022 outburst of the AMSP SAX J1808.4-3658, based on simultaneous XMM-Newton and HST observations. The uninterrupted coverage provided by XMM-Newton enabled a detailed characterization of the spectral and temporal evolution of the source X-ray emission, as the flux varied by approximately 1 order of magnitude. We detected coherent X-ray pulsations during the whole X-ray observation, down to a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of $L_{X(low)0.5-10} \simeq 6.21^{+0.20}_{-0.15}\times 10^{34} d^2_{3.5}erg/s$, among the lowest ever observed in this source. At the lowest flux levels, we observed significant variations in pulse amplitude and phase. These variations were anticorrelated with the X-ray source flux. We found a sharp phase jump of $\sim 0.4$ cycles, accompanied by a doubling of the pulse amplitude and a softening of the X-ray emission. We interpreted changes in the X-ray pulse profiles as drifts of emission regions on the neutron-star surface, driven by an increase in the inner-disk radius when the mass-accretion rate decreased. The dependence of the pulse phase on the X-ray flux was consistent with a magnetospheric radius scaling as $R_{m} \propto \dot{M}^{\Lambda}$, with $\Lambda = -0.17(9)$, in broad agreement with theoretical predictions. Simultaneous HST observations confirmed the presence of significant UV pulsations at an X-ray luminosity approximately a factor of two lower than during the 2019 outburst, extending the range of mass accretion rates at which UV pulsations have been detected. The measured pulsed UV luminosity, $L_{pulsed}^{UV}=1.1(3) \times 10^{32}erg/s$, was consistent with that observed during the 2019 outburst. Such a UV luminosity exceeds the predictions of standard emission models, as further confirmed by the shape of the pulsed spectral energy distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New bounds on Axion-Like Particles in the Ultraviolet from Legacy Data</a><span class="id">[2506.19962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use legacy data from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) to search for a spectral line from the spontaneous decay of axion-like particle (ALP) dark matter.

We explore the possibility of indirectly extracting the 21 cm signal in the presence of foregrounds by taking advantage of nonlinear couplings between large and small scales, both at the level of the density field and a biased tracer of that field. When combined with effective field theory techniques, bias expansions allow for a systematic treatment of nonlinear mode-couplings in the map between the underlying density field and the 21 cm field. We apply an effective bias expansion to density information generated with $\texttt{21cmFAST}$ using a variety of assumptions about which information can be recovered by different surveys and density estimation techniques. We find that the 21 cm signal produced by our effective bias expansion, combined with our least optimistic foreground assumptions, produces $\sim30\%$ cross-correlations with the true 21 cm field. Providing complementary density information from high-redshift galaxy surveys yields a cross-correlation of 50-70%. The techniques presented here may be combined with foreground mitigation strategies in order to improve the recovery of the large-scale 21 cm signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05187" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficient evaluation of the dark-matter two-loop power spectrum in the EFT of LSS</a><span class="id">[2509.05187]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapid progress in cosmological Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys motivates precise theoretical predictions. The Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) is routinely applied to data, and requires fast computation of its predictions when sampling the large space of cosmological parameters. Going beyond existing one-loop techniques, we present a method to rapidly evaluate the two-loop power spectrum. Our method decomposes the typically small difference between a given linear power spectrum and a reference power spectrum into a cosmology-independent basis of functions resembling massive scalar propagators in Quantum Field Theory. By taking the leading terms in such a small difference, we numerically evaluate the cosmology-independent loop integrals where in the integrand only the relevant combinations of basis functions appear. We achieve an efficient numerical evaluation via physically motivated local ultraviolet subtractions and by arranging the cancellation of infrared singularities locally in the integrands. Final predictions are obtained by contracting these precomputed integrals with the cosmology-dependent coordinates of the expansion in the fixed basis. We present and publicly release the precomputed integrals for the renormalized two-loop dark-matter power spectrum in the EFTofLSS. These require eight EFT counterterms, which include the effect of generated vorticity, and are sufficient to analyze the lensing galaxy signal in LSS surveys at this order.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CMB component-separated power spectrum estimation by Spectral Internal Linear Combination (SpILC)</a><span class="id">[2509.10604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Component separation methods mitigate the cross-contamination between different extragalactic and galactic contributions to cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. This is often done by linearly combining CMB maps from different frequency channels using internal linear combination (ILC) methods. We demonstrate that deriving power spectrum estimators directly by linearly combining auto- and cross-spectra instead of maps allows us to obtain a different constrained-optimization problem that allows fewer (deprojection) constraint equations than combining at map level using the constrained ILC method. Through simulations, we show that our Spectral internal linear combination (SpILC) produces CMB power spectrum estimators with more than 7 times smaller errorbars than constrained ILC (with thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich and cosmic infrared background deprojections) at $\ell\gtrsim 4000$ for Simons Observatory-like observations. Spectral ILC outperforms constrained ILC methods when some modeled components are spatially uncorrelated, e.g. the primary CMB is uncorrelated with foregrounds, and the difference in performance is most significant at noise-dominated scales. More generally, our work shows that component-separated maps with foreground deprojections do not necessarily produce minimum-variance two-or-higher-point estimators.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Dark Radiation to Dark Energy: Unified Cosmological Evolution in K-essence Models</a><span class="id">[2509.25088]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy.

All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\sim 4.4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3.4 \sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution.

We extend these simple models by including the gravitational influence of a spherically symmetric mass distribution representing either a dark matter halo or the broader galactic environment, rather than treating the disruption as an isolated star-black hole encounter. We retain a minimal, fully Newtonian setup so that the role of the host galaxy remains transparent and straightforward to interpret. Within this extended model, we find that the host potential can imprint clear signatures on the light curve that lie outside the predictive scope of traditional models, such as phases of shallow decay and episodes of late-time rebrightening. These environment-driven signatures, however, emerge only on very long timescales unless the host is unrealistically ultra-compact. For most real systems, the environmental influence turns on far too late to be captured by current observations, which explains why the early evolution of TDEs occurring in typical galaxies is essentially unaffected by the host potential and why the classic models have been so successful. Only at much longer times does the broader galactic structure begin to reshape the fallback dynamics, gradually steering the system away from the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ decay. This provides an exciting opportunity for next-generation time domain surveys to extend monitoring and track late-time TDE evolution in search of delayed signals that quietly encode information about the surrounding galactic mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Clustering-redshifts and importance sampling of Self-Organised-Maps $n(z)$ realizations for $3\times2$pt samples</a><span class="id">[2510.23565]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work is part of a series establishing the redshift framework for the $3\times2$pt analysis of the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 (DES Y6). For DES Y6, photometric redshift distributions are estimated using self-organizing maps (SOMs), calibrated with spectroscopic and many-band photometric data. To overcome limitations from color-redshift degeneracies and incomplete spectroscopic coverage, we enhance this approach by incorporating clustering-based redshift constraints (clustering-z, or WZ) from angular cross-correlations with BOSS and eBOSS galaxies, and eBOSS quasar samples. We define a WZ likelihood and apply importance sampling to a large ensemble of SOM-derived $n(z)$ realizations, selecting those consistent with the clustering measurements to produce a posterior sample for each lens and source bin. The analysis uses angular scales of 1.5-5 Mpc to optimize signal-to-noise while mitigating modeling uncertainties, and marginalizes over redshift-dependent galaxy bias and other systematics informed by the N-body simulation Cardinal. While a sparser spectroscopic reference sample limits WZ constraining power at $z&gt;1.1$, particularly for source bins, we demonstrate that combining SOMPZ with WZ improves redshift accuracy and enhances the overall cosmological constraining power of DES Y6. We estimate an improvement in $S_8$ of approximately 10\% for cosmic shear and $3\times2$pt analysis, primarily due to the WZ calibration of the source samples.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unbiased Primordial Gravitational Wave Inference from the CMB with SMICA</a><span class="id">[2510.26767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detection of primordial gravitational waves in Cosmic Microwave Background B-mode polarization observations requires accurate and robust subtraction of astrophysical contamination.

It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at $(3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P Cygni He I lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C III, N III, and He II. The P Cygni He I features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. Our multi-band light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ M$_\odot$ with a kinetic energy of $E_{\rm k} = 0.06^{+0.01}_{-0.01} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.018$ M$_\odot$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm CSM} = 0.51^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$, an inner radius of $R_0 = 17.8^{+3.6}_{-3.0}$ AU, and a density of $\rho_{\rm CSM} =(8.3_{-1.2}^{+2.7})\times10^{-12}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/he4p0 model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4 M$_\odot$ (H-ZAMS mass 18.11 M$_\odot$, pre-SN mass 3.16 M$_\odot$). These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01082" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relationship Between Major Stellar Physical Parameters and Normal Mode Frequencies in Accreting White Dwarf Stars</a><span class="id">[2512.01082]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>White dwarfs (WDs) are the final fate of about 97\% of the stars in our galaxy, making them vital tracers of stellar history. A fraction of WDs exist in cataclysmic variable (CV) systems, accreting matter from a nearby companion star. A subset of CVs undergo episodic rapid mass transfer, termed dwarf novae (DNe) outbursts. Some accreting WDs exhibit near sinusoidal photometric variations, interpreted as $g$ mode pulsations. However, identifying pulsation modes in accreting WDs remains challenging due to the paucity of available observed modes. In this work, we present a comprehensive computation of the observable $g$ mode frequencies across a range of WD parameters, varying the WD mass, size of the newly accreted layer and core temperature. We also introduce a novel method for mode identification based on the time evolution of pulsation periods following an accretion episode. Our mode identification method does not rely on the direct detection of the consecutive radial mode orders, frequently required in isolated WDs. Moreover, this work improves upon our previous WD modeling efforts. We use a more realistic core temperature in addition to thermohaline mixing and element diffusion enabled during the accretion phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Test of Substellar Evolutionary Models with High-Precision Ages from Asteroseismology and Gyrochronology for the Benchmark System HR 7672AB</a><span class="id">[2512.06083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-precision measurements for HR 7672AB, composed of a Sun-like (G0V) star and an L dwarf companion.

We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\pm0.47$ Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\pm0.40$ Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR 7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR 7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\pm0.017$ $\text{M}_\odot$ for HR 7672A and $75.39\pm0.67$ $\text{M}_{\text{Jup}}$ for HR 7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\% uncertainty) makes HR 7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $&lt;$0.3$\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1–3$\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR 7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. We also detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR 7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varying core-envelope coupling efficiency identified from stellar rotation–activity relation</a><span class="id">[2512.11376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-envelope coupling provides a reasonable explanation of the spin-down stalling of stars in open clusters, which was not predicted by classical gyrochronology. However, it remains an open question whether the coupling efficiency is constant or variable. M dwarfs, possessing thicker convective envelopes and thus longer coupling timescales than other late-type stars, are ideal objects for this investigation. In this work, based on the $R_{\rm{HK}}^{'}$ measurements from LAMOST and DESI spectra, we construct new rotation–activity relations for M dwarfs. Unlike the traditional picture, we suggest that the new relation consists of three distinct regimes of fast, intermediate, and slow rotation, closely matching the three sequences of gyrochronology, namely the “Convective” sequence, “Gap”, and “Interface” sequence. Our study reveals, for the first time, a variable activity decay rate in the intermediate-rotation regime (i.e., the “Gap” region). This implies a varying core-envelope coupling efficiency, peaking towards the end of this region. It also coincides with the well-known stage of stalled stellar spin-down.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simultaneous JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA Monitoring of Sgr A*: A Unified Picture of the Variable IR, X-ray and Radio Emission</a><span class="id">[2512.20786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Flux variability is a fundamental channel of information from Sgr A* because of its direct probe of processes occurring within an accretion disk under strong gravity. We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal capture and repeating partial tidal disruption events of giant stars</a><span class="id">[2601.13113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass – lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift CAMIRA clusters of galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.16386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from XMM-Newton observations of ten high-redshift ($0.81 &lt; z &lt; 1.17$) galaxy clusters selected from the CAMIRA catalog based on high richness ($N &gt; 40$). These massive clusters, identified in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program field, provide an ideal sample for probing the dynamical state of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the early Universe. We performed uniform X-ray imaging and spectral analyses to measure the ICM temperature and bolometric luminosity, and investigated cluster morphology through offsets between the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray peak. Extended X-ray emission was detected from all targets, but only one system was classified as dynamically relaxed, indicating a low relaxed fraction ($\sim 10\%$) at high redshift. By combining this high-$z$ sample with a lower-redshift CAMIRA cluster sample, we derived scaling relations among richness, temperature, luminosity, and mass. The results are broadly consistent with predictions from both the self-similar model and the baseline model incorporating the mass–concentration relation. We find no significant redshift evolution, strengthening the view that cluster scaling relations are largely established by $z \sim 1$. We also examined the AGN fraction among member galaxies and found significantly higher AGN activity in high-redshift clusters, particularly in the outskirts, suggesting enhanced AGN triggering during early cluster assembly and a possible connection to the thermodynamic state of dynamically young clusters. These findings provide new insights into the formation and evolution of massive clusters and the thermodynamic history of the ICM, and complement large-area X-ray surveys such as eROSITA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational imprints of tidal internal gravity wave dissipation in star-planet systems</a><span class="id">[2602.03723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 13% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07137" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessment of DKIST/VTF Capabilities for the Detection of Local Acoustic Source Wavefronts</a><span class="id">[2602.07137]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that temporal filtering can successfully identify local-acoustic-source wavefronts in radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar photosphere. Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) instrument on the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cold and eccentric: a high-spectral resolution view of 51 Eri b with VLT/HiRISE</a><span class="id">[2602.10260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Discovered almost 10 years ago, the giant planet 51 Eridani b is one of the least separated (0.2 arcsec) and faintest (J = 19.74 mag) directly imaged exoplanets known to date. Its atmospheric properties have been thoroughly investigated through low- and medium-resolution spectroscopic observations, enabling robust characterization of the planet's bulk parameters. However, the planet's intrinsically high contrast renders high-resolution spectroscopic observations difficult, despite their potential to yield key measurements essential for a more comprehensive characterization. This study seeks to constrain the planet's radial velocity, enabling a full 3D orbital solution when integrated with previous measurements. We have obtained 4 high-contrast high-resolution (R = 140000) spectroscopic datasets of the planet, collected over a two-year interval with the HiRISE visitor instrument at the VLT to derive the planet's radial velocity. Using self-consistent models of atmosphere, we were able to derive the radial velocity of the planet at each of the 4 epochs. These radial velocity measurements were then used in combination with all existing relative astrometry in order to constrain the orbit of the planet. Our radial velocity measurements allow us to break the degeneracy along the line of sight, making it now possible the unambiguous interpretation of the phase curve of the companion. We further constrain the orbital parameters, particularly the eccentricity, for which we derive e = 0.55 (-0.07, +0.03). The relatively high eccentricity indicates that the system has experienced dynamical interactions induced by an external perturber. We place constraints on the mass and semi-major axis of a hypothetical, unseen outer planet capable of producing the observed high eccentricities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT 2024wpp: the most luminous fast-evolving optical transient linked to the merger explosion of a black-hole binary</a><span class="id">[2602.20523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represent one of the most exotic astrophysical transients, exhibiting unusually strong emission across X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths.

The nucleation temperature is often used in phase transition analyses, and is defined through the nucleation condition: on average one bubble has nucleated per Hubble volume. We argue that the nucleation temperature is neither a fundamental nor essential quantity in phase transition analysis. We illustrate scenarios where a transition can complete without satisfying the nucleation condition, and conversely where the nucleation condition is satisfied but the transition does not complete. We also find that simple nucleation heuristics, which are defined to approximate the nucleation temperature, break down for strong supercooling. Thus, studies that rely on the nucleation temperature $\unicode{x2014}$ approximated or otherwise $\unicode{x2014}$ may misclassify the completion of a transition. Further, we find that the nucleation temperature decouples from the progress of the transition for strong supercooling. We advocate use of the percolation temperature as a reference temperature for gravitational wave production, because the percolation temperature is directly connected to transition progress and the collision of bubbles. Finally, we provide model-independent bounds on the bubble wall velocity that allow one to predict whether a transition completes based only on knowledge of the bounce action curve. We apply our methods to find empirical bounds on the bubble wall velocity for which the physical volume of the false vacuum decreases during the transition. We verify the accuracy of our predictions using benchmarks from a high temperature expansion of the Standard Model and from the real scalar singlet model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroid-mass soliton as the dark matter-baryon coincidence solution</a><span class="id">[2504.08304]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nontopological solitons formed during first-order phase transitions can serve as macroscopic dark matter candidates, with their stability ensured by a charge asymmetry traditionally assumed to originate from baryogenesis.

We derive a novel and robust conclusion: asteroid-mass coincident soliton dark matter is always accompanied by detectable gravitational waves observable by LISA, $\mu$Ares, and Theia, providing a new candidate beyond primordial black holes in this mass window.

We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the Stückelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials.

For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">When inverse seesaw meets inverse electroweak phase transition: a novel path to leptogenesis</a><span class="id">[2510.09000]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a new nonthermal leptogenesis mechanism triggered by the cosmic first-order phase transition.
