While multi-wavelength studies have detected an increasing number of AGN within dwarf galaxies in the local Universe, $\gamma$-ray emission has so far only been associated with systems hosting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Dwarf-galaxy AGN are of particular interest because their central black holes fall in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) regime, offering insight into the early evolution of SMBHs. Using 15 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT data, we present the first search for $\gamma$-ray emission from dwarf-galaxy AGN. In the sample of 74 X-ray-selected dwarf-galaxy AGN, we find no sources that exceed the \textit{Fermi}-LAT detection threshold. However, a joint-likelihood analysis reveals a modest, trials-corrected population-level excess ($\sim2\sigma$) above blank-field expectations at very soft photon indices $\Gamma \gtrsim 3.8$ above 500 MeV. This hint is most pronounced when source contributions are weighed by $M^\alpha_{{\rm IMBH},i}/d_i^2$, with $\alpha\simeq1$–$1.5$, suggesting – but not confirming – that $\gamma$-ray emission could scale with the central black hole mass or a property correlated with it (e.g., accretion rate), but with a markedly softer spectrum than in SMBH-hosted AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Echoes from the Dark: Galaxy Catalog Incompleteness in Standard Siren Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2509.18243]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave observations can be combined with galaxy catalogs to constrain cosmology and test modified gravity theories using the standard siren method. However, galaxy catalogs are intrinsically incomplete due to observational limitations, potentially leaving host galaxies undetected and thereby weakening constraints or potentially introducing systematic errors. In this work, we present a self-consistent framework to study catalog incompleteness and host weighting effects, implemented in the publicly available CHIMERA pipeline. We obtain joint cosmological and astrophysical population constraints from 100 binary black hole (BBH) events in a LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O5-like configuration, using spectroscopic galaxy catalogs with varying completeness levels and stellar-mass host weighting schemes. We find percent-level constraints on $H_0$ with complete catalogs, reaching precision of 1.6%, 1.3%, and 0.9% for constant, linear, and quadratic mass weighting, respectively. As completeness decreases, the precision degrades following a sigmoid trend, with a threshold and steepness that increase for stronger weightings. Simultaneously, the correlation between $H_0$ and the BBH population mass scale also increases, making results more sensitive to assumptions about the astrophysical population. Remarkably, 2% precision remains achievable when catalogs contain only 50% of the potential host galaxies within the gravitational wave detection horizon, while 1% precision requires host probabilities scaling with stellar mass squared. The results are robust against host weighting mismodeling, even at moderate completeness levels. This work further highlights the importance of spectroscopic galaxy surveys in standard siren cosmology and provides a pathway for developing the science case of future facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CECILIA: Gas-Phase Physical Conditions and Multi-Element Chemistry at Cosmic Noon</a><span class="id">[2509.18257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies at Cosmic Noon (z$\sim$2-3) are characterized by rapid star formation that will lead to significant metal enrichment in the interstellar medium (ISM). While much observational evidence suggests that these galaxies are chemically distinct from those in the local Universe, directly measuring the ISM chemistry in large samples of high-z galaxies is only now possible with the observational capabilities of JWST. In this first key paper of the CECILIA program, we present the direct-method physical conditions and multi-element abundances in twenty galaxies at Cosmic Noon. Using a combination of archival Keck/MOSFIRE and new $\sim$30-hr NIRSpec spectroscopy, we measure multiple electron gas densities and the temperature structure from the O$^+$ and S$^{2+}$ ions. We find that n$_e$[O II] and n$_e$[S II] are comparable but elevated with respect to n$_e$ in local star-forming galaxies, and the simultaneous T$_e$[O II] and T$_e$[S III] generally agree with photoionization model T$_e$ scaling relations. The O abundances in the CECILIA galaxies range from 12+log(O/H)$=$7.76-8.78 (12-123% solar O/H), representing some of the highest direct-method metallicities and lowest T$_e$ measured with JWST to date. The CECILIA galaxies exhibit significantly sub-solar S/O and Ar/O, in agreement with emerging results from other high-z studies and a signature of predominant enrichment from core collapse supernovae. The N/O-O/H trends in the CECILIA galaxies generally agree with the abundance trends in local nebulae, but the large scatter in N/O could be sensitive to the star-formation history. The CECILIA observations underscore the need for exceptionally deep spectroscopy to unveil the ISM abundance patterns in high-z galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distribution of Metals and Multi-Temperature Gas in the Cores of Nearby Galaxy Groups</a><span class="id">[2509.18258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Previous studies of galaxy clusters have focused extensively on the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on the chemical evolution of the intra-cluster medium (ICM). However, similar studies on the atmospheres of lower mass systems, such as galaxy groups and giant ellipticals, remain limited. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the chemical and multi-temperature structure of the intra-group medium (IGrM), using a subsample of nearby galaxy groups and ellipticals from the CHEERS catalogue. By comparing areas with and without AGN feedback related features, such as cavities or extended radio lobes, we find clear evidence of an excess of multi-phase gas along the path of recent AGN feedback. However, its distribution exceeds the length of the radio lobes, since we recover a non-negligible amount of multi-phase gas at larger radii. In contrast to the clear asymmetry in the thermal structure, we find no directional enhancement in the distribution of Fe, with little to no differences in the Fe abundances of the on- and off-lobe directions. Our analysis suggests that the metals in the IGrM of our targets are well-mixed and decoupled from the effects of recent AGN feedback, as indicated by radio-lobes and cavities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18260" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the impact of AGN feedback model variations on the Lyman-$α$ Forest Flux Power Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2509.18260]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the effects of varying different Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback parameters on the Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest 1D transmitted flux power spectrum (P1D). We use the Cosmological and Astrophysics with Machine Learning Simulations (CAMELS) suite to explore variations on the Simba simulation AGN feedback model. The parameters explored include AGN momentum flux, AGN jet speed, supermassive black hole (SMBH) radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass needed to produce jet feedback. Although all parameters affect the P1D, this work explores the radiative efficiency, jet velocity threshold, and minimum SMBH mass in this context for the first time and finds the following results: Primarily, the most massive SMBHs impact the Ly$\alpha$ forest through the jet feedback mode. While heating AGN jets to the virial temperature at injection aids in the removal of neutral hydrogen from the Ly$\alpha$ forest, this heating also inhibits further jet feedback. Similar behaviors are seen when varying the SMBH radiative efficiency, with higher values resulting in a suppression of SMBH growth and thus a later reduction in AGN feedback and lower values directly reducing the impact of AGN feedback on the Ly$\alpha$ forest P1D. These results imply that increasing the AGN feedback strength in the Simba simulation model suppresses the Ly$\alpha$ forest P1D, but only if the feedback does not impact the number of massive jet producing BHs. Future studies of AGN feedback models will require careful exploration of the unique aspects of the specific subgrid model, and how they interact with one another, for a complete understanding of the potential astrophysical impacts of SMBH feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A novel algorithm for GPU-accelerated particle-mesh interactions implemented in the QUOKKA code</a><span class="id">[2509.18261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel, GPU-optimized algorithm for particle-mesh interactions in grid-based hydrodynamics simulations, designed for massively parallel architectures. This approach overcomes the inefficiency of particle neighbour searches or sorts across multiple GPU nodes by using a new “particle-mesh-particle” interaction scheme, which extends the particle-mesh method for self-gravity. The algorithm proceeds in two main stages: first, quantities exchanged between particles and the mesh – such as mass, energy, and momentum added by stellar feedback or removed by accretion onto a sink – are deposited into a buffer mesh equipped with ghost zones, where multiple contributions per cell are accumulated using atomic additions and then communicated across distributed memory ranks. In the second stage, the buffer states are applied to real mesh states, incorporating cell-wise limiters to enforce physical constraints such as positive density. We implement this scheme in the GPU-native radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code QUOKKA, demonstrating its application to both supernova feedback and sink particle accretion. We demonstrate that the former scheme converges in the terminal radial momentum from multiple supernovae across varying spatial resolutions, while for the latter simulations of accretion in several configurations show excellent agreement with analytic solutions. This scheme enables efficient, scalable particle-mesh coupling for GPU-optimized simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18264" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Identification of Anomalous E+A Galaxies in GAMA Using and Isolation Forest</a><span class="id">[2509.18264]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We implement an outlier detection model, an Isolation Foest (iForest), to uncover anomalous objects in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly Fourth Data Release (GAMA DR4). The iForest algorithm is an unsupervise Machine Learning (ML) technique. The data used is the spectroscopic and photometric data from GAMA DR4, which compiless information for over 300000 objects. We select two samples of galaxies to isolate, high signal-to-noise galaxies, to analyse the iForest's robustness, and E+A galaxies, to study the extremes of their population. This results in six-subsamples of spectroscopic, photometric and combined data isolations, finding 101 anomalous objects, half of which have not been identified as outliers in other works. We also find a number of fringing errors and false emission lines, displaying the iForest's potential in detecting these errors. Finding anomalous E+A galaxies, that although selected in a normal manner, using low [OII] and strong H{\delta} absorption, are still star-forming, with strong H{\alpha} emission. We propose two solutions to why these E+A galaxies are still star-forming but also question if these galaxies can be truly classified as E+A galaxies. We suggest that small-scale interactions on the galaxies causes small star bursts. The radiative pressure when forming high mass stars form expels the accreting material quicker than it can be accreted. We also suggest that the Jeans limit in our anomalous E+A galaxies is so low that it is simply not possible to form O and B class stars, but not low enough to fully prevent star-formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Growth of Dust in Galaxies in the First Billion Years with Applications to Blue Monsters</a><span class="id">[2509.18266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A combination of JWST observations at z 12-14 and ALMA observations of extremely dust-rich systems at z 6 has demonstrated that dust grows extremely fast in the early Universe, with galaxies amassing up to 10^7 Msun of dust in just 500 Myr between z=12-&gt;6. In this paper we demonstrate, via a series of numerical experiments conducted in cosmological zoom-in simulations, that a likely pathway for this dust accumulation in the first formed galaxies is through production at early times via supernovae, followed by the rapid growth on ultrasmall dust grains. Our main results follow. The stellar production of dust dominates until z   10-11 at which point galaxies transition to a growth-dominated regime. We employ a Shapley analysis to demonstrate that the local density is the dominant factor driving dust growth, followed by the grain size distribution. A rapid rise in the small-to-large grain ratio with decreasing redshift (owing to grain-grain shattering) drives growth through increased dust surface area per unit mass. Growth models are necessary to match the dust content of ALMA detected sources at z   6. Finally, we demonstrate that “blue monsters”, massive, UV-bright galaxies at $z&gt;10$ with extremely blue continuum slopes likely have dust-to stellar mass ratios 10^-4-10^-3, but their top-heavy grain size distributions render them optically thin in the UV, providing a natural explanation for their observed properties without requiring exotic dust geometries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep chemical tagging - Identifying open clusters and moving groups in chemical space with graph attention networks</a><span class="id">[2509.18268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reconstructing the formation history of the Milky Way is hindered by stellar migration, which erases kinematic birth signatures. In contrast, stellar chemical abundances remain stable and can be used to trace stars back to their birth environments through chemical tagging. This study aims to improve chemical tagging by developing a method that leverages kinematic and age information to enhance clustering in chemical space, while remaining grounded in chemistry. We implement a graph attention auto-encoder that encodes stars as nodes with chemical features and connects them via edges based on orbital similarity and age. The network learns an “informed” chemical space that accentuates coherent this http URL to $\sim$47,000 APOGEE thin disk stars, the method identifies 282 stellar groups. Among them, five out of six open clusters are successfully recovered. Other groups align with the known moving groups Arch/Hat, Sirius, Hyades, and Hercules. Our approach enables chemically grounded yet kinematically and age informed chemical tagging. It significantly improves the identification of coherent stellar populations, offering a framework for future large-scale stellar archaeology efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small-scale Lyman alpha forest cosmology with PRIYA: Constraints from XQ100 and KODIAQ-SQUAD one-dimensional flux power spectra</a><span class="id">[2509.18271]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new cosmological analysis of the small-scale Lyman alpha forest 1D flux power spectrum (P1D) using high-resolution quasar spectra from XQ100 and KODIAQ-SQUAD, interpreted through the PRIYA emulator. PRIYA is a suite of galaxy formation simulations spanning a range of cosmological and inhomogeneous HeII reionization parameters, enabling few-percent-level predictions of the P1D. These datasets, probing down to $k \sim 6\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z = 2-5$, offer access to non-linear scales inaccessible to large-volume surveys like eBOSS. We find that the XQ100 P1D yields constraints on the primordial power spectrum parameters $(A_P, n_P)$ at pivot scale $k_0 = 0.78\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ that are consistent with PRIYA results from eBOSS DR14 and Planck CMB, albeit with broader uncertainties. Notably, this is achieved without external IGM temperature data, showing that XQ100 alone provides stronger constraints on thermal history than eBOSS DR14. In contrast, the KODIAQ-SQUAD P1D favors a significantly higher $A_P$ value, driven by the selection bias toward high-column density absorbers (HCDs). We also find that the P1D at $k &gt; 0.045\,\mathrm{s/km}$ is more sensitive to Lyman limit system contamination and thermal history. When imposing a prior on $(A_P, n_P)$, the reduced $\chi^2$ remains unchanged and the inferred mean IGM temperature is unaffected, suggesting that cosmological and thermal parameters are largely sensitive to different scales. The XQ100 P1D therefore provides complementary information on thermal nuisance parameters, which can be jointly fit with eBOSS or DESI P1D measurements to improve cosmological constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analysing the prevalence of tidal features in HSC-SSP using self-supervised representation learning</a><span class="id">[2509.18274]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use a combination of self-supervised machine learning and visual classification to identify tidal features in a sample of 34,331 galaxies with stellar masses $\log_{10}(M_{*}/\rm{M}_{\odot})\geq9.5$ and redshift $z\leq0.4$, drawn from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) optical imaging survey. We assemble the largest sample of 1646 galaxies with confirmed tidal features, finding a tidal feature fraction $f=0.06^{+0.05}_{-0.01}$. We analyse how the incidences of tidal features and the various classes of tidal features vary with host galaxy stellar mass, photometric redshift, and colour, as well as halo mass. We find an increasing relationship between tidal feature fraction and host galaxy stellar mass, and a decreasing relationship with redshift. We find more tidal features occurring in group environments with $12.0&lt;\log_{10}(M_{200}/\rm{M}_{\odot})&lt;14.0$ than in the field or in denser, cluster environments. We also find that the central galaxies of the most massive ($\log_{10}(M_{200}/\rm{M}_{\odot})&gt;14.1$) groups and clusters exhibit higher rates of tidal features than the satellite galaxies. We find good agreement between the trends we observe and the results obtained from purely visual or other automated methods, confirming the validity of our methodology and that using machine learning can drastically reduce the workload of visual classifiers, having needed to visually classify less than 30 per cent of our sample. Such methods will be instrumental in classifying the millions of suitable galaxies to be observed by large upcoming imaging surveys such as the Vera C.

We reconstruct their star formation histories and find that they have large bursts ($100\textrm{ M}_{\odot} \textrm{yr}^{-1} -1000 \textrm{ M}_{\odot} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$), followed by a rapid truncation of star formation. The number densities of the quenched galaxies in our sample that we predict underwent a submillimeter phase are consistent with submillimeter galaxies being the progenitors of our quenched population. The median post-starburst visibility time is $\sim600$ Myr, with more massive galaxies ($\log \textrm{M}_*/\textrm{M}_\odot &gt; 10.7$) exhibiting shorter visibility times than lower mass galaxies. The range of quenching times – defined as the time from the peak starburst to the time of quiescence – found in this sample ($0.06-1.75$ Gyr) suggests multiple quenching pathways, consistent with previous studies. We do not see evidence for quenching mechanisms varying with redshift between $1&lt;z&lt;3$. We detect evidence for weak AGN activity in 4 out of the 8 galaxies with robust emission line detections, based on line ratio diagnostics. Our findings suggest that there are a diverse range of quenching mechanisms at cosmic noon, and support a scenario in which the primary quenching mechanisms are rapid ($&lt;500$ Myr) following a starburst.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyman-alpha emission at the end of reionization: line strengths and profiles from MMT and JWST observations at z 5-6</a><span class="id">[2509.18302]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With JWST, it is now possible to use Lyman-Alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission from galaxies beyond z&gt;8 to trace neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) as the Universe became reionized. However, observed Ly$\alpha$ emission is scattered by neutral hydrogen in the IGM and the interstellar and circum-galactic medium, necessitating `baseline' models of Ly$\alpha$ properties in the ionized IGM to disentangle their impacts. In this work, we characterize Ly$\alpha$ properties at the end of reionization, z 5-6, providing a baseline that can be applied to z&gt;6 observations. We targeted GOODS-N with MMT/Binospec, obtaining R 4360 rest-frame UV spectra of 236 galaxies at z 5-6, selected from HST/CANDELS, finding 62 Ly$\alpha$ detections. We use JWST observations from JADES and FRESCO for a subset of our sources to characterize Ly$\alpha$ properties as a function of UV continuum and H$\alpha$ emission. We present the first statistical measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ FWHM distribution at z 5-6, and produce empirical baseline models of Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EWLy$\alpha$) and escape fraction (f$_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$) conditional on UV magnitude and slope. We find our EWLy$\alpha$ and f$_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$ models depend on UV magnitude, and infer 45$\pm$5$\%$ and &lt;62$\pm$8$\%$ of MUV=-19.5 galaxies have EWLy$\alpha$&gt;25$Å$ and f$_{esc}^{Ly\alpha}$&gt;0.2, respectively. We find a mean Ly$\alpha$ FWHM of 245km/s and median Ly$\alpha$ velocity offset of 258km/s, both correlating with higher UV luminosity. Our median observed Ly$\alpha$ line profile is broader and has higher velocity offset compared to pre-JWST models based on z 2 lines, which may reflect resonant scattering by residual neutral hydrogen in the IGM at z 5-6 and increasing ISM/CGM densities. Our median line profile predicts higher Ly$\alpha$ transmission in a fully neutral IGM, providing insight into recent z&gt;10 Ly$\alpha$ detections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piecing together formic acid isomerism in dark clouds. Detection of cis-formic acid in TMC-1 and astrochemical modeling</a><span class="id">[2509.18315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of molecular isomers in interstellar environments has become a topic of growing interest within the astrochemical community. Contrary to predictions based on thermodynamic equilibrium, recent observations reveal a diverse array of high-energy isomers and conformers. One of the most iconic molecular isomers detected in space, formic acid (HCOOH, FA), has been the focus of extensive theoretical research aimed at understanding its speciation into cis and trans conformers in dark clouds and photodissociation regions. In this work, we report the detection of c-FA, the higher-energy conformer, using ultrasensitive observations of TMC-1. This detection adds to previous findings in the Barnard-5 and L483 dark clouds. The derived trans-to-cis isomer ratio in TMC-1, 17.5, closely matches those observed in other sources, suggesting that the same chemical processes are at play across these environments. To investigate this, we conducted detailed astrochemical gas-grain models tailored to formic acid isomerism to explain the observed ratios. Our models successfully reproduce the observed trans/cis ratios and indicate that the presence of cis-formic acid can be attributed to the release of c-FA from grains, followed by isomerization driven by the excess energy released during the desorption process, a process that we name as isomerization upon desorption. The models also show that the isomerization of t-FA to c-FA in the gas phase is negligible at 10 K, meaning the observed ratios are a direct consequence of the formation pathways of both isomers on the surface of dust grains. However, at higher temperatures, quantum tunneling mediated direct isomerization in the gas becomes significant, and the ratios converge toward the thermodynamic equilibrium value.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18322" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Timescales of Embedded Star Formation as Observed in STARFORGE</a><span class="id">[2509.18322]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star formation occurs within dusty molecular clouds that are then disrupted by stellar feedback. However, the timing and physical mechanisms that govern the transition from deeply embedded to exposed stars remain uncertain. Using the STARFORGE simulations, we analyze the evolution of “embeddedness”, identifying what drives emergence. We find the transition from embedded to exposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its maximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which accrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually balances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their maximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars are revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud, driving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their fast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate the dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that emergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the cloud's free-fall time. We also examine the evolution of dust emission and H$\alpha$ luminosity. We find that dust dominates the luminosity for roughly 2 Myrs before stellar luminosity becomes more luminous. These results suggest that deeply embedded star-forming clusters tend to be rare compared to those partially exposed. Thus, because the initial embedding of the most luminous stars is highly local, the emergence of stars is a faster, earlier, more local event than the overall disruption of the cloud by gas expulsion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematics of synthetically observed high-$z$ rotating disks: reliability and biases of 3D fitting tools</a><span class="id">[2509.18328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Resolved high-redshift galaxy gas kinematics is a rapidly evolving field driven by increasingly powerful instrumentation.

We present the recovered 3D-fitted kinematical parameters to assess their reliability, quantify the range of values possible for individual source studies, and establish the systematic biases present for observed samples. The $V/\sigma_{\rm V}$ ratio, which indicates how dynamically cold a system is, is of particular importance and depends on the choice of 3D-fitting tool. On average, 3DBarolo and Qubefit slightly overestimates $V/\sigma_{\rm V}$ ($&lt;1\sigma$) and GalPaK3D underestimates it ($&lt;2\sigma$). Therefore, all three tools are reliable for kinematical studies of averages of high-redshift galaxy samples. The value range possible for individual sources is significant, however, even more so for samples of not purely rotation dominated sources. To determine whether an observed galaxy is rotation dominated enough to be fitted with a 3D-kinematical tool, $V/\sigma_{\rm V}$ can be extracted directly from the observed data cube, with some caveats. We recommend that the median offsets, value ranges, and tool-dependent biases presented in this paper are taken into account when interpreting 3D-fitted kinematics of observed high-redshift galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Comprehensive Analysis of Three Microlensing Planet Candidates with the Planet/Binary Degeneracy</a><span class="id">[2509.18345]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present observations and analyses of three high-magnification microlensing events: KMT-2022-BLG-0954, KMT-2024-BLG-0697, and MOA-2024-BLG-018. All three exhibit the &quot;Planet/Binary&quot; degeneracy, with planetary solutions corresponding to mass ratios in the range $-3.7 &lt; \log q &lt; -2.2$, while the binary solutions yield $\log q &gt; -2.0$. For KMT-2022-BLG-0954, we identify a previously unrecognized degeneracy among planetary solutions, involving different mass ratios and normalized source radii. In all three cases, single-lens binary-source models are excluded. Bayesian analyses suggest that the planetary solutions correspond to gas giants orbiting M/K dwarfs beyond the snow line, while KMT-2022-BLG-0954 also admits an alternative interpretation as a super-Earth orbiting a late-type M dwarf. The binary solutions imply a diverse set of systems, including M-dwarf pairs and M-dwarf–brown-dwarf binaries. A review of known events subject to the &quot;Planet/Binary&quot; degeneracy shows that in most cases the degeneracy cannot be resolved through follow-up high-resolution imaging, particularly in the presence of the newly identified degeneracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Metallicity Dependence of PAH Emission in Galaxies II: Insights from JWST/NIRCam Imaging of the Smallest Dust Grains in M101</a><span class="id">[2509.18347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity using JWST/NIRCam imaging of the nearby galaxy M101, covering regions from solar metallicity (Z$_{\odot}$) down to 0.4 Z$_{\odot}$. These maps are used to trace the radial evolution of the shortest-wavelength PAH feature at 3.3 $\mu$m, which is emitted preferentially by the smallest PAHs ($&lt;100$ carbon atoms). The fractional contribution of PAH 3.3 $\mu$m to the total PAH luminosity ($\Sigma$PAH) increases by 3x as metallicity declines, rising from $\sim$1$\%$ to $\sim$3$\%$ over the observed range, consistent with prior predictions from the inhibited grain growth model based on Spitzer spectroscopy. We explore model refinements including photon effects and alternative size evolution prescriptions, and find that a modest amount of small grain photo-destruction remains possible, provided the grain size cutoff does not exceed $\sim55$ carbon atoms. The best-fit models predict 3.3 $\mu$m/$\Sigma$PAH will rise to $\sim5.6-7.7\%$ at 10$\%$ Z$_{\odot}$. Surprisingly, even as $\Sigma$PAH drops significantly relative to the total infrared luminosity (TIR) as metallicity declines, 3.3 $\mu$m/TIR alone rises, potentially indicating the mass fraction of the smallest PAH grains increases as the total dust content in galaxies drops. The current model cannot fully reproduce this trend even if the unusually strong effects of changing radiation field hardness on 3.3 $\mu$m/TIR are included. This may be evidence that the smallest PAHs are uniquely robust against destruction and inhibited growth effects. These results highlight the pivotal role that short-wavelength PAH emission can play in studies of low-metallicity and high-redshift galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Emission in MHD Galaxy Formation Simulations with Full Cosmic Ray Spectra</a><span class="id">[2509.18351]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way's galactic center is a highly dynamical, crowded environment. Gamma ray observations of this region, such as the excess of GeV scale gamma rays observed by Fermi LAT, have been of tremendous interest to both the high energy astrophysics and particle physics communities. However, nearly all past studies of gamma ray emission make simplifying assumptions about cosmic ray (CR) propagation that may not be valid in the galactic center. Recent numerical breakthroughs now enable fully time dependent dynamical evolution of CRs in magnetohydrodynamic simulations with resolved, multi phase small scale structure in the interstellar medium (ISM), allowing self consistent comparisons to the Milky Way cosmic ray spectrum. We model diffuse gamma ray emission from cosmic ray interactions for a set of Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE) simulations of Milky Way mass galaxies run with spectrally resolved cosmic ray spectra for multiple species at MeV to TeV energies. We find that the galactic center gamma ray spectrum can vary by order of magnitude amounts in normalization, and by approx. 10 percent in spectral slope at high energies, driven by both injection from highly variable star formation and losses from variable structure in the turbulent ISM. Gamma ray emission from inverse Compton scattering and relativistic nonthermal Bremsstrahlung is particularly variable on Myr timescales. We argue that features of the observed Milky Way gamma ray spectrum may arise from such transient phenomena in gamma rays produced from CR interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VLA Observations at 6 and 19 GHz of a Complete Sample of Radio Loud Quasars with redshifts between 2.5 and 5.28: II.

They form blue straggler stars, give rise to spectacular transients, and produce some of the most massive stars in the Universe. Here, we focus on mergers from binary evolution and stellar collisions but do not cover mergers involving compact objects. We review how mergers come about, explain the physics and outcome of the merger process, discuss the evolution and ultimate fates of merged stars, and relate to observations. Our main conclusions are: (i) Mergers of main-sequence stars often fully rejuvenate and have interior structures similar to genuine single stars. (ii) Contrarily, mergers involving post-main-sequence stars can have interior structures that cannot be achieved by single-star evolution. Such merged stars may become long-lived blue supergiants that can explode in SN1987A-like events, interacting and superluminous supernovae, ultra-long gamma-ray bursts or collapse into very massive black holes. These black holes may even populate the pair-instability-supernova black-hole mass gap. (iii) Strong magnetic fields are produced in stellar mergers. Merged stars may thus be at the origin of some magnetic OBA stars and their descendants, highly magnetic white dwarfs and neutron stars. (iv) Initially, stellar merger products rotate rapidly, but there are several mechanisms that can quickly spin them down. Hence, merged stars may be rather slow rotators for most of their evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Southern massive stars at high angular resolution.

A key property of massive stars is their high degree of multiplicity, which can impact their evolution and end-of-life products. The Southern Massive Stars at High Angular Resolution survey (smash+) use interferometric and high-angular resolution techniques to detect companions at intermediate separations, from about 1 milli-arsec to 8&quot;), a domain that so far has remained largely unexplored. Aims. In this paper, we convert the angular separations and magnitude contrasts into physical units, i.e. projected physical separations and mass ratios. We also derive the sensitivity of the survey for various physical and orbital parameters. Methods. We develop a spectral-type/luminosity class – H-band luminosity – mass calibration based on existing grids of physical parameters of OBA stars and we use these to obtain the photometric distance to each system, correcting for all known companions within the 2MASS point-spread function. We also derive the individual masses of the primaries and of each detected companion. Results The probability of detecting companions is very uniform within the sensitivity limits of the \smash\ survey. The projected separations follow a flat power-law distribution in log-separation. The obtained mass ratios are compatible with the power-law distributions derived for spectroscopic binaries. Finally, we find a uniform mass-ratio distribution up to  100 AU. Beyond  100 AU, we observe a lack of equal-mass companions, with an upper mass-ratio limit declining towards larger separations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidally-Controlled Fragmentation around Black Holes, Massive Clumps, Protostars, and the Galactic Center</a><span class="id">[2509.18495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravity plays important roles at multiple scales in the universe. An important, yet often neglected, role of gravity is its ability in driving anisotropic fragmentation through tides. When tides dominate, fragmentation becomes anisotropic, and the Jeans length along the short axis, $l_{\rm tidal, Jeans}$, is approximately $\sigma_{\rm v}/\sqrt{G \rho_{\rm mean}}$, determined by the external tides through the mean density $\rho_{\rm mean}$. We compare predictions of $l_{\rm tidal, Jeans}$ against observational results in massive star-forming clumps, the Circumnuclear Disk (CND) around the supermassive black hole Sgr A* at the center of the Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone in the Galactic Center, a hub-filament system, and a streamer around a young star. We find that the observed widths of these filamentary structures match theoretical predictions from tidally-controlled Jeans fragmentation. The formation of filaments can potentially shield cold gas against radiation pressure and photoevaporation, as well as hydrodynamical interaction with the ambient medium, potentially enabling the cold gas to survive. Thus, tidal forces are major players regulating gas transport around massive objects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18496" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematics of the interstellar medium using Gaia: A catalogue of 102 YSO-MC associations within 3.5 kpc from the Sun with 3D velocities</a><span class="id">[2509.18496]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kinematic information is crucial for understanding the evolution of complex systems, such as interstellar gas. Obtaining full 3D kinematic information is a crucial final step for modeling and interpretation. Molecular clouds are nurseries where stars are born. Stars at a very early stage, like young stellar objects (YSOs), inherit the spatial and kinematic structure of the gas patches they originate from. In this paper, we combine measurements of radial velocities towards the gas and the kinematic information of YSOs from Gaia DR3 to derive 3D velocities of a sample of YSO (Young Stellar Object)-MC (Molecular Cloud) complexes at d$\lesssim$3.5kpc from the Sun. We find that the molecular interstellar medium traced by the YSO-MC complexes generally follows Galactic rotation, with an additional peculiar velocity of 8.6 km s$^{-1}$. The random motion of these complexes in the Galactic XY plane is more energetic than motion along the Z direction. A catalogue containing the 3D velocities of the YSO-MC complexes at different reference frames is available, and the distances and 3D velocities of well-known molecular clouds are presented. Our results set the foundation for exploring the interplay between the Galaxy, the molecular ISM, and star formation.

However, the effects of these SN explosions on the formation and evolution of the Local Bubble, as well as on nearby star formation, remain not fully understood. To study the expansion history of the Local Bubble, we use the kinematic data of the young stars obtained by cross-matching the pre-main-sequence (PMS) star catalog of \citet{Zari2018} with the high-precision astrometric and photometric data from the {\it Gaia} DR3 database. We perform a three-dimensional spatial clustering analysis on these young stars to identify star associations. We discover three unique star associations that exhibit a wiggle-like velocity pattern. The distances of these star associations are 108.5308, 141.5284, and 176.0318 pc, respectively. Their radial velocities in the Local Standard of Rest (LSR) are 10.0622, 5.4982, and 9.0581 km/s, showing a pattern of decreasing and then increasing. This velocity pattern, as predicted by \citet{Krause&amp;Diehl2014}, is caused by a recent re-acceleration affected by the SN explosion, reinforcing the picture of the Local Bubble as an evolving entity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of Stellar Activity and Habitable zone: I.

Based on GALEX NUV observations, we study the evolution of stellar NUV emission for a sample of 386,500 A- to M-type dwarfs spanning ages from 3 Myr to 10 Gyr, drawn from both open clusters and the field. The normalized NUV emission ($f_{\rm NUV}/f_{\rm J}$) is used to trace the evolutionary trends. Our results reveal distinct evolutionary pathways after considering the distance completeness: A and early-F dwarfs show a weak decline in NUV emission during the main-sequence phase; late-F to G dwarfs exhibit a clear decrease, consistent with continuous spin-down driven by magnetic braking; late-K and M-dwarfs undergo a rapid decline in NUV emission when they evolve from young stellar objects to main-sequence stars. Furthermore, we construct the evolutionary tracks of stellar ultraviolet habitable zone (UHZ). By comparing stellar circumstellar habitable zone (CHZ) and UHZ, we find that G- and K-type stars offer the most stable overlap between thermal and UV habitability over long-term evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Origins of Neutron-capture Elements In Globular Cluster M22</a><span class="id">[2509.18650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The chemical abundances of metal-poor stars in globular clusters provide important constraints on their evolutionary scenarios.

We found the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) mostly distributed in a regularly rotating disc with a hole $\sim5$ kpc wide around the galactic centre. The continuum observations reveal, within the HI hole, emission from one of the lowest luminosity AGN known to date and from two unique $\sim10$-kpc wide bipolar bubbles never observed before in this galaxy. The properties of the bubbles suggest that they may result from the impact of the low-power radio jet propagating within the gaseous disk instead of perpendicular to it. We found indication for jet-induced ionised outflows within the HI hole but no molecular gas (upper limit of $M_{\text{H$_2$}}&lt;2\times10^5\text{ M$_\odot$}$) is detected. The emerging picture is that the gas in the central regions has been rapidly depleted by the stellar bar or, despite its low power, the AGN in NGC 1371 is efficiently heating and/or removing the gas through the jets and possibly by radiative winds, leading to the inside-out quenching of the galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSS-IV MaNGA: Data-Model Discrepancy in Temperature-sensitive Line Ratios for Star-forming Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.18770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gas-phase metallicity is a fundamental parameter that helps constrain the star-forming history and chemical evolution of a galaxy. Measuring electron temperature through auroral-to-strong line ratios is a direct approach to deriving metallicity. However, there is a longstanding discrepancy between metallicity measured through the direct method and that based on the photoionization models. This paper aims to verify and understand the discrepancies. We bin   1.5 million spaxels from SDSS-IV MaNGA according to metallicity and ionization parameters derived from theoretical strong-line calibrations. We stack the spectra of spaxels within each bin and measure the flux of strong lines and faint auroral lines. Auroral lines for [OII], [SII], [OIII], and [SIII] are detected in the stacked spectra of most bins, and the [NII] auroral line is detected in fewer bins. We apply an empirical method to correct dust attenuation, which makes more realistic corrections for low ionization lines. We derive electron temperatures for these five ionic species and measure the oxygen and sulfur abundances using the direct method. We present the resulting abundance measurements and compare them with those model-calibrated strong-line abundances. The chemical abundances measured with the direct method are lower than those derived from the photoionization model, with a median of 0.09 dex. This discrepancy is smaller compared to the results based on other metallicity calibrations previously reported. However, we notice that the direct method could not account for the variation in ionization parameters, indicating that the precise calibration of metallicity using the direct method has yet to be fully realized. We report significant discrepancies between data and the photoionization model, which illustrates that the one-dimensional photoionization model is incapable of representing the complexity of real situations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEDust: A Pipeline for Deriving Best-Fit Spectral Energy Distributions from DUSTY Outputs</a><span class="id">[2509.18795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we introduce SEDust, a pipeline designed to identify the best-fitting spectral energy distributions from the outputs of the DUSTY code and compare them to observational data.

To enhance astrophysical realism, the study incorporates a multi-component galactic potential, modeling the influence of the surrounding stellar distribution, dark matter, and hot gas with the central blackhole. Our analysis reveals that the inclusion of the galactic potential induces subtle yet noteworthy shifts in the locations of sonic points. This effect is particularly pronounced in the vertical equilibrium disc model, where the region allowing for shock formation undergoes significant modification. The nature of critical points is determined by analyzing the eigenvalues of the corresponding stability matrix, establishing that multi-transonicity is restricted to a finite range of angular momentum. Shock strength and associated dynamic &amp; thermodynamic quantities-such as mach number, pressure, density and temperature-are found to vary sensitively with galactic parameters, and are illustrated through comprehensive parametric plots. Additionally, a time-dependent linear perturbation analysis, demonstrates that the governing perturbation equations retain their structural form even in the presence of a galactic potential. The flows remain stable under adiabatic, radially propagating perturbations. Interestingly, the perturbative framework naturally gives rise to an emergent acoustic metric, identifying the system as a classical analogue of gravity. The corresponding acoustic surface gravity is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a dependence on both the spin of the black hole and the characteristics of the surrounding galactic environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Treasure Hunt in the Pool of Spectra Classified as High-redshift QSOs by the Spectroscopic Pipeline of the SDSS DR16</a><span class="id">[2509.18889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of outsiders in the form of unusual, rare, or even unknown object types is important as they can provide useful information about otherwise hidden physical phenomena and processes.

However, it is unclear whether this relation primarily traces metal retention or the integrated production of metals, as past studies have obtained contrasting results. We investigate this issue through an extensive Random Forest and Partial Correlations analysis of spectral cubes of 4,500 galaxies from the MaNGA survey. We find that stellar mass ($\rm M_*$) and baryonic gravitational potential ($\rm \Phi_* = M_*/R_e$) are the two most important quantities determining gas metallicity in galaxies. However, their relative roles strongly depend on the galactocentric radius – the metallicity within 1 $\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the stellar mass, while the metallicity at radii beyond 1.5 $\rm R_e$ depends primarily on the gravitational potential. This finding can be interpreted in terms of metals in the central region ($\rm R\leq 1~R_e$) being mostly bound, regardless of the global gravitational potential and, therefore, the metallicity is determined primarily by the cumulative production of metals (hence the integrated star formation history, i.e. $\rm M_*$); by contrast, in the galactic peripheries the retention of metals depends more critically on the gravitational potential, hence the stronger dependence of the metallicity on $\rm \Phi_*$ at large radii. Our finding reconciles apparent discrepancies between previous results. Finally, we find that the Star Formation Rate is the third most important parameter (after $\rm M_*$ and $\rm \Phi_*$) in determining the metallicity, as expected from the Fundamental Metallicity Relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of thiocarbonic acid (H2CS3) - the sulfur counterpart of carbonic acid (H2CO3) - in interstellar analog ices</a><span class="id">[2509.19065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The first experimental formation of thiocarbonic acid (H2CS3) is presented in this work from low-temperature interstellar ice analogs composed of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon disulfide (CS2) exposed to electron irradiation simulating the impact of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) on interstellar ices.

The sample is biased towards low-surface brightness and large dwarfs, i.e., UDG-like galaxies, and includes two galaxies with a double nucleus, 13 newly identified nucleated dwarfs thanks to HST's high spatial resolution, and five candidate ultra-compact dwarf progenitors. We modeled the NSCs with a Sérsic profile and derived their structural properties and photometry. We find the NSC Sérsic index to increase with the luminosity and stellar mass, while no obvious trend is seen on the effective radius and ellipticity. The faint NSCs tend to have a constant color profile, whereas the bright ones have a bluer center, suggesting that the most massive NSCs in our sample might have experienced a mixed formation scenario, including in-situ star formation. A significant portion of our NSCs tend to be more massive than for other galaxy samples of similar stellar mass, which could be due to some dwarfs ongoing tidal disruption or an initial formation of massive NSCs from multiple GC mergers and in-situ star forming activity. More observations of resolved NSC are needed to be able to infer their formation scenario from the structural properties and photometry in dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking Young Stellar Object Morphology to Evolutionary Stages with Self-Organizing Maps</a><span class="id">[2509.19069]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studies in the past few decades have investigated young stellar object evolution based on their spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED is heavily influenced not only by evolutionary stage, but also the morphology of the young star. This work is part of the NEMESIS project which is aiming to revisit star formation with the aid of machine learning techniques and provides the framework for this work. In a first effort towards a novel spectro-morphological classification we analyzed young stellar object morphologies and linked them to the currently used observational classes. Thereby we aim to lay the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification, and apply the insights learned in this study in a future, revisited classification scheme. We obtained archival high-resolution survey images from VISTA for approximately 10,000 literature young stellar object candidates towards the Orion star formation complex (OSFC). Utilizing a Self-Organizing map (SOM) algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning method, we created a grid of morphological prototypes from near- and mid-infrared images. Furthermore, we determined which prototypes are most representative of the different observational classes, derived from the infrared spectral index, via Bayesian inference. We present our grids of morphological prototypes of young stellar objects in the near-infrared, which were created purely from observational data. They are thus non-dependent on theoretical models. In addition, we show maps that indicate the probability for a prototype belonging to any of the observational classes. We find that SOMs created from near-infrared images are a useful tool, with limitations, to identify characteristic morphologies of young stellar objects in different evolutionary stages. This first step lays the foundation for a spectro-morphological classification of young stellar objects to be developed in the future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Feedback Effects on the Mass Distribution of Clouds and Cloud Complexes</a><span class="id">[2509.19071]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy evolution is sensitive to how stars inject feedback into their surroundings. In particular, stellar feedback from star clusters strongly affects gas motions and the baryonic cycle, with more massive clusters having stronger effects. Our previous results show that the star cluster mass distribution in dwarf galaxies depends on feedback, as strong pre-SN feedback, particularly ionizing radiation, results in fewer high-mass clusters. We investigate the mass distribution of gas clouds in dwarf galaxies. Since clusters form from collapsing gas clouds, we expect a similar feedback dependence in both distributions, so we hypothesize that pre-SN feedback yields fewer high-mass clouds. To test this, we use an isocontour analysis at cutoff densities of $10,\ 10^{1.5},\ 10^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ to identify clouds in dwarf galaxy simulations run with the RAMSES adaptive mesh refinement code. We calculate mass distributions for models with different combinations of SNe, stellar winds, and ionizing radiation. We find that the mass distribution for clouds with $n&gt;100$ cm$^{-3}$ is independent of feedback, but the distribution for complexes with $n&gt;10$ cm$^{-3}$ is more top-heavy in the presence of radiation. Winds do not affect the distribution at any scale. This contradicts our hypothesis that cloud and cluster mass distributions respond similarly to feedback. Instead, the dense cloud mass function shows no feedback dependence, suggesting its shape is set by gravity. We conclude that the cluster mass function must be shaped by intra-cloud feedback regulating star formation and, in the case of radiation, effects on parent cloud temperature.

In constructing an algorithm of the optimal selection of targets for these observations and in comparing the detection efficiencies for several telescopes, we considered models of the night-sky brightness that satisfy the data of infrared observations carried out in 2011 with the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) telescope and the RoboNet telescopes (FTS, FTN, and LT) used to search for planets with the microlensing method. The considered models of the night-sky brightness can be used for various observations (not only microlensing events). The time intervals, during which microlensing events can be observed, were determined with accounting for the positions of the Sun and the Moon and the other constraints on the telescope pointing. Our algorithm allows us to determine the already known microlensing events that are accessible for observation with a particular telescope and to select targets, for which the probability of detecting an exoplanet is maximal. The events, which would maximize the probability of detecting exoplanets, were selected for observations. The probability of detecting an exoplanet is usually proportional to the mirror diameter of a telescope. Telescopes with a wider field of view, such as the OGLE, are more effective in finding new microlensing events. To observe different microlensing events, it is usually better to use different nearby telescopes. However, all such telescopes are often better to use for observing the same event in those relatively short time intervals that correspond to the peak brightness of the event.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyman-$α$ Escape through Anisotropic Media</a><span class="id">[2509.19184]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The escape of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) radiation encodes valuable information on the neutral interstellar medium and is often used as a proxy for the escape of ionizing photons. Yet, the theory of Ly$\alpha$ transfer through anisotropic gas distributions remains underdeveloped. We present Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations of Ly$\alpha$ propagation through porous, inhomogeneous neutral gas, systematically exploring the effects of channel geometry, outflows, dust, and lognormally distributed column densities. We find that Ly$\alpha$ photons do not preferentially escape through the lowest-column-density pathways, but instead traverse channels of substantial optical depth, leading to suppressed central flux and the absence of strongly beamed escape. Subdividing channels has little impact, indicating that geometry and covering fraction are more important than porosity. Channels containing moderate amounts of neutral hydrogen alter escape in characteristic ways, including the appearance of quadruple-peaked spectra, which can be captured by a simple flux-channel relation. Outflows reshape the spectra by facilitating escape through dense media, redshifting photons and blending central features, while dust modulates the visibility of small channels by suppressing flux at line center; in both cases, we develop an analytical model that predicts the resulting central fluxes. Extending to lognormal column density fields, we show that Ly$\alpha$ photons probe a broad range of optical depths, producing skewed spectra that can be approximated by weighted sums of homogeneous models. Our results have direct implications for using Ly$\alpha$ as a tracer of gas properties and ionizing photon escape; for instance, spectra suggestive of high column densities may nonetheless allow LyC leakage through narrow channels.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recalibration of the H$α$ surface brightness-radius relation for planetary nebulae using Gaia DR3: new distances and the Milky Way oxygen radial gradient</a><span class="id">[2509.19239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spatial distribution of chemical elements in the Galactic disk provides key constraints on models of galaxy evolution. However, studies using planetary nebulae (PNe) as tracers have been historically limited by large uncertainties in their distances. To overcome the long-standing distance uncertainties, we recalibrated the H$\alpha$ surface brightness-radius relation (Frew et al. 2016) with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, deriving statistical distances for 1,200 PNe and Bayesian distances for 419 objects with reliable parallaxes. Adopting Bayesian values preferentially, we determined the O/H radial gradient for 230 disk PNe. We tested three models: a single linear gradient, a segmented fit with one break, and a segmented fit with two breaks. Although model selection is statistically inconclusive, segmented fits indicate a change in slope near the solar radius ($R \sim 8$ kpc), with a flatter or slightly positive gradient inward and a steeper negative gradient outward. This feature may reflect changes in star formation efficiency driven by the Galactic bar or the corotation resonance of the spiral arms. Comparison with other tracers - Cepheids, red giants, and open clusters - shows qualitative consistency. The two-dimensional O/H distribution in the Galactic plane supports the adopted distances and reveals modest azimuthal asymmetry, with enhanced abundances near the bar at positive longitudes, and a bimodal abundance structure between the inner and outer solar regions. Our results provide new constraints on the chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the impact of non-axisymmetric structures, and the possible existence of distinct radial abundance regimes across the Galactic disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2509.19240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy groups in various evolutionary stages</a><span class="id">[2509.19251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The formation process of galaxy groups is not yet fully understood. In particular, that of fossil groups (FGs) is still under debate. Due to the relative rarity of FGs, large samples of such objects are still missing. The present paper aims to analyse the properties of groups in various evolutionary stages (FGs, &quot;almost&quot; FGs, and non-FGs), and to increase the sample of FG candidates. We have spectroscopically observed galaxies in four groups and ten candidate FGs detected in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. We searched for substructures by applying the Serna-Gerbal dendrogram method to analyse the dynamical structure of each group. By applying the FIREFLY software to the continuum and PIPE_VIS to the emission lines, we derived the stellar population properties in various regions for each group. A roughly continuous variation in properties is found between a group that is still building up (XCLASS 1330), a well-formed massive group (MCG+00-27-023), a dynamically complex non-FG (NGC 4065), and a near-FG (NGC 4104). We also optically confirm two FGs in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, but their X-ray luminosity is still unknown. We observe that the lower the mass of the substructure, the more recent the stellar population in the considered groups. We also show an apparent lack of high-mass substructures for low-metallicity systems. These results are consistent with the generally adopted model of energy transfer during interactions of the galaxies with the group and cluster potential wells. Furthermore, the fossil status of a group might be related to the large-scale environment. Therefore, studying the positions of non-FGs, near-FGs, and FGs within the cosmic web can provide insights into the process of how fossil systems come into being in the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18660" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigation of low-energy electron scattering from ethylene glycol</a><span class="id">[2509.18660]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ethylene glycol is a prebiotically relevant complex organic molecule detected in interstellar and cometary environments, yet quantitative low-energy electron-ethylene glycol scattering data remain limited for astrochemical modeling.

We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulent gas-rich discs at high redshift: origin of thick stellar discs through 3D 'baryon sloshing'</a><span class="id">[2502.01895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In response to recent observations from JWST and ALMA, we explore a new class of dynamically self-consistent models using our AGAMA/Ramses hydrodynamic N-body framework (Nexus) that mimics a plausible progenitor of the Milky Way over a wide range of disc gas fractions ($f_{\rm gas} = 0-100\%$). The high gas surface densities encourage vigorous star formation, which in turn couples with the gas to drive turbulence. We show that this coupling through momentum recoil drives 'baryon sloshing,' i.e. a random walk of the baryonic potential minimum with respect to the centre of the total gravitational potential, $\Phi_{\rm tot}$. The amplitude of the bulk motion depends on the strength of the feedback, which in turn is directly associated with $f_{\rm gas}$. At its most extreme, when gas is the sole contributor to the disc potential ($f_{\rm gas}=100$%), the amplitude of the walk can reach up to $R\approx 5$ kpc and $\vert z\vert \approx 1$ kpc within $\Phi_{\rm tot}(R,\phi,z)$. Consistent with observations, the disc dominates over dark matter ($f_{\rm disc}\gtrsim 50$%) within $R_s=2.2 R_{\rm disc}$, where $R_{\rm disc}$ is the exponential disc scale length. For a lower $f_{\rm disc}$ and/or $f_{\rm gas}$, the 3D sloshing amplitude and velocity are reduced. The combination of strong feedback (which unbinds the disc) and sloshing leads to the newly formed stars being dynamically heated and settling to a more spatially extended disc population. The 3D heating process is isotropic but its effects are more noticeable in $\vert z\vert$ due to the initial dynamical coldness of the star-forming disc. Such a disc has enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] stellar abundances and a vertical (but no radial) gradient in stellar age and metallicity, both consistent with the Milky Way's thick stellar disc. Contrary to earlier claims, star formation in a stationary turbulent disc does $not$ produce thick stellar discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The COSMOS-Web Lens Survey (COWLS) III: forecasts versus data</a><span class="id">[2503.08785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compare forecasts for the abundance and properties of strong gravitational lenses in the COSMOS-Web survey, a $0.54$ deg$^2$ survey of the COSMOS field using the NIRCam and MIRI instruments aboard JWST, with the first catalogue of strong lens candidates identified in the observed NIRCam data, COWLS.

The majority of the lenses are forecast to have small Einstein radii ($\theta_{\rm E} &lt; 1$ arcsecond) and lie at redshifts between $0 &lt; z &lt;2$, whilst the source redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim 3$ and has a long tail extending up to $z \sim 11$, unambiguously showing that strong lensing in JWST can probe the entirety of the epoch of reionisation.

Past studies indicated that a stellar bar can excite such a quadrupole feature in the $&lt; V_R &gt;$ distribution. However, a systematic study investigating the co-evolution of bar and quadrupole structure is largely missing. Furthermore, whether this quadrupole structure in $&lt;V_R&gt;$ can be used as a robust kinematic diagnostic to constrain bar properties, particularly for the Milky Way, is still beyond our grasp. Here, we investigate the bar-induced quadrupole feature using a suite of isolated $N$-body models forming prominent bars and a sample of Milky Way-like barred galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. We demonstrate that the properties of the quadrupole (strength, length, and orientation) are strongly correlated with the bar properties, regardless of the choice of the thin/thick disc stars; thereby making the quadrupole feature an excellent kinematic diagnostic for constraining the bar properties. In presence of spirals, the estimator which takes into account the phase-angle of $m = 4$ Fourier moment, serves as a more appropriate estimator for measuring the length of the quadrupole. Further, we constructed a novel Gaia-like mock dataset from a simulated bar model while incorporating the dust extinction and the broad trends of observational errors of the Gaia survey. The quadrupole properties (strength and length) estimated from those Gaia-like mock data are larger ($\sim 35-45$ percent) when compared with their true values. We showed that the majority of this effect is due to the uncertainty in parallax measurement. This demonstrates that the quadrupole structure in Gaia data is likely a result of dominant Gaia parallax errors/biases, almost masking the true inherent signature of the MW bar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15237" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Pre-Infall Magellanic Analog– Corona and Stream formation in the \textsc{HESTIA} cosmological simulations</a><span class="id">[2504.15237]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We identify and investigate a pre-infall analog of the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC) in the HESTIA suite of constrained cosmological simulations.

Using Sérsic profile fits to F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size–mass relation and find typical sizes of $\sim$0.6–0.8 kpc at $M_{\ast} = 5 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$, consistent with $\sim$7$\times$ growth from $z \sim 4$ to the present, including $\sim$2$\times$ by $z \sim 2$. We find tentative evidence that formation history and morphology jointly influence galaxy sizes: late-forming bulge-dominated galaxies appear more compact by $\sim$0.2–0.3 dex relative to the expected relation, while late-forming disk-dominated galaxies are larger. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by $\log(1+\delta^{\prime}_{3})$ from the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$), which spans 0.25–1. In the {\sc IllustrisTNG} simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction ($f_{\ast,\mathrm{ex\text{-}situ}}$) – a proxy for mergers – is instead the dominant predictor of $B/T$. Galaxies with high $B/T$ in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales ($\lesssim0.4$ Gyr), consistent with bulge growth through merger-driven starbursts; in simulations, such systems exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions ($\sim$20–30\%). In contrast, some high-$B/T$ galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional processes – such as violent disk instabilities – also contribute. These results point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project.

In three of the participating codes, a distinct, rotation-dominated inner core emerges with a formation timescale of $\lesssim 300$ Myr, largely driven by a major merger event, while two other codes exhibit similar signs of wet compaction – gaseous shrinkage into a compact starburst phase – at earlier epochs. The remaining three codes show only weak evidence of wet compaction. Consequently, we divide the simulated galaxies into two groups: those with strong compaction signatures and those with weaker ones. Galaxies in these two groups differ in size, stellar age gradients, and disk-to-total mass ratios. Specifically, codes with strong wet compaction build their outer disks in an inside-out fashion, leading to negative age gradients, whereas codes with weaker compaction feature flat or positive age gradients caused primarily by outward stellar migration. Although the stellar half-mass radii of these two groups diverge at $z \sim 3$, the inclusion of dust extinction brings their sizes and shapes in mock observations closer to each other and to observed galaxies. We attribute the observed morphological differences primarily to variations in the stellar feedback implementations – such as delayed cooling timescales, and feedback strengths – that regulate both the onset and duration of compaction. Overall, our results suggest that disk assembly at high redshifts is highly sensitive to the details of the stellar feedback prescriptions in simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reproducing galactic rotation curves with a two-component bosonic dark matter model</a><span class="id">[2505.07465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bosonic stars,hypothetical astrophysical entities, are generally categorized into two primary classes based on the nature of their constituent particles: Einstein Klein Gordon stars, made up of massive scalar bosons, and Proca stars, their vector ”cousins”. Depending on the boson masses and field frequencies, these objects may exhibit properties of diffuse, massive structures, with sizes comparable to or even exceeding those of galaxies. This concept has inspired the bosonic dark matter halo hypothesis, providing a theoretical framework to effectively model the dark matter content of galactic halos. In this paper we build on our previous work to explore the possibility of using vector and scalar bosons to model the components of galactic dark matter halos and subhalos in order to reproduce the observed rotation curves of galaxies. By employing diverse combinations of those bosonic dark matter models in conjunction with observable data for a sample of galaxies, we show that our two component dark matter approach notably improves the agreement between observations and theoretical predictions with respect to our previous investigation. Our framework may shed new light on the enduring mystery surrounding the apparent matter deficit observed in dwarf and spiral galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Escape fractions from unattenuated Ly$α$ emitters around luminous $z&gt;6$ quasars</a><span class="id">[2507.05381]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Ionized proximity zones around luminous quasars provide a unique laboratory to characterize the Ly$\alpha$ emission lines from $z&gt;6$ galaxies without significant attenuation from the intergalactic medium (IGM). However, Ly$\alpha$ line measurements for galaxies within high-redshift quasars' proximity zones have been rare so far. Here we present deep spectroscopic observations obtained with the NIRSpec/MSA instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) of galaxies in two $z&gt;6$ quasar fields. We measure the Ly$\alpha$ line fluxes for 50 galaxies at $6&lt;z&lt;7$ with UV absolute magnitude $M_\text{UV}&lt;-19$ (median $M_\text{UV}=-19.97$), among which 15 are located near the luminous quasars, i.e. within $\Delta v&lt;2500\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. We find that galaxies near the quasars show significant flux bluewards of the systemic Ly$\alpha$ wavelength, and have higher Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width compared to galaxies at similar redshifts that are not located within the quasars' environment. Our result indicates little or no redshift evolution for the Ly$\alpha$-emitter fraction from $z\sim6.4$ to $z\sim5$. Leveraging the low IGM opacity in the quasars' vicinity, we evaluate the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}$) of high-redshift galaxies. Our analysis suggests that galaxies at $\langle z\rangle\approx6.4$ have an average $f_\text{esc}^{\text{Ly}\alpha}=0.14\pm0.04$. This value is consistent with reionization models where the Lyman continuum escape fraction is low $(f_\text{esc}^\text{LyC}\lesssim0.1)$ for luminous galaxies, and where the most luminous galaxies have only a minor contribution to the total ionizing photon budget.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intercepting 3I/ATLAS at Closest Approach to Jupiter with the Juno spacecraft</a><span class="id">[2507.21402]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is expected to arrive at a distance of $53.56(\pm 0.45)$ million ${\rm km}$ ($0.358\pm 0.003$ au) from Jupiter on March 16, 2026.

We further show that it is possible for Juno to come much closer to 3I/ATLAS ($\sim{27}$ million km) with 110 kg of remaining propellant, merely 5.4% of the initial fuel reservoir. We find that for low available $\Delta$V there is no particular benefit in application of a double impulse (for example to reach $\sim{27}$ million km from 3I/ATLAS), however if Juno has a higher $\Delta$V capability there is significant advantage to a second impulse with typically a saving of propellant by a factor of a half.

We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: A machine-learning search for dual and lensed AGN at sub-arcsec separations</a><span class="id">[2508.19494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological models of hierarchical structure formation predict the existence of a widespread population of dual accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on kpc-scale separations, corresponding to projected distances &lt; 0&quot;.8 at redshifts higher than 0.5. However, close companions to known active galactic nuclei (AGN) or quasars (QSOs) can also be multiple images of the object itself, strongly lensed by a foreground galaxy, as well as foreground stars in a chance superposition. Thanks to its large sky coverage, sensitivity, and high spatial resolution, Euclid offers a unique opportunity to obtain a large, homogeneous sample of dual/lensed AGN candidates with sub-arcsec projected separations. Here we present a machine learning approach, in particular a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify close companions to known QSOs down to separations of $\sim\,$0&quot;.15 comparable to the Euclid VIS point spread function (PSF). We studied the effectiveness of the CNN in identifying dual AGN and demonstrated that it outperforms traditional techniques. Applying our CNN to a sample of $\sim\,$6000 QSOs from the Q1 Euclid data release, we find a fraction of about 0.25% dual AGN candidates with separation $\sim\,$0&quot;.4 (corresponding to $\sim$3 kpc at z=1). Estimating the foreground contamination from stellar objects, we find that most of the pair candidates with separation higher than 0&quot;.5 are likely contaminants, while below this limit, contamination is expected to be less than 20%. For objects at higher separation (&gt;0&quot;.5, i.e. 4 kpc at z=1), we performed PSF subtraction and used colour-colour diagrams to constrain their nature.

Here, we show that radiation pressure from Ly$\alpha$ photons produced in the pre-SN phase can instead erase feedback-free conditions, and severely limit the star formation efficiency (SFE). We find that, for a constant star formation rate, all clouds with gas surface density $(37-1.7 \times 10^5)\ M_\odot\ \rm pc^{-2}$ have $\epsilon_* &lt; 0.08$. Higher SFE values can only be reached if Ly$\alpha$-driven shells fragment and form stars. While advanced RHD simulations are required to establish the importance of this effect, adopting an optimistic guess, we find that the SFE increases with cloud surface density, rising from $\epsilon_*=0.023$ at $\Sigma_g = 37\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{pc^{-2}}$ to $\epsilon_*=0.27$ at $\Sigma_g = 1.7 \times 10^5\ M_\odot\ \mathrm{pc^{-2}}$. Given the optimistic assumptions adopted, these numbers should be regarded as upper limits. We conclude that Ly$\alpha$ radiation pressure strongly limits the SFE, even at solar metallicities, erasing the possibility that a feedback-free star formation mode with $\epsilon_* \gtrsim 0.4$ exists in the pre-SN phase. This conclusion remains valid even when other effects such as dust destruction of Ly$\alpha$ photons, presence of HII regions, velocity gradients, atomic recoil, and turbulence are considered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lensed quasars in CatNorth I. Wide-separation candidates</a><span class="id">[2509.17071]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Wide-separation lensed quasars (WSLQs) are a rare subclass of strongly lensed quasars produced by massive galaxy clusters. They provide valuable probes of dark-matter halos and quasar host galaxies. However, only about ten WSLQ systems are currently known, which limits further studies. To enlarge the sample from wide-area surveys, we developed a catalog-based pipeline and applied it to the CatNorth database, a catalog of quasar candidates constructed from Gaia DR3. CatNorth contains 1,545,514 quasar candidates with about 90% purity and a Gaia G-band limiting magnitude of roughly 21. The pipeline has three stages. First, we identify groups with separations between 10 and 72 arcsec using a HEALPix grid with 25.6 arcsec spacing and a friends-of-friends search. We then filter by intra-group color and spectral similarity, reducing the 1,545,514 sources to 14,244 groups while retaining all known, discoverable WSLQs. Finally, a visual check, guided by image geometry and the presence of likely foreground lenses, yields the candidate list with quality labels. We identify 333 new WSLQ candidates with separations from 10 to 56.8 arcsec. Using available SDSS DR16 and DESI DR1 spectroscopy, we uncover two new candidate systems; the remaining 331 candidates lack sufficient spectra and are labeled as 45 grade A, 98 grade B, and 188 grade C. We also compile 29 confirmed dual quasars as a by-product. When feasible, we plan follow-up spectroscopy and deeper imaging to confirm WSLQs among these candidates and enable the related science.</p></div></details></article>

Observationally, photospheric equivalent-width variations were measured in 1000 selected spectra from three years of HARPS-N data of the Sun-as-a-star, showing changes that largely shadow the chromospheric CaII H&amp;K activity-cycle signal, but with much smaller amplitudes on sub-percent levels. Among iron lines, the greatest are for FeII in the blue, while the trends change sign among lines in the green MgI triplet and between Balmer lines. No variation was seen in the semi-forbidden MgI 457.1 nm. Theoretically, hydrodynamic 3D modeling of solar surface convection produced time sequences of synthetic high-resolution spectral atlases. Radial velocities averaged over small simulation areas jitter by some +-150 m/s, scaling to 2 m/s for the full solar disk on timescales of granular convection. Among different lines, jittering is in phase, but amplitudes differ by about one tenth of their values: greater for stronger and for ionized lines, decreasing at longer wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating Image Coaddition with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.

In the previous papers in this series, we have re-implemented the {\sc Imcom} algorithm, which offers control over point spread functions in coadded images, and applied it to state-of-the-art image simulations for Roman. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of {\sc Imcom} hyperparameters on the quality of measurement results. We re-coadd the same $16$ blocks ($1.75 \times 1.75 \,{\rm arcmin}^2$, $2688 \times 2688$ pixels each) from OpenUniverse2024 simulations with $26$ different configurations in each of $5$ bands. We then compare the results in terms of $12$ objective evaluation criteria, including internal diagnostics of {\sc Imcom}, properties of coadded noise frames, measurements of injected point sources, and time consumption. We demonstrate that: i) the Cholesky kernel is the best known linear algebra strategy for {\sc Imcom}, ii) in general, a wide Gaussian target output PSF outperforms a smoothed Airy disk or a narrow Gaussian, iii) kernel-specific settings are worth considering for future coaddition, and iv) {\sc Imcom} experimental features studied in this work are either inconsequential or detrimental. We end this paper by discussing current and next steps of {\sc Imcom}-related studies in the context of Roman shear and clustering measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18306" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crank-rocker optical fiber mode scrambler prototype for the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF)</a><span class="id">[2509.18306]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When coherent light propagates through a multimode optical fiber, the modes interfere at the fiber exit boundary, producing a high-contrast speckle interference pattern called modal noise. This non-uniform interference pattern introduces systematic errors in fiber-fed precision radial velocity (RV) spectrographs which are detrimental to exoplanet mass measurement. Modal noise can be mitigated by a device called a fiber mode scrambler or fiber agitator, which dynamically perturbs the fiber to change the interference pattern over time, smoothing it over long exposures. In this paper, we present a prototype optical fiber mode scrambler based on a four-bar linkage crank-rocker mechanism, developed for the GMT-Consortium Large Earth Finder (G-CLEF). G-CLEF is a fiber-fed, high-resolution, precision RV spectrograph for the Magellan Clay Telescope and Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT). To support this effort, we developed a fiber testing setup capable of imaging the near-field and far-field output of fibers and measuring focal ratio degradation. We designed, built, and tested the mode scrambler, using our setup, on step-index multimode optical fibers with various shapes, including octagonal, square, and rectangular core cross-sections. We developed custom software utilizing alpha shapes to identify the boundary of an arbitrarily shaped fiber and to compute a signal-to-noise ratio metric for quantifying modal noise. We investigated the effects of different mode scrambler parameters, such as agitation frequency, on mitigating modal noise. Our results offer valuable insights into optimizing fiber mode scrambling for precision RV spectrographs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18333" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimation of Temporal Muon Signals in Water-Cherenkov Detectors of the Surface Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</a><span class="id">[2509.18333]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory is a 3000 km$^2$ array of stations, whose main components are Water-Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) recording ground-level signals from extensive air showers (EASs) initiated by Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs).

With no analogue in the solar system, these planets open fundamental questions in planetary processes, origins, and habitability, and present new avenues in the search for life elsewhere. Atmospheric observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are enabling unprecedented characterization of sub-Neptunes, starting with the first detections of carbon-bearing molecules in the habitable zone sub-Neptune K2-18 b. We survey the present landscape of JWST observations and atmospheric inferences of sub-Neptunes, which in turn provide key insights into their atmospheric processes, internal structures, surface conditions, formation pathways and potential habitability. The atmospheric abundance constraints reveal evidence of chemical disequilibria, and insights into the planetary mass-metallicity relation in the sub-Neptune regime. Similarly, for sub-Neptunes with H$_2$O-rich interiors, increasing atmospheric H$_2$O abundances with the equilibrium temperature may indicate the existence of a critical temperature for transition from H$_2$ dominated atmospheres with tropospheric cold traps to those with steamy atmospheres. The chemical abundances also provide initial evidence for diverse planet types, from potentially habitable hycean worlds to steam worlds with super critical water layers. These planet types serve as benchmarks for an emerging taxonomy of volatile-rich sub-Neptunes as a function of their equilibrium temperature and atmospheric extent, heralding a new era of chemical classification of low-mass exoplanets with JWST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A search for Be stars in multiple systems within the solar neighborhood</a><span class="id">[2509.19286]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Be stars are widely considered to be the product of binary interaction.

Our findings rule out a multiplicity fraction &gt;27% at the 3${\sigma}$ level within the speckle observations separation range and detection limits. Future homogeneous spectroscopic/interferometric observations are essential to probe the inner separations, and along with analysis of available astrometry can cover the entire separation range to characterize the multiplicity fraction, and evolutionary scenario of Be stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the operating characteristics of an ion-milled phonon-mediated quantum parity detector</a><span class="id">[2509.18637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Phonon sensitive superconducting qubits promise to provide sub-eV energy deposit thresholds, useful for future rare-event experiments looking for interactions from dark matter and neutrinos.

Our results show that this platform can be highly competitive for astrophysical simulations employing this class of algorithms, delivering more than a $2 \times$ speedup and approximately $2 \times$ energy savings compared to a highly optimized CPU implementation of the same code.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MauveSim: the instrument simulator software for the Blue Skies Space Mauve satellite</a><span class="id">[2502.01389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present MauveSim, the instrument simulator software for Mauve, the latest mission from Blue Skies Space dedicated to time-domain stellar astronomy. MauveSim functions as an end-to-end simulator, employing the most up-to-date knowledge of the instrument's performance and characteristics that will be reviewed and updated after commissioning. The software accepts a stellar spectrum - either observed or synthetic - as input and produces a simulated observation. The tool thus enables the assessment of various scientific objectives, as well as determining limiting magnitudes and conducting signal-to-noise (S/N) analyses. The results of MauveSim have been validated against instrument performance data from extensive ground testing campaigns, ensuring that the software reflects the most up-to-date understanding of the payload performance. Accessible to all scientists involved in the mission, MauveSim serves as a crucial tool for target selection and observation planning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLARA: A Modular Framework for Unsupervised Transit Detection Using TESS Light Curves</a><span class="id">[2508.04722]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present CLARA, a modular framework for unsupervised transit detection in TESS light curves, leveraging Unsupervised Random Forests (URFs) trained on synthetic datasets and guided by morphological similarity analysis. This work addresses two core questions: (a) How does the design of synthetic training sets affect the performance and generalization of URFs across independent TESS sectors? (b) Do URF anomaly scores correlate with genuine astrophysical phenomena, enabling effective identification and clustering of transit-like signals? We investigate these questions through a two-part study focused on (1) detection performance optimization, and (2) the physical interpretability of anomalies. In Part I, we introduce three URF model variants tuned via alpha-controlled scoring objectives, and evaluate their generalization across five TESS sectors. This large-scale test involved scoring 384,000 individual light curves (128,000 light curves per alpha variant), revealing stable, interpretable differences between recall-optimized, precision-optimized, and balanced models. In Part II, our optimized clustering (DPMM Cluster 2) yields a 14.04% detection rate (16 confirmed transits among 114 candidates) from the first five TESS SPOC sectors. This reflects a substantial enrichment over baseline rates: 0.4569% for the full TESS-SPOC project candidate set (7658 candidates across 1.68 million light curves), and 0.2650% for the FFI-based SPOC sample (7658 candidates across 2.89 million light curves;). Additionally, we perform Monte Carlo injection-recovery tests to assess feasibility, stability, justification and quantification of methods outlined. CLARA processed over 87,000 TESS SPOC light curves (Sectors 1-5).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Transients Handler for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</a><span class="id">[2508.20726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is a next-generation gamma-ray observatory in both the Southern (Paranal, Chile) and Northern Hemisphere (La Palma, Spain) and will consist of up to 100 imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes. With sensitivity far exceeding current facilities, CTAO will provide detailed measurements of gamma rays from GeV up to a few 100s of TeV. CTAO has a nominal field of view of 10° and will rely on external alerts from observatories such as IceCube (neutrinos), Fermi-LAT (GeV gamma rays), LIGO (gravitational waves (GWs)) or the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory (optical) to trigger observations of targets of opportunity (ToOs). The Transients Handler (TH) is a subsystem of the Array Control and Data Acquisition that will provide the means of handling alerts and schedule follow-up observations. The TH is responsible for (i) filtering of thousands of internal and external alerts per night, (ii) processing of alerts according to the corresponding observation proposal to determine the optimal observation schedule with minimum interruptions to observations and (iii) broadcasting of events detected by CTAO to external facilities. In this work, we will discuss the architecture of the Transients Handler, its latest improvements and future updates</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proof-of-Principle Experiment on a Displacement-Noise-Free Neutron Interferometer for Gravitational Wave Detection</a><span class="id">[2505.17146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The displacement-noise-free interferometer (DFI) is designed to eliminate all displacement-induced noise while retaining sensitivity to gravitational wave (GW) signals. Ground-based DFIs suffer from physical arm-length limitations, resulting in poor sensitivity at frequencies below 1 kHz. To address this, previous research introduced a neutron-based DFI, which replaces laser light with neutrons and achieves exceptional sensitivity down to a few hertz. In this study, we conducted a proof-of-principle experiment using a pulsed neutron source at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J- PARC). Despite practical constraints that led to deviations from the ideal experimental design, we optimized the setup and developed a novel analysis method that successfully cancels displacement noise while preserving simulated GW signals. This work presents the first successful demonstration of a neutron DFI and a neutron interferometer for GW detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity of a Gigahertz Fabry-Pérot Resonator for Axion Dark Matter Detection</a><span class="id">[2506.03091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions are hypothetical pseudo-Nambu Goldstone bosons that could explain the observed cold dark matter density and solve the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Haloscope experiments commonly employ resonant cavities to search for a conversion of axion dark matter into photons in external magnetic fields. As the expected signal power degrades with increasing frequency, this approach becomes challenging at frequencies beyond tens of Gigahertz. Here, we propose a novel haloscope design based on an open Fabry-Pérot resonator. Operating a small-scale resonator at cryogenic temperatures and at modest magnetic fields should already lead to an unparalleled sensitivity for photon-axion couplings $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ at 35GHz. We demonstrate how this sensitivity could be further improved using graded-phase mirrors and sketch possibilities to probe benchmark models of the QCD axion.</p></div></details></article></body>
