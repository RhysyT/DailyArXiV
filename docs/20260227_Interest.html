<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Absolute Hierarchy of Quantum Complementarity</a><span class="id">[2602.22792]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bohr's principle of complementarity, prohibiting simultaneous access to certain physical properties within a single experimental arrangement, is considered to be a defining feature of quantum mechanics. It is commonly viewed as inducing an intrinsic hierarchy among incompatible observables: some sets of quantum properties are fundamentally more incompatible than others, as quantified by the maximal sharpness permitting their joint measurement. We show that this hierarchy ceases to be absolute in the multi-copy regime. Analyzing qubit spin observables, we prove a No-Comparison Theorem establishing that no global ordering of incompatible observable sets is preserved across all finite-copy configurations. In particular, two sets of observables can exhibit reversed complementarity ordering depending solely on whether the available resources are arranged as identical copies or as parallel-antiparallel pairs. Thus, the degree of quantum incompatibility is not an intrinsic property of observables alone but depends on the global configuration of the prepared quantum probes. Our results uncover a configuration-dependent structure of complementarity, reveal a subtle role of entanglement in shaping the structure of measurement limitations, and call for a reassessment of quantum information protocols under finite resources.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The challenging task of investigating student thinking: an example from quantum computing</a><span class="id">[2602.22388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Physics education research (PER) studies how students learn physics, yet the nuances of student reasoning can be notoriously difficult to probe even for PER practitioners. This article presents the story of Item 15 on the Quantum Computing Conceptual Survey (QCCS). This assessment item underwent more revision and discussion within the team than the remaining 19 assessment questions combined. This paper provides a behind-the-scenes look at the development of this assessment question: a story that reveals not only interesting findings about student reasoning in quantum computing (specifically, the phenomenon of phase kickback) but provides a cautionary tale for any instructor or researcher attempting to evaluate student reasoning in physics through a multiple-choice test item.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black holes and bits: A simple path to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy</a><span class="id">[2602.22245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the early 1970s, Jacob Bekenstein discovered that black holes have entropy, which became one of the greatest scientific revolutions of the second half of the 20th century. The objective of this paper is to present a simple derivation – partly heuristic and partly geometric – of the equation for the entropy of a black hole, which we now know as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We will also briefly explore the physical implications of this equation and its relationship to the work of Stephen Hawking.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22252" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Lifespan of Intelligent Technological Civilization in the Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.22252]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we explore constraints on the emergence and longevity of technologically intelligent civilizations in our Galaxy, considering the Fermi paradox. We argue that under optimistic assumptions about the probability of life and intelligence emerging on Earth-like planets, the absence of contact with extraterrestrial civilizations imposes limits on their lifespan. Our analysis suggests that if intelligent life is common, technological civilizations must be relatively short-lived, with lifetimes constrained to $\lesssim 5\times10^3$ years under our most optimistic scenario. Considering electromagnetic communication, we note that our current light cone encompasses the entire Galactic history over the past $\sim 10^5$ years, making the lack of detected signals particularly puzzling for long-lived civilizations. We emphasize that these results should be interpreted as upper bounds derived from the Fermi paradox, not as predictions of actual lifespans.</p></div></details></article></body>
