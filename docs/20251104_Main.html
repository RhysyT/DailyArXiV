Although many of the discrepancies reported in large spectroscopic surveys and confirmed by high-precision techniques such as astrometric microlensing and wide-binary analyses may be attributable to thermal effects, model uncertainties or measurement errors prevent a complete description of some of the observations. Here, we explore an alternative explanation based on the presence of a gravitationally coupled bosonic scalar field that contributes to the stellar mass while remaining electromagnetically invisible. We construct stationary, static mixed configurations consisting of a white dwarf that presents a bosonic scalar field (dark matter) component, forming a composite white dwarf-boson star system. We explore families of solutions showing that a scalar field fraction $f_{\rm DM} \sim 5-15\%$ to the mass contribution can account for the observed redshift excess. Our models provide a physically motivated explanation for the mass bias, might offer new observational signatures, and allow us to place preliminary constraints on the mass and compactness of the scalar field configuration. Finally, using our theoretical framework in combination with Bayesian model selection we provide plausible bounds for the mass of the constituent (ultralight) bosonic particle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00151" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-evaluating Lyman $α$ wing opacities and the low mass-problem in cool white dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2511.00151]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gaia observations have reignited interest in the optical and ultraviolet (UV) opacity problems of cool white dwarfs ($T_{\rm eff} \leq 6000$ K), which were thought to be resolved nearly two decades ago through the inclusion of Lyman $\alpha$ red wing opacity arising from H-H$_2$ collisions in atmospheric models. Recent studies have revealed that their masses derived from Gaia optical photometry are 0.1$-$0.2 M$_{\odot}$ lower than expected from single-star evolution. Since the Ly $\alpha$ H-H$_2$ wing opacity significantly affects the blue end of their optical spectra, it may contribute to the mass discrepancy. To investigate this hypothesis, we revisited the Ly $\alpha$ opacity calculations in the quasi-static single and multi-perturber approximations by explicitly using the ab initio potential energy data of H$_3$ while fully accounting for the H-H$_2$ collision angle. We find that the opacity is slightly smaller than the standard models at the shortest wavelengths ($\leq5000$ angstrom), but larger at longer wavelengths. Comparing synthetic magnitudes (GALEX, Gaia, WISE) to the observations of the 40 pc white dwarf sample, we note that the revised models tentatively reproduce the observed $NUV-G$ colours for stars cooler than 6000 K, but still fail to match $G_{\rm BP} - G_{\rm RP}$ colours, resulting in similarly low inferred masses ($\leq 0.5$ M$_{\odot}$) as obtained with the standard Ly $\alpha$ opacity. Exploring other dominant opacity sources, we discover that decreasing the strength of the bound-free H$^-$ opacity in existing models better reproduces the optical and infrared colours, while collision-induced absorption (CIA) opacity is ineffective in resolving the low-mass problem. We highlight the need for improved opacities and multi-wavelength observations in future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Coupled Tidal Evolution of the Moons and Spins of Warm Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2511.00161]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: The Solar System giant planets harbour a wide variety of moons. Moons around exoplanets are plausibly similarly abundant, even though most of them are likely too small to be easily detectable with modern instruments. Moons are known to affect the long-term dynamics of the spin of their host planets; however, their influence on warm exoplanets (i.e.\ with moderately short periods of about $10$ to $200$ days), which undergo significant star-planet tidal dissipation, is still unclear. Aims: Here, we study the coupled dynamical evolution of exomoons and the spin dynamics of their host planets, focusing on warm exoplanets. Methods: Analytical criteria give the relevant dynamical regimes at play as a function of the system's parameters. Possible evolution tracks mostly depend on the hierarchy of timescales between the star-planet and the moon-planet tidal dissipations. We illustrate the variety of possible trajectories using self-consistent numerical simulations. Results: We find two principal results: i) Due to star-planet tidal dissipation, a substantial fraction of warm exoplanets naturally evolve through a phase of instability for the moon's orbit (the `Laplace plane' instability). Many warm exoplanets may have lost their moon(s) through this process. ii) Surviving moons slowly migrate inwards due to the moon-planet tidal dissipation until they are disrupted below the Roche limit. During their last migration stage, moons – even small ones – eject planets from their tidal spin equilibrium. Conclusions: The loss of moons through the Laplace plane instability may contribute to disfavour the detection of moons around close-in exoplanets. Moreover, moons (even those that have been lost) play a critical role in the final obliquities of warm exoplanets. Hence, the existence of exomoons poses a serious challenge in predicting the present-day obliquities of observed exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Complete Analysis of Subgiant Stellar Systems III: Hip70868</a><span class="id">[2511.00212]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study utilizes &quot;Al-Wardat's method for analysing binary and multiple stellar systems&quot; to estimate a set of parameters for the triple system Hip70868. The method compares the system's observational magnitudes, color indices, and spectral energy distribution (SED) and synthetic SEDs generated through atmospheric modeling of each component. Feedback-adjusted parameters and an iterative approach were employed to achieve the best fit between observational (including the latest measurements of Gaia, release DR3) and synthetic spectral energy distributions. The findings were completed using the distance of 71.89 pc given by Hipparcos 2007's new reduction. The individual components' parameters for the system were derived afterward. The parameters obtained for the individual components are as follows: Component A has an effective temperature (Teff) of 6000 +- 50 K, a surface gravity (log ga) of 4.50 +- 0.05, and a radius (Ra) of 1.43 +- 0.07 R_sun. Component B has a (Teff) of 5910 +- 50 K, a (log gb) of 4.40 +- 0.05, and a radius (Rb) of 1.35 +- 0.07 R_sun. The spectral types of the components were found to be F9 IV and G1 IV, respectively. The findings from this analysis were utilized to accurately position the two system components on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and the evolutionary tracks. The analysis shows that the components have transitioned from the main sequence to the sub-giant stage of their evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watching a Comet Turn On: High Spectral Resolving Power Observations of Comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS)</a><span class="id">[2511.00239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report high spectral resolving power optical observations of comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) as it approached the Sun. This comet was discovered when it was 16 {\sc au} from the Sun. At discovery, the comet had a large and relatively bright coma. However, the spectrum at discovery showed only signatures of dust. We used the coud{é} spectrograph on the McDonald Observatory 2.7 m telescope to obtain spectra, starting when the comet was at a heliocentric distance of 5.06 {\sc au} and following it until 2.47 {\sc au}, to determine what spectral features would appear at each heliocentric distance. The first heliocentric distance for which we detected any emission from the gas was 3.39 {\sc au}, when we first detected CN. As the comet continued inward towards the Sun, various other species were detected. We discuss the implications of the early turn-on of CN and of species first appearing at different heliocentric distances in the context of control of the activity by water.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00250" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deep Chandra X-ray Observations of Abell 2029: the Merger History of a Relaxed, Strong Cool Core Cluster</a><span class="id">[2511.00250]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from very deep (485 ks) Chandra X-ray observations of the relaxed, cool core cluster Abell 2029 (z = 0.0767). A2029 hosts one of the longest, most continuous sloshing spirals ever observed, which we find extends nearly 600 kpc from the cluster core. In addition to providing detailed views of the sloshing spiral, imaging and spectroscopic analysis reveals ICM substructure related to the merger history including a broad “splash” of cooler gas and a potential merger shock. The radio lobes of the central WAT source show evidence of alignment with the sloshing motions, consistent with ICM bulk flow, rather than host-galaxy motion, being the primary driver of lobe bending. Comparison to a 1:10 mass-ratio off-axis merger simulation indicates that the observed ICM structures are relics of a second core passage of a subcluster  4 Gyr after the start of the merger, where the “splash” feature is revealed to be a wake of cool gas trailing behind the subcluster. Overall, our results suggest that A2029 is still settling from past interactions – showing that even the initially most relaxed-looking clusters can be hiding a rich history of dynamical activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino and Cascade Gamma-Ray Emission from Magnetized Turbulent Coronae in Seyfert Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.00388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent neutrino observations from the IceCube Collaboration suggest that Seyfert galaxies are promising candidate sources of neutrinos. Within the standard disk-corona model, we assume that protons are accelerated by a non-resonant acceleration mechanism driven by magnetized turbulence in the corona. These accelerated protons interact with ambient radiation or matter, producing high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays. In this scenario, gamma rays are largely absorbed within the corona. The neutrino luminosity depends primarily on the properties of the corona (such as the X-ray luminosity and radius) and the spectral energy distribution of the target photons. This study demonstrates the relation between the neutrino luminosity and the X-ray luminosity, and further discusses the contribution of cascade gamma rays to coronal radiation. Notably, MeV gamma rays can effectively escape the source, together with neutrinos, and serve as key observational probes for testing this model. Future MeV gamma-ray telescopes, such as AMEGO-X and e-ASTROGAM, are expected to detect such gamma-ray signatures, providing a critical multi-messenger test of the hadronic corona model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Time Observed M-Shaped Coronal Mass Ejection Associated with a Blowout Jet and an Extreme Ultraviolet Wave</a><span class="id">[2511.00459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The coronal blowout jet, extreme ultraviolet (EUV) wave and coronal mass ejection (CME) are common phenomena in the solar atmosphere. In this paper, we report the occurrence of an M-shaped CME event associated with a blowout jet and an EUV wave using high-resolution, multi-angle and multi-wavelength observations taken from Solar Dynamics Observatory, and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory. Interestingly, and for the first time, it is found that two bubble-like CMEs and a jet-like CME were simultaneously triggered by the same eruptive event. Our observational analyses and findings indicate the following: (1) the eruption of a blowout jet led to a large-scale EUV wave; (2) the eruption of the EUV wave swept a small filament (prominence) and a long filament; (3) eventually the EUV wave split-up into two parts, leading to the two bubble-like CMEs, while the blowout jet induced a jet-like CME. The combined events appear to form an M-shape like structure CME, that we sketch throughout a proposed cartoon tentatively explaining the observed complex configuration. Based on observational diagnosis, we argue that the jet, the EUV wave and the multi-CME are highly interlinked. A suggested eruption-model, from the solar atmosphere to the space, is outlined and discussed, providing a possibly new way to probe the relationship between the solar eruptions and the surrounding space. The investigation of such rare phenomenon can be a key point for better understanding of the physical associated triggering mechanisms and energy transport in the solar atmosphere, crucial for MHD simulations and modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Gravitational Collapse of Small Dust Grains in Self-gravitating Disk Structures</a><span class="id">[2511.00513]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet formation may begin much earlier than previously expected, when the protoplanetary disk is still massive and gravitationally unstable. It has been proposed that solid grains can concentrate in the spiral arms of self-gravitating disks, leading to the formation of planetary embryos or cores that can greatly accelerate the process of planet formation. We perform hydrodynamic simulations of self-gravitating gas and even smaller dust grains than previously investigated in 3-dimensional shearing box simulations to explore the conditions necessary to form these planetary seeds. Focusing on small grains of dimensionless stopping time $\mathrm{St}=0.01$ and shorter, we find that disk metallicities $Z \gtrsim 0.02$ can overcome the disruptive effects of dust diffusion among these small dust grains. In the outer reaches of a gravitationally unstable disk, these models correspond to grains of approximately 1$\,mm$ and lead to planetary embryos between 0.1 and 1 Earth mass. The formation of these planetary embryos could therefore reduce the time needed for planet assembly, particularly in the outer regions of the disk where coagulation timescales are longer and solid growth is limited.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photoevaporation Can Reproduce Extended $\mathrm{H_2}$ Emission from Protoplanetary Disks Imaged by JWST MIRI</a><span class="id">[2511.00515]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding dispersal of protoplanetary disks remains a central challenge in planet formation theory. Disk winds, driven by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and/or photoevaporation, are now recognized as primary agents of dispersal. With the advent of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), spatially resolved imaging of these winds, particularly in H2 pure rotational lines, has become possible, revealing X-shaped morphologies and integrated fluxes of $\sim 10^{-16}$-$10^{-15}{\rm \,erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. However, the lack of theoretical models suitable for direct comparison has limited interpretation of these features. To address this, we present the first model of photoevaporative \ce{H2} winds tailored for direct comparison with JWST observations. Using radiation hydrodynamics simulations coupled with chemistry, we derive steady-state wind structures and post-process them to compute H2 level populations and line radiative transfer, including collisional excitation and spontaneous decay. Our synthetic images reproduce the observed X-shaped morphology with radial extents of $\gtrsim 50$-$300{\rm \,au}$ and semi-opening angles of $\sim 37^\circ$-$50^\circ$, matching observations of Tau 042021 and SY Cha. While the predicted line fluxes are somewhat lower than the observed values. These results suggest that photoevaporation is a viable mechanism for reproducing key features of observed H2 winds, including morphology and fluxes, though conclusive identification of the wind origin requires source-specific modeling. This challenges the reliance on geometrical structures alone to distinguish between MHD winds and photoevaporation. Based on our findings, we also discuss alternative diagnostics of photoevaporative winds. This work provides a critical first step toward interpreting spatially resolved H2 winds and motivates future modeling efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular diversity as a biosignature</a><span class="id">[2511.00525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for life in the Solar System hinges on data from planetary missions. Biosignatures based on molecular identity, isotopic composition, or chiral excess require measurements that current and planned missions cannot provide. We introduce a new class of biosignatures, defined by the statistical organization of molecular assemblages and quantified using ecodiversity metrics. Using this framework, we analyze amino acid diversity across a dataset spanning terrestrial and extraterrestrial contexts. We find that biotic samples are consistently more diverse, and therefore distinct, from their sparser abiotic counterparts. This distinction holds for fatty acids as well, indicating that the diversity signal reflects a fundamental biosynthetic signature. It also proves persistent under space-like degradation. Relying only on relative abundances, this biogenicity assessment strategy is applicable to any molecular composition data from archived, current, and planned planetary missions. By capturing a fundamental statistical property of life's chemical organization, it may also transcend biosignatures that are contingent on Earth's evolutionary history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Loci. IX. Estimation of Stellar Parameters from CSST-like Photometry</a><span class="id">[2511.00591]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) will conduct a deep and wide imaging survey in the NUV-, u-, g-, r-, i-, z-, and y-bands. In this work, using theoretical data synthesized from the BOSZ spectra of Bohlin et al. (2017), along with observational data constructed from different sources, we present two methods for estimating stellar parameters from CSST-like photometry. One approach is to estimate metallicity [M/H] and surface gravity log g simultaneously by using the metallicity- and log g-dependent stellar loci. Tests with theoretical data (without photometric errors) result in precisions of 0.088 dex and 0.083 dex for [M/H] and log g, respectively. With 0.01 mag photometric errors, precision is degraded by about a factor of two, due to degeneracy in [M/H] and log g. Tests with observational data, although with larger photometric errors, result in precisions of 0.10 dex and 0.39 dex for [Fe/H] and log g, respectively, thanks to the strong correlation between stellar colors and log g in real data. The other approach is the giant-dwarf loci method to obtain classifications and metallicity estimates. With the same observational data, it achieves a better [Fe/H] precision of 0.084 dex, due to the stronger constraints imposed on log g. The method also performs well in distinguishing giants from dwarfs, particularly for red or metal-poor giants. This work demonstrates the clear potential of the CSST data, paving the way for stellar-parameter estimates for many billions of stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational signatures of outside-in accretion bursts in embedded protostars</a><span class="id">[2511.00668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Optical and infrared surveys have detected increasing numbers of disc accretion outbursts in young stars. Some models of these FU Ori-type events predict that the outburst should start at near- to mid-infrared wavelengths before an optical rise is detected, and this lag between infrared and optical bursts has been observed in at least two systems. Detecting and characterizing infrared precursors can constrain the outburst trigger region, and thus help identify the mechanism producing the outburst. However, because FU Ori objects are generally young and usually embedded in dusty protostellar envelopes, it is not clear whether or how well such infrared precursors can be detected in the presence of strong envelope extinction. To explore this question, we combine time-dependent outburst models of the inner disc with an outer dusty disc and protostellar envelope, and calculate the resulting spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D. We find that, for envelope mass infall rates about 10^{-5} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}, where rc is a characteristic inner radius for the infalling envelope, the infrared precursor is only apparent in the SED when viewed along the outflow cavity. At other inclinations, the precursor is most easily distinguished at infall rates of 10^{-6} Msun/yr (rc/30 au)^{-1/2}. We also show that far-IR and submm/mm monitoring can enable the indirect detection of precursor evolution long before the optical outburst, emphasizing the potential of long-wavelength monitoring for studying the earliest stages of protostar formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization Diagnostics Applied to Coronal Mass Ejections and the Background Solar Wind</a><span class="id">[2511.00714]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The ratio of radially to tangentially polarized Thomson-scattered white light provides a powerful tool for locating the 3D position of compact structures in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and the Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH) has been designed to take full advantage of this diagnostic capability. Interestingly, this same observable that establishes the position of transient blob-like structures becomes a local measure of the slope of the global falloff of density in the background solar wind. It is thus important to characterize the extent along the line of sight of structures being studied, in order to determine whether they are sufficiently compact for 3D positioning. In this paper, we build from analyses of individual lines of sight to three-dimensional models of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), allowing us to consider how accurately polarization properties of the transient and quiescent solar wind are diagnosed. In this way, we demonstrate the challenges and opportunities presented by PUNCH polarization data for various quantitative diagnostics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs in the K2 fields: detection by multiple dataset merging</a><span class="id">[2511.00726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>By using various data sources for the stellar fluxes in overlapping campaign fields and employing full time series modeling, we report the detection of the secondary eclipses of two brown dwarfs (CWW 89Ab = EPIC 219388192b and HSHJ 430b = EPIC 211946007b). The detections yielded timings in agreement with the orbital elements derived from the earlier radial velocity measurements and eclipse depths of 70+/-12 ppm (CWW 89Ab) and 852+/-123 ppm (HSHJ 430b). While the high depth in the Kepler waveband for HSHJ 430b is in agreement with the assumption that the emitted flux comes mostly from the internal heat source and the absorbed stellar irradiation, the case of CWW 89Ab suggests very high albedo, because of the lack of sufficient thermal radiation in the Kepler waveband. Assuming completely reflective dayside hemisphere, without circulation, the maximum value of the eclipse depth due to the reflection of the stellar light is 56 ppm. By making the extreme assumption that the true eclipse depth is 3 sigma less than the observed depth, the minimum geometric albedo becomes  0.6.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavitation instability in unmagnetized relativistic pair shocks</a><span class="id">[2511.00742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the formation of plasma cavities in unmagnetized relativistic pair shocks and demonstrate that these cavities emerge naturally as a nonlinear consequence of asymmetric Weibel instability.

In this study, we carry out a cosmographic investigation using the latest compilations of Type Ia supernovae (PantheonPlus, DESY5, and Union3), baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from DESI-DR2, and updated strong lensing distance ratios. The cosmographic series is expanded to fourth order in the variable $y = z/(1+z)$ to constrain the deceleration, jerk, and snap parameters $(q_0,~j_0,~s_0)$. The analysis utilizes the distance sum rule (DSR) to provide an independent assessment of the spatial curvature parameter, $\Omega_{k0}$, without assuming a specific dynamical model. Our results based on SGL distance ratio measurements combined with individual supernova datasets suggest a mild preference for an open universe, though a flat universe is supported at the 95% confidence level. Further, the inclusion of DESI-DR2 data in each combination provides tighter constraints on the parameters and confirms flatness within the 68% confidence level as expected in standard cosmology. The results for $q_0$ and $j_0$ are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM predictions across datasets, while the constraint on $s_0$ remains limited but improves with the inclusion of DESI-DR2.

There is a great opportunity for current and future all-sky extra-galactic radio surveys to make use of this technique to test for non-Gaussianity at a precision greater than existing all-sky constraints from the cosmic microwave background. To realize this goal there is a need for accurate simulations. Previous radio galaxy simulations have either been realistic but covering only a small area (and so unhelpful for cosmological forecasts), or all-sky dark matter only cosmological simulations but having no connection to a real radio galaxy population. In this study, we use the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological surveys, as well as the matching of dark matter halos to radio galaxy population, to create an accurate sky simulation in order to examine the feasibility of multi-tracer techniques. We present an analysis of the clustering (with a bias model for the simulation), as well as redshift distributions, source counts and radio luminosity functions, and discuss future work on non-Gaussianity detection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits of self-interacting neutrinos from the BAO and CMB phase shift</a><span class="id">[2511.00800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrinos with Standard Model interactions free-stream in the early Universe, leaving a distinct phase shift in the pattern of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). When isolated, this phase shift allows one to robustly infer the presence of the cosmic neutrino background in BAO and cosmic microwave background (CMB) data independently of other cosmological parameters. While in the context of the Standard Model, this phase shift follows a known scale-dependent relation, new physics in the cosmic neutrino background could alter the overall shape of this feature. In this paper, we discuss how changes in the neutrino phase shift could be used to constrain self-interactions among neutrinos. We produce simple models for this phase-shift assuming universal self-interactions, and use these in order to understand what constraining power is available for the strength of such interactions in BAO and CMB data. We find that, although challenging, it may be possible to use a detection of the phase to put a more robust limit on the strength of the self-interaction, $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which at present suffers from bimodality in cosmological constraints. Our forecast analysis reveals that BAO data alone will not provide the precision needed to tightly constrain self-interactions; however, the combined analysis of the phase shift signature in both CMB and BAO can potentially provide a way to detect the impact of new neutrino interactions. Our results could be extended upon for models with non-universal interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia and IRTF abundance of A-type main belt asteroids</a><span class="id">[2511.00902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Missing Mantle Problem refers to the apparent scarcity of olivine rich (A-type) asteroids in the main belt, despite expectations that such bodies should be common if differentiated parent bodies were widely disrupted. Conversely, A-types appear relatively more abundant among near-Earth asteroids. We present a revised estimate of the A-type abundance in the main belt by combining Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) reflectance spectra with near-infrared observations from NASA IRTF. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to Gaia DR3 visible spectra to identify A-type candidates and confirmed a subset through IRTF spectroscopy. Using these data and literature results, we derived the A-type probability distribution as a function of DR3 principal components, and from this, estimated their abundance across heliocentric distances and collisional families. We find that A-types constitute (2.00 +/- 0.15)% of main-belt asteroids significantly higher than previous estimates. Some families, such as Vesta and Flora, show enhanced A-type fractions, while others (e.g. Themis, Hygiea) contain few or none. The elevated abundance in the Flora family supports the existence of an additional differentiated parent body in the inner belt, besides Vesta. These findings indicate that olivine-rich material is more widespread than previously thought, offering new constraints on the Missing Mantle Problem and on early Solar System differentiation processes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for GeV-scale Dark Matter from the Galactic Center with IceCube-DeepCore</a><span class="id">[2511.00918]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Models describing dark matter as a novel particle often predict that its annihilation or decay into Standard Model particles could produce a detectable neutrino flux in regions of high dark matter density, such as the Galactic Center. In this work, we search for these neutrinos using $\sim$9 years of IceCube-DeepCore data with an event selection optimized for energies between 15 GeV to 200 GeV. We considered several annihilation and decay channels and dark matter masses ranging from 15 GeV up to 8 TeV. No significant deviation from the background expectation from atmospheric neutrinos and muons was found. The most significant result was found for a dark matter mass of 201.6 GeV annihilating into a pair of $b\bar{b}$ quarks assuming the Navarro-Frenk-White halo profile with a post-trial significance of $1.08 \;\sigma$. We present upper limits on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section of the order of $10^{-24} \mathrm{cm}^3 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, as well as lower limits on the dark matter decay lifetime up to $10^{26} \mathrm{s}$ for dark matter masses between 5 GeV up to 8 TeV. These results strengthen the current IceCube limits on dark matter masses above 20 GeV and provide an order of magnitude improvement at lower masses. In addition, they represent the strongest constraints from any neutrino telescope on GeV-scale dark matter and are among the world-leading limits for several dark matter scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Onset of habitable conditions on the Hadean Earth set by feedback between tides and greenhouse forcing</a><span class="id">[2511.00952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the aftermath of the Moon-forming giant impact, the Hadean Earth's mantle and surface crystallized from a global magma ocean blanketed by a dense volatile-rich atmosphere. While prior studies have explored the thermal evolution of such early Earth scenarios under idealized, oxidizing conditions, the potential feedback between tidal heating driven by Earth–Moon orbital forcing and variable redox scenarios have not yet been explored in detail. We investigate whether tidal heating could have prolonged this early magma ocean phase and supported quasi-steady state epochs of global radiative equilibrium: periods of thermal balance between outgoing radiation and interior heat flux. Using the $\texttt{PROTEUS}$ simulation framework, we simulate Earth's early evolution under a range of plausible tidal power densities, oxygen fugacities, and volatile inventories. Our results suggest that feedback between tidal heating and atmospheric forcing can induce substantial variation in magma ocean lifetimes, from $\sim$30 Myr up to $\sim$500 Myr, sensitive to interior redox conditions. Global radiative equilibrium epochs commonly arise across this range, lasting from $\sim$2 to $\sim$320 Myr, and typically occur from 24 Myr after the Moon-forming impact. Under oxidizing conditions, late-stage H$_2$O degassing promotes melt retention and sustained heating due to its significant contribution to greenhouse forcing. Weak tides increase the atmospheric abundance of H$_2$S and NH$_3$ and deplete CO. Therefore, the feedback between tides and atmospheric forcing induces a disequilibrium signature in the magma ocean atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lu and Hamilton model for solar flares over a rewiring complex network</a><span class="id">[2511.00972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a modified Lu &amp; Hamilton-type model where the neighborhood relations are replaced by topological connections, which can be dynamically altered. The model represents each grid node as a flux tube, as in the classic model, but with connections evolving to capture the complex effects of magnetic reconnection. Through this framework, we analyze how the dissipated energy distribution changes, particularly focusing on the power-law exponent $\alpha_E$, which decreases with respect to the original model due to rewiring effects. When the system is dominated by rewiring, it presents an exponential distribution exponent $\beta_E$, showing a faster decay of dissipated energy than in the original model. This leads to microflare-dominated dynamics at short timescales, causing the system to lose the scale-free behavior observed in both the original model (Lu &amp; Hamilton 1991) and in configurations where energy release is primarily driven by forcing rather than rewiring. Our results reveal a clear transition from power-law to exponential regimes as the rewiring probability increases, fundamentally altering the energy distribution characteristics of the system. In contrast, when considering topological neighbors instead of local ones, the model's dynamics become intrinsically nonlocal. This leads to scaling exponents comparable to those reported in other nonlocal dynamical systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Massive neutrinos and interacting dark matter look alike through the lens of lensing</a><span class="id">[2511.01048]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We demonstrate that the suppression in the lensing power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) caused by massive neutrinos can be mimicked by dark matter-baryon interactions at the precision of next-generation CMB experiments.

The observed high-energy neutrino emission indicates the presence of a hadronic component, along with strong gamma-ray absorption, likely via pair production, and efficient particle acceleration. In this work, we investigate turbulence-driven magnetic reconnection as a mechanism for particle acceleration in the coronal accretion flow surrounding the central black hole. We develop a one-zone model for both acceleration and emission, following the framework of de Gouveia Dal Pino and Lazarian (2005) and Kadowaki et al. (2015) to explore how fast magnetic reconnection in the inner coronal disk region accelerates protons and electrons, shaping the spectral energy distribution (SED). Our model incorporates strong pair production attenuation and interactions with optical, ultraviolet (OUV), and X-ray photon fields in the corona, which serve as effective targets for proton interactions. Unlike recent studies, we find that particle acceleration to the extreme energies required to explain observations is primarily driven by first-order Fermi acceleration within the turbulent reconnection layers in a large scale current sheet, rather than by drift acceleration. Additionally, we demonstrate that accelerated protons primarily lose energy through photopion interactions with the OUV background, subject to important constraints from the coronal X-ray emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strange Matter</a><span class="id">[2511.01146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar-like objects are extremely compact, with an average density that exceeds nuclear saturation density, where the fundamental strong interaction plays an essential role, particularly in the low-energy regime. The internal structures and properties of those objects are profoundly connected to phenomena such as supernova explosions, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts, high/low-mass compact stars, and even to issues like dark matter and cosmic rays. However, due to the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics, significant uncertainties remain in our current understanding of the composition and equation of state (EOS) for the dense matter inside them. Drawing on three-flavour symmetry and the strong coupling between light quarks, this paper presents a novel perspective on the nature of pulsars: they are actually composed of strange matter, in the form of either strange quark matter or strangeon (analogous to nucleons and representing multibaryon states with three-flavour symmetry) matter. As both strange quark matter and strangeon matter contain non-zero strangeness, we refer to them collectively as “strange matter”, and to the corresponding compact stars as “strange stars”. We then briefly introduce several physical models describing strange matter and present the resulting structures and properties of strange stars. This includes discussions on the EOSs, surface properties, mass-radius relations, glitches, binary compact star mergers, and dark matter. Furthermore, we will explore how observational properties of pulsar-like objects support the strange star model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of Seven Cold and Distant Brown Dwarfs with JWST RUBIES</a><span class="id">[2511.01167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report near-infrared spectral model fits to seven distant L- and T-type dwarfs observed with the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) as part of the Red Unknowns: Bright Infrared Extragalactic Survey (RUBIES). Comparison of 0.9-2.5 $\mu$m near-infrared spectra of these sources to spectral standards indicates spectral types spanning L1 to T8, and spectrophotometric distances spanning 800-3,000 pc. Fits to three grids of spectral models yield atmosphere parameters and spectrophotometric distances largely consistent with our classifications, although fits to L dwarf spectra indicate missing components to the models. Three of our sources have vertical displacements from the Galactic plane exceeding 1 kpc, and have high probabilities of membership in the Galactic thick disk population. Of these, the L dwarf RUBIES-BD-3 (RUBIES-EGS-3081) is well-matched to subdwarf standards, while the early T dwarf RUBIES-BD-5 (RUBIES-UDS-170428) is best fit by metal-poor atmosphere models; both many be a thick disk or halo brown dwarfs. We critically examine the 1-5 $\mu$m spectra of the current sample of 1-2 kpc mid- and late-T dwarfs, finding that temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and vertical mixing efficiency can all contribute to observed variations in near-infrared spectral structure and the strength of the 4.2 $\mu$m CO band. This work aims to guide ongoing JWST, Euclid, and other space-based spectral surveys that are expected to uncover thousands of low-temperature stars and brown dwarfs throughout the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limits on forming coreless terrestrial worlds in the TRAPPIST-1 system</a><span class="id">[2511.01231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With seven temperate Earth-sized planets revolving around an ultracool red dwarf, the nearby TRAPPIST-1 system offers a unique opportunity to verify models of exoplanet composition, differentiation, and interior structure. In particular, the low bulk densities of the TRAPPIST-1 planets, compared to terrestrial planets in our solar system, require either substantial amount of volatiles to be present or a corefree scenario where the metallic core is fully oxidised. Here, using an updated metal-silicate partitioning model, we show that during core-mantle differentiation oxygen becomes more siderophile (iron-loving) implying larger planet radii. For the seven TRAPPIST-1 planets, however, we find that they are not sufficiently large to oxidise all the iron in the core, if they differentiate from an Earth-like composition. Oxygen partitioning in rocky worlds precludes coreless planets up to about 4 Earth masses. The observed density deficit in the TRAPPIST-1 planets, and more generally in M dwarf systems if confirmed by future observations, may be explained by system-dependent element budgets during planet formation, which are intrinsically linked to their stellar metallicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast End-to-End Framework for Cosmological Parameter Inference from CMB Data Using Machine Learning</a><span class="id">[2511.01291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precise estimation of cosmological parameters from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) remains a central goal of modern cosmology and a key test of inflationary physics. However, this task is fundamentally limited by strong foreground contamination, primarily from Galactic emissions, which obscure the faint CMB B-mode polarization signal. In this Letter, we introduce a fast, simulation-based, end to end pipeline that integrates a robust component separation technique with machine-learning, leading to cosmological parameter estimation. Our approach combines the Analytical Blind Separation (ABS) method for foreground removal with a neural network (NN) framework optimized to extract cosmological parameters directly from full-sky simulations. We assess the performance of this methodology for the forthcoming LiteBIRD and PICO satellite missions, designed to detect CMB B modes with unprecedented sensitivity. Applying the pipeline to realistic sky simulations, we obtain 1 sigma errors of 0.0035 (LiteBIRD) and 0.0030 (PICO) for the optical depth tau, and 0.005 (LiteBIRD) and 0.0014 (PICO) for the tensor-to-scalar ratio, r. In all cases, the recovered parameters are consistent with input values within 1 sigma across most of the parameter space. Results for LiteBIRD are in excellent agreement with the latest forecasts from the collaboration. Our findings establish this combined ABS-NN pipeline as a competitive, accurate, and computationally efficient alternative for cosmological parameter inference, offering a powerful framework for forthcoming CMB experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the nature and Galactic origin of the Be binary MWC 656. New insights from VLA, Gaia, and Fermi-LAT</a><span class="id">[2511.01483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The binary star MWC 656 was initially proposed as the first confirmed system composed of a Be star and a black hole. However, recent studies have challenged this interpretation, suggesting that the compact companion is unlikely to be a black hole. In this study, we revisit the nature of MWC 656 by analyzing archival data across multiple wavelengths, including radio observations from the VLA, optical astrometry from the Gaia satellite, and high-energy $\gamma$-ray data from the Fermi-LAT. Using all available VLA observations at X-band (8.0-12.0 GHz), we produce the deepest radio map toward this system to date, with a noise level of 780 nJy beam$^{-1}$. The source MWC 656 is detected with $S_\nu=4.6\pm0.8\mu$Jy and a spectral index of $\alpha=1.2\pm1.8$, derived by sub-band imaging. The radio and X-ray luminosity ratio of MWC 656 is consistent with both the fundamental plane of accreting black holes and with the Güdel-Benz relation for magnetically active stars, leaving the emission mechanism ambiguous. The optical astrometric results of MWC 656 indicate a peculiar velocity of $11.2\pm2.3$ km s$^{-1}$, discarding it as a runaway star. Its current location, 442 pc below the Galactic plane, implies a vertical travel time incompatible with the lifetime of a B1.5-type star. Moreover, the agreement between observed and expected motion in all three velocity components argues against a deceleration scenario, suggesting that MWC 656 likely formed in situ at high Galactic latitude. We carried out maximum likelihood analysis of Fermi-LAT data, but cannot report a significant detection of $\gamma$-ray emission from this source. These results reinforce recent evidence that challenge the black hole companion interpretation, and favor a non-BH compact object such as a white dwarf or neutron star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Velocity field of an Active Region filament from GRIS IR He I and IRIS UV observations</a><span class="id">[2511.01494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Plasma flow measurements in solar active region filaments are rare, particularly in the infrared and ultraviolet ranges that probe the chromosphere and transition region. In addition, previous studies generally focused on prominences and filaments near the solar limb. This study presents a multi-wavelength, multi-instrument analysis of an active region filament observed on the solar disk on November 9 and 10, 2020. Our goal is to characterize the plasma flows in the filament using spectroscopic measurements in both the infrared and ultraviolet spectral ranges. This is important for understanding the mechanisms for filament support, mass loading, and energy balance. Furthermore, this also offers observational benchmarks for filament modeling and simulations. Spectra from the IRIS satellite, including the Mg II k, C II and Si IV lines were analyzed alongside ground-based observations from the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph and High-resolution Fast Imager instruments whose observed spectral ranges include the chromospheric He I and H{\alpha} lines. Persistent blueshifts were measured within the filament structure in both spectral ranges. These can be interpreted as upflow velocities ranging from 0.5 to 15 km s^-1, with the Si IV showing the highest values. Red shifted emission in the He I and Mg II k3 at the footpoints of a newly formed dark bundle suggest chromospheric downflows, likely due to spatial overlap between an arch filament system close to the filament footpoints. The weak redshifted signal in the Si IV emission may suggest confinement to lower atmospheric layers. The observed velocity patterns provide, for the first time, a comprehensive and coherent view of the plasma dynamics from the chromosphere to the transition region, illustrating that the filament emission is consistently blueshifted in all the spectral windows, and thus in different temperature regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Populations of tidal and pulsating variables in eclipsing binaries</a><span class="id">[2511.01508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we seek to characterise a large sample of 14377 main sequence eclipsing binaries in terms of their stellar, asteroseismic, and orbital properties. We conduct manual vetting on a 4000-target subset of our full 14377-target sample to identify targets with pressure or gravity modes. We infer stellar properties including the mass, convective core mass, radius, and central H fraction for the primary using Gaia Data Release 3 effective temperature and luminosity estimates and a grid of asteroseismically calibrated stellar models. We use surface brightness ratio and radius ratio estimates from previous eclipse analysis to study the effect of binarity on our results. Our manual vetting identifies 751 candidate g-mode pulsators, 131 p-mode pulsators, and a further 48 hybrid pulsators. The inferred stellar properties of the hybrid and p-mode pulsators are highly correlated, while the orbital properties of the hybrid pulsators align best with the g-mode pulsators. The g-mode pulsators themselves show a distribution that peaks around the classical g dor instability region but extends continuously towards higher masses, with no detectable divide between the classical g dor and SPB instability regions. There is evidence at the population level for a heightened level of tidal efficiency in stars showing g-mode or hybrid variability. Correcting the primary mass inference for binarity based on eclipse measurements of the surface brightness and radius ratios results in a relatively small shift towards lower masses. This work provides a working initial characterisation of this sample from which more detailed analyses folding in asteroseismic information can be built. It also provides a foundational understanding of the limitations and capabilities of this kind of rapid, scalable analysis that will be highly relevant in planning the exploitation of future large-scale binary surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of Joy's Law in the context of Near-Surface Convection on the Sun</a><span class="id">[2511.01511]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Joy's law is a well-established statistical property of solar active regions that any theory of active region emergence must explain.

This secular precession of the binary orbit's major axis depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the two stars. Its rate is directly related to the internal structure of the stars, in particular their inner density profile. Combining radial velocity and light curve data over a long timescale, the apsidal motion rate can be constrained, together with the fundamental parameters of the stars. Confrontation of observational parameters to stellar models then allows us to constrain the internal structure of stars. This powerful technique has been known for years but has been seldom applied to massive stars. I highlight its interest and reveal recent results concerning several massive binaries. While standard stellar models predict stars having a smaller internal stellar structure constant, that is to say, stars having a smaller density contrast, than expected from observations, I demonstrate that the addition of mixing inside the models helps to solve, at least partially, this discrepancy. Studies with the non-perturbative code MoBiDICT showed that the perturbative model assumption is not justified in highly distorted stars, in which cases the apsidal motion is underestimated, exacerbating even more the need for enhanced mixing inside the models. But what happens if the binary is a double-line spectroscopic but non-eclipsing binary? In that case, we indeed have no estimate of the masses and radii of the stars. Surprisingly, the apsidal motion equations combined with the binary' spectroscopic observations allow us to derive the masses of the stars, in a model-dependent way. Rodolfo Barbá contributed to the development of this original method that I bring out.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exoplanet climate characterization with transit asymmetries – A comprehensive population study from the optical to the infrared</a><span class="id">[2511.01548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Space missions (CHEOPS, JWST, PLATO) facilitate detailed characterization of exoplanets. This work provides a framework to characterize cloud and climate properties of close-in gas giants via transit depth asymmetries from the optical to the infrared (0.33 ...10 $\mu$m). The AFGKM ExoRad 3D GCM grid provides gas temperature profiles for an ensemble of 50 tidally locked gaseous planets orbiting diverse host stars. It is combined with a detailed kinetic cloud formation model. The end result is a set of synthetic transit spectra and evening-to-morning transit asymmetries that span climate regimes: warm (T=800 K ... 1000K), intermediately hot (T=1200 K ... 2000 K) and ultrahot (T =2200 K ... 2600 K). WASP-39b observations suggest iron-free clouds with less abundant cloud condensation nuclei than previously expected. The ensemble study shows that clouds increase transit limb differences due to asymmetries in cloud coverage and by enhancing horizontal differences in the gas temperatures. For hot planets, evening-to-morning differences of up to 150 ppm are suggested in the optical and 100 ppm in the infrared (2-8 micron). For ultra-hot Jupiters, evening-to-morning transit differences are dominated by the morning cloud for a cloud-free evening limb: They are strongly negative in the PLATO band (0.5-1 $\mu$m, -500 ppm), moderately negative in the near-infrared (1-1.5 $\mu$m, -200 ppm) and moderately positive (+100 ppm) for $\lambda &gt; 2\mu$m. For a partly cloudy evening terminator, the evening-to-morning transit asymmetry is moderately positive in the whole wavelength range. Warm Jupiter planets exhibit negligible transit asymmetries. PLATO and JWST transit asymmetry observations between 1-2 $\mu$m are optimal to characterize cloudy planetary atmospheres around K -A stars. JWST observations are most effective for M star planets with transit differences &gt; +500 ppm for 8-10 $\mu$m.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Swaying oscillations in Rayleigh-Bénard convection cast new light on solar convection</a><span class="id">[2511.01582]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Horizontally-periodic Boussinesq Rayleigh-Bénard Convection (RBC) is a simple model system to study the formation of large-scale structures in turbulent convective flows.

Based on data from TESS, Gaia DR3, and LAMOST DR10, we present a catalog of kinematic properties (i.e., Galactic positions, velocities, orbits, Galactic components, and kinematic age) as well as other basic stellar parameters for $\sim 660,000$ TESS stars. Our analysis of the kinematic catalog reveals that stars belonging to different Galactic components (i.e., thin disk, thick disk, halo and 12 streams in the disk) display distinctive kinematic and chemical properties. We also find that hot planets with period less then 10 days in the TESS sample favor thin disk stars compared to thick disk stars, consistent with previous studies. Furthermore, using the LAMOST multiple-epoch observations, we identify 41,445 stars exhibiting significant radial velocity variations, among which 7,846 are classified as binary stars. By fitting the radial velocity curves, we further derive orbital parameters (e.g., mass ratio, orbital period and eccentricity) for 297 binaries. The observed decreasing orbital eccentricity with shorting period reveals evidence of tidal circularization. The catalogs constructed in this work have laid a solid foundation for future work on the formation and evolution of stellar and planetary systems in different Galactic environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detailed spectroscopic and photometric analysis of the remarkable planet-hosting wide binary system HD 202772A/B</a><span class="id">[2511.01595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We conducted a detailed spectroscopic and photometric characterization of the planet-hosting wide binary HD 202772A/B. No planet has been detected around HD 202772B, whereas HD 202772A, more evolved than its companion and near the end of its main-sequence (MS) phase, hosts a transiting hot Jupiter. The system has one of the hottest components ($T_{\mathrm{eff}; A} \sim 6440$ K) and one of the largest surface gravity differences between components ($\Delta\log g_{A-B} \sim 0.4$ dex) among MS planet-hosting wide binaries. Using a global fit including our stellar parameters, radial velocities, and new TESS data, we derive refined properties of the planet orbiting HD 202772A, finding it to be the most irradiated hot Jupiter known in a wide binary. We also constrain the presence of additional transiting planets around HD 202772A and new transiting planets around HD 202772B using TESS photometry. We derive high-precision, strictly differential abundances for 27 species based on Gemini-GRACES spectra. HD 202772A shows lower lithium abundance (by 0.45 dex) relative to B, consistent with their stellar parameter differences. We also detect a small but significant enhancement in refractory elements in HD 202772A, particularly those with condensation temperatures above 1400 K (+0.018 $\pm$ 0.004 dex). We explored several scenarios to explain the observed chemical anomalies. Our analysis suggests that rocky planet engulfment, primordial inhomogeneities, and $\delta$ Scuti-related effects are unlikely to fully account for the chemical pattern. Instead, the differences observed in certain refractory elements might support atomic diffusion as the most plausible explanation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar cycle evolution of ICME sheath regions at 1 AU</a><span class="id">[2511.01609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) sheath regions at 1 AU across solar cycles 23, 24, and the rising phase of 25, focusing on their variability and turbulence in relation to upstream solar wind conditions and the global heliospheric state. Using a dataset of over 900 ICME sheath events, we apply statistical metrics such as the interquartile range (IQR) and the Turbulence Index (TI) to quantify variability and turbulence. The analysis compares full and rising phases of solar cycles and examines both local ICME parameters (e.g., sheath total pressure, non-radial flows) and global interplanetary indicators such as open solar flux (OSF). From SC23 to SC24, sheath total pressure and magnetic field strength decreased by over 40% and 25%, respectively, accompanied by reduced turbulence and variability. In contrast, the rising phase of SC25 shows increased magnetic complexity, particularly in non-radial field components, despite stable bulk parameters. Non-radial flow patterns also shift from tangentially dominated in SC23-SC24 to normal-dominated in SC25, suggesting changes in ICME orientation and sheath formation mechanisms. No significant correlation is found between OSF and sheath properties, indicating that local solar wind and ICME specific factors are the primary drivers of sheath evolution. The study reinforces the importance of upstream solar wind dynamics in relation to variations in plasma and magnetic field measured components of ICME sheaths. The derived trends in turbulence, magnetic orientation, and flow geometry suggest that sheath regions are sensitive indicators of solar cycle phase and should be considered as distinct, structured components in ICME modeling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is $Λ$CDM on the run?

Starting from first principles, we derive a differential expression for the number of emitted photons per unit grammage and photon energy for an ensemble of gyrating shower electrons. The calculation uses noted parameterizations of the electron state variable distributions in the shower to establish a scale for the photon footprint and, further, takes into account the propagation of emitted photons in the atmosphere. The computed fluxes at the position of the detector are used to estimate the detector acceptance and event rate using a bootstrap Monte Carlo procedure. For a 1 m radius and 70° half-aperture circular detector at an altitude between 20 to 30 km viewing the Earth's limb, we find acceptances at the 1 $\mathrm{m^2 sr}$ level and integral event rates of roughly 10 per month. These results indicate that X-ray geo-synchrotron emission is a promising, complimentary channel for high-altitude indirect cosmic ray detection in the PeV regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral curvature and breaks from Fermi acceleration at oblique shocks</a><span class="id">[2511.01635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A major attraction of diffusive shock acceleration is the prediction of power-law spectra for energetic particle distributions. However, this property is not fundamental to the theory. We demonstrate that for planar shocks with an oblique magnetic field the generation of power-law spectra critically requires the particles' scattering rate to be both directly proportional to their gyro radius (Bohm scaling) and spatially uniform. Non-Bohm scaling results in curved spectra at oblique shocks, while abrupt changes in the spatial profile of the scattering upstream introduces spectral breaks. Using the publicly available code Sapphire++, we numerically explore the magnitude of these effects, which are particularly pronounced at fast shocks, as expected in active galactic nuclei and microquasar jets, or young supernova remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double white dwarf ZTF J0538+1953 as the brightest verification binary for space laser interferometers</a><span class="id">[2511.01651]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A decrease in the orbital period of the ultrashort-period binary white dwarf \ZTF, which is one of the Galactic verification binaries in the millihertz frequency range for planned space laser interferometers, has been measured. Based on photometric observations carried out on the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute of Moscow State University (CMO SAI MSU), a diagram \textit{O-C} is constructed. It can be described by quadratic elements of the brightness variation, which correspond to a decrease rate of the orbital period of the system of $dP/dt=-(1.16\pm 0.22)\times 10^{-11}$ s/s. The decrease rate of the orbital period in the quadrupole approximation for the emission of gravitational waves by a binary system corresponds to its chirp mass $\mathcal{M}=0.434\pm 0.05 M_\odot$, which turned out to be $\sim 30\%$ higher than the value obtained earlier from spectroscopic mass determination. The chirp mass of \ZTF inferred from the measured orbital decay rate makes this system the brightest Galactic verification binary for LISA and TianQin space interferometers with a signal-to-noise ratio of $\approx 119$ and $\approx 30$ over 5 years and 2.5 years of observations, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01679" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observing the solar corona from a formation-flying mission.

The two spacecraft separated by around 144 m fly in a precise formation up to 5.5 hours at a time, which allows coronal observations in eclipse-like conditions, i.e. close to the limb (typically down to 1.099 Rs, occasionally down to 1.05 Rs) and with very low straylight. ASPIICS observes quasi-stationary structures, such as coronal loops, streamers, quiescent prominences, and a variety of dynamic phenomena: erupting prominences, coronal mass ejections, jets, slow solar wind outflows, coronal inflows. In particular, weak, widespread and persistent small-scale outflows and inflows between 1.3 and 3 Rs are observed at a high spatial (5.6 arcsec) and temporal (30 s) resolution for the first time, expanding the range of scales at which the variable slow solar wind is observed to form.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01700" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Dark Energy from a Massive Vector Field in Generalized Proca Theory</a><span class="id">[2511.01700]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we emphasise the recent observational findings from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2), which provide compelling evidence for a possible deviation from the standard $\Lambda$CDM (Cold Dark Matter) cosmology, suggesting the presence of a dynamically evolving effective dark energy component. Motivated by this, we construct a theoretical framework in which a massive cosmological vector field, $B^{\mu}$, couples non-minimally to the background curvature through marginal interactions, offering a controlled mechanism to realise the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. A detailed analysis of the effective Equation of State (EoS) parameter $w(\tilde H)$ reveals a narrow region of parameter space consistent with current cosmological observations presented by DESI. The analysis yields a stringent upper bound for the coupling constant $\lambda$ to be $\lambda&lt;2.98\times10^{-11}$, a very strong bound on mass $3.1356\times10^{-66}~\text{g} \leq m \leq 3.3627\times10^{-66}~\text{g},$ and the admissible range $-0.405 \leq \log_{10}\tilde\gamma \leq -0.38$ for which present-day value $w_0 = w(\tilde H = 1)$ corresponding to a deviation $\delta = w_0 + 1$ that lies within the region $0.107 \leq \delta \leq 0.217$. This interval reproduces the deviation inferred from the combined DESI, Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and Pantheon+ data, reflecting a controlled departure from the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour. In summary, the results suggest that the proposed framework of a massive vector field can account for the departure from $\Lambda$CDM behaviour highlighted by DESI in the current cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, the framework approaches the $\Lambda$CDM behaviour in late-time $t\gtrsim28$ Gyr, establishing a direct phenomenological link between the underlying parameters and the observed dynamical nature of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disk Evolution Study Through Imaging of Nearby Young Stars (DESTINYS): V721 CrA and BN CrA have wide and structured disks in polarised IR</a><span class="id">[2511.01717]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present near-infrared scattered-light observations of the disks around two stars of the Corona Australis star-forming region, V721 CrA, and BN CrA, obtained with VLT/SPHERE, in the H band, as part of the DESTINYS large programme.

This hierarchy can be naturally explained by $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, which after spontaneous symmetry breaking, simultaneously generates Majorana masses for neutrinos and produces a network of cosmic strings. Such strings generate a gravitational wave (GW) spectrum which is expected to be almost uniform in frequency unless there is a departure from the usual early radiation domination. We explore this possibility in Type I, II and III seesaw frameworks, finding that only for Type-I, long-lived right-handed neutrinos (RHN) may provide a period of early matter domination for parts of the parameter space, even if they are thermally produced. Such a period leaves distinctive imprints in the GW spectrum in the form of characteristic breaks and a knee feature, arising due to the end and start of the periods of RHN domination. These features, if detected, directly determine the mass $M$, and effective neutrino mass $\tilde m$ of the dominating RHN. We find that GW detectors like LISA and ET could probe RHN masses in the range $M\in[0.1,10^{9}]$ GeV and effective neutrino masses in the $\tilde m\in[10^{-10},10^{-8}]$ eV range. We investigate the phenomenological implications of long-lived right-handed neutrinos for both local and global $U(1)_{B-L}$ strings, focusing on dark matter production and leptogenesis. We map the viable and detectable parameter space for successful baryogenesis and asymmetric dark matter production from right-handed neutrino decays. We derive analytical and semi-analytical relations correlating the characteristic gravitational-wave frequencies to the neutrino parameters $\tilde m$ and $M$, as well as to the relic abundances of dark matter and baryons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$Λ$CDM: The path forward</a><span class="id">[2511.01814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current cosmological paradigm, $\Lambda$CDM, is characterized its expansive description of the history of the Universe, its deep connections to particle physics and the large amounts of data that support it.

Neutron stars provide a unique natural laboratory to probe this regime. In this work, we present EVA–01, a novel equation of state that provides a unified description of dense matter by incorporating both hadron and quark degrees of freedom within a single relativistic mean-field Lagrangian, from which the equation of state is derived at finite temperature. The model extends the density-dependent formalism by introducing a Polyakov-loop-inspired scalar field to dynamically govern the hadron-quark phase transition, following the approach of chiral mean-field models. The resulting model is consistent with a wide range of theoretical and observational constraints, including those from chiral effective field theory, massive pulsars, gravitational-wave events, and NICER data. We analyze its thermodynamic properties by constructing the QCD phase diagram, identifying the deconfinement, chiral, and nuclear liquid-gas transitions. As a first application, we model the evolution of proto-neutron stars using isentropic snapshots and explore the implications of the slow stable hybrid star hypothesis.

The origin of Mercury's large, iron-rich core remains unknown. Adding to this mystery, an elusive population of &quot;Exo-Mercuries&quot; with high densities is emerging. Therefore, understanding the formation of Mercury and its exoplanetary analogs is essential to developing a comprehensive planet formation theory. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the high CMF of Mercury: (1) giant impacts during the latest stages of planet formation strip away mantle layers, leaving Mercury with a large core; and (2) earlier-stage iron enrichment of planetesimals closer to the Sun leads to the formation of an iron-rich planet. In this work, we conduct N-body simulations to test these two possibilities. Our simulations are focused on the solar system, however, we aim to provide a framework that can later be applied to the formation of high-CMF exoplanets. To investigate the giant impact scenario, we employ uniform initial CMF distributions. To address the other hypothesis, we use a step function with higher CMFs in the inner region. For a uniform initial CMF distribution, our results indicate that although erosive impacts produce iron-rich particles, without mechanisms that deplete stripped mantle material, these particles merge with lower-CMF objects and do not lead to Mercury's elevated CMF. However, a step function initial CMF distribution leads to the formation of a high-CMF planet alongside Earth-like planets, resembling the architecture of the terrestrial solar system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01858" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chromosphere of the quiet sun - I. Shock and current-sheet dynamics and heating</a><span class="id">[2511.01858]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar chromosphere is a crucial interface between the solar interior and its interplanetary environment, regulating how energy is locally deposited into heat and transported into the upper atmospheric layers. Despite significant progress, the dominant processes responsible for chromospheric heating remain debated, particularly under quiet-Sun (QS) conditions. We aim to disentangle and quantify the respective roles of shocks and current sheets (CS) in QS chromospheric modeling. We use a simulation performed with the radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code Bifrost. In order to identify shocks and CS events across space and time, we develop and apply physics-based criteria, allowing us to describe their dynamics and evaluate their contributions to both dissipative (viscous and ohmic) and mechanical (including compressive work) heating. Shocks are found to dominate the energy deposition in the lower chromosphere (up to $59\%$ of the mechanical heating), while CS become the primary contributor in the upper chromosphere, as both plasma $\beta$ and Mach number $Ma$ drop. Overall, $66\%$ of the mechanical chromospheric heating is powered by the combined action of shocks and CS. These results support a multi-process view of the chromospheric heating in the QS, dominated by shocks, CS, and non-steep gradient dynamics. In addition to viscous and ohmic dissipation, compressive heating can play a major role locally in the model, particularly in chromospheric shock structures, where it offsets non-reversibly cooling from expansion and radiation, and therefore constitutes a key heating contribution to consider in the energy budget. This study further highlights the need for next-generation observations to resolve the intermittent and small-scale nature of chromospheric dynamics, in order to bring new constraints on the coupling between the different layers of the solar atmosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01859" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainties in the production of iron-group nuclides in core-collapse supernovae from Monte Carlo variations of reaction rates</a><span class="id">[2511.01859]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae, occurring at the end of massive star evolution, produce heavy elements, including those in the iron peak. Although the explosion mechanism is not yet fully understood, theoretical models can reproduce optical observations and observed elemental abundances. However, many nuclear reaction rates involved in explosive nucleosynthesis have large uncertainties, impacting the reliability of abundance predictions. To address this, we have previously developed a Monte Carlo-based nucleosynthesis code that accounts for reaction rate uncertainties and has been applied to nucleosynthesis processes beyond iron. Our framework is also well suited for studying explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae. In this paper, we investigate 1D explosion models using the &quot;PUSH method&quot;, focusing on progenitors with varying metallicities and initial masses around $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 16 M_{\odot}$. Detailed post-process nucleosynthesis calculations and Monte Carlo analyses are used to explore the effects of reaction rate uncertainties and to identify key reaction rates in explosive nucleosynthesis. We find that many reactions have little impact on the production of iron-group nuclei, as these elements are primarily synthesized in the nuclear statistical equilibrium. However, we identify a few &quot;key reactions&quot; that significantly influence the production of radioactive nuclei, which may affect astrophysical observables. In particular, for the production of ${}^{44}$Ti, we confirm that several traditionally studied nuclear reactions have a strong impact. However, determining a single reaction rate is insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$λϕ^4$ as an Effective Theory in de Sitter</a><span class="id">[2510.25826]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Effective field theories (EFTs) provide a powerful framework to parametrise unknown aspects of possible ultraviolet (UV) physics. For scalar fields in de Sitter space, however, new emergent phenomena can arise when the cut-off scale of the theory lies below the horizon scale $H$, as seen in the stochastic formalism of inflation. In this work, we study EFTs that, at leading order, reproduce the standard quartic theory in de Sitter, but with a variable cut-off identified with the mass of an integrated-out hidden sector. We perform the complete analytic computation for the tree- and loop-level matching between the effective $\lambda\phi^4$ theory and two possible UV realisations. We find that when the cut-off is much larger than the horizon, the theory admits a unitary description, up to exponentially suppressed corrections. In contrast, when the cut-off is lowered below $H$, the system evolves into a mixed state and diffusive effects emerge. Nevertheless, at leading order, the EFT remains local and reproduces the same effective quartic coefficient as in the unitary regime. Furthermore, for the EFT matching at the loop-level, the effective quartic coupling changes sign and becomes negative as the cut-off decreases, in agreement with the result obtained from the stochastic formalism. In general, for cosmological EFTs, our findings highlight the role of non-unitary effects and illustrate their regimes of validity, within and beyond perturbation theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rydberg Single Photon Detection for Probing 0.1-10 meV Dark Matter with BREAD</a><span class="id">[2511.00145]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a Rydberg-based single photon detector (SPD) for probing dark matter in the 0.1-10 meV mass range (20 GHz-2 THz).

These scale-breaking boundary equations come with a built-in memory kernel in momentum-kinematic space encapsulating the universe's evolution during inflation. Specialising to heavy fields with sinusoidal masses such as those found in axion monodromy scenarios, we show that a powerful synthesis of microcausality and analyticity allows an analytical solution of these equations at leading order in the amplitude of mass oscillations.

In this work, we perform a series of numerical relativity simulations to investigate the spin-up and mass-gain for equal-mass black holes with a wide range of equal initial spins, $\chi_{\rm i}\in[-0.7,0.7]$, aligned (or anti-aligned) to the orbital angular momentum. We also consider a variety of initial momenta. Furthermore, we explore a range of incident angles and identify the threshold between scattering and merging configurations. The spin-up and mass-gain are typically largest in systems with incident angles close to the threshold value, large momenta, and negative (i.e. anti-aligned) initial spins. When evaluated at the threshold angle, we find that the spin-up decreases linearly with initial spin. Intriguingly, systems with initial spin $\chi_{\rm i}=0.7$ sometimes experience a spin-down, in spite of an increase in the black-hole angular momentum, due to a corresponding gain in the black-hole mass. Across the simulation suite, we find a maximum spin-up of $0.3$ and a maximum increase in the black-hole mass of $15\%$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The thermal view of $f(R)$ cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.00347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new thermal view of scalar-tensor gravity, in which general relativity is the zero-temperature state of gravity, is applied to the specific subclass of $f(R)$ gravity theories and, specifically, to spatially homogeneous and isotropic universes.

The I-spin counterpart for the interactions among nucleons has been extensively investigated, i.e., the nuclear symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, which characterizes the variation of binding energy as the neutron to proton ratio in a nuclear system. In this work, we propose U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ for hyperonic matter to characterize the variation of the binding energy with the inclusion of hyperons. In particular, being the lightest hyperon, $\Lambda$ hyperons are included in dense matter, where the U-spin symmetry energy $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is fixed according to state-of-the-art constraints from nuclear physics and astrophysical observations using Bayesian inference approach. It is found that $E_\mathrm{U}(n_\mathrm{b})$ is much smaller than that of $E_\mathrm{sym}(n_\mathrm{b})$, indicating much stronger proton-neutron attraction than that of nucleon-hyperon pairs. Consequently, $\Lambda$ hyperon potential increases significantly and becomes repulsive at large density, where there is more than 80\% probability that $\Lambda$ hyperons do not emerge in neutron stars. For those undergoing emergence within neutron stars, the onset density of $\Lambda$ hyperons $n_\mathrm{b}^\Lambda$ is typically larger than $\sim$0.8 fm$^{-3}$, corresponding to neutron stars more massive than 1.7 $M_\odot$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black holes in a dense infinite medium: a toy-model regularizing the Schwarzschild metric</a><span class="id">[2511.01326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the dynamics of a black hole accreting energy from a surrounding homogeneous and infinite space.

We argue that the signal is governed by the effective coupling $\beta_{\text{eff}} \equiv \beta_{\gamma}M_e^{-4}$, which encodes the combined effects of production and detection, where $\beta_{\gamma}$ and $M_e$ are the chameleon-photon (conformal) coupling and chameleon-electron disformal coupling scale, respectively.

This limit is independent of the conformal matter coupling $\beta_m$ and index $n$, and applies to the whole class of inverse power-law chameleons, well beyond the $n=1$ case usually studied. We comment on how future multi-target experiments and lower-threshold analyses could distinguish solar chameleons from other light (pseudo)scalar particles such as axions.

However, such theories often confront hierarchy problems in the absence of a symmetry. Self-completion via classicalization offers a non-Wilsonian approach to ultraviolet (UV) completion, wherein new scalar self-interactions involving derivatives give rise to Vainshtein-like screening around energy-momentum sources. Rather than introducing new UV degrees of freedom to restore unitarity at high energies, these theories reshuffle their infrared (IR) degrees of freedom by generating extended semi-classical objects – referred to as classicalons – which decay into a multitude of soft particles. This mechanism incorporates non-localizable fields, thereby realizing a form of UV/IR mixing that is analogous to the dynamics of black holes in gravitational theories. In this article, having reviewed the fundamental principles of classicalization with a simple k-essence model, we then argue the necessity of maintaining a little hierarchy between the scalar mass and the scale of the first new resonances, thereby illustrating the impact of UV/IR mixing on hierarchy problems. Additionally, we investigate the effects of a scalar potential and couplings to fermions on the Vainshtein screening mechanism. We discuss that a chameleon-like screening mechanism must accompany the Vainshtein screening to preserve the integrity of classicalon solutions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High energy power-law tail in X-ray binaries spectrum and bulk Comptonization due to a conical outflow from a disk</a><span class="id">[1708.04427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray binaries (XRBs) often exhibit a high energy power-law tail (HEP-tail) and these tails can be generated by the bulk Comptonization (BMC) process with a free-fall bulk region onto the compact object. The radio emission (which is generated by a synchrotron-emitting outflowing electrons) is observed in all spectral state of XRBs. Interestingly, the variations of HEP-tail flux among different spectral states is similar to the variation of radio flux. We motivate to study the HEP-tail in BMC process with an outflowing medium. For this we consider a collimated and conical (of opening angle $\theta_b$ with axis perpendicular to the accretion disk) outflow geometry. We simulate the BMC spectrum by using a Monte Carlo scheme. We find that the emergent spectrum has power-law tail (of photon index $\Gamma$ $&gt;$ 2 and with high energy cut-off $E_{c}$ $&gt;$ 200 keV) only for $\theta_b$ greater than $\sim$30 degrees in conical outflow, while for a collimated or a conical outflow ($\theta_b$ $&lt;$ 30 degrees) these HEP-tail can be only generated when it is also found in thermal Comptonized spectra (i.e., at sufficiently high Comptonizing medium temperature). These results are approximately consistent with analytically derived expressions. We describe the observed GRS 1915+105 spectrum for two classes $\chi$ and $\gamma$ in conical outflow, for this the outflow speed is highly relativistic and the kinetic power of wind suggest that the HEP-tail can be generated at inner region of the accretion disk, like inner disk radio emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Census of NUV M-Dwarf Flares Using Archival GALEX Data and the gPhoton2 Pipeline</a><span class="id">[2306.17045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>M-dwarfs are common stellar hosts of habitable-zone exoplanets.

The GALEX observations form the most extensive dataset of M-dwarfs in the NUV to date, with exploitation of this data possible due to the new gPhoton2 pipeline. We run a dedicated algorithm to detect flares in the pipeline produced lightcurves and find some of the most energetic flares observed to date within the NUV bandpass, with energies of $\sim10^{34}$ ergs. Using GALEX data, we constrain flare frequency distributions for stars from M0 to M6 in the NUV up to $10^5\,$s in equivalent duration and $10^{34}$ ergs in energy, orders of magnitude above any previous study in the UV. We speculate the combined effect of NUV luminosities and flare rates of M4 and later stars could potentially allow abiogenesis on their habitable zone exoplanets. As a counterpoint, we estimate that the high frequencies of energetic UV flares and associated coronal mass ejections would inhibit the formation of an ozone layer, possibly preventing genesis of complex Earth-like lifeforms due to sterilizing levels of surface UV radiation.

For both phenomenologies our results show that the total relativistic signal surpasses cosmic variance (considering an SKA2-like sky coverage) in the magnification angular power spectrum at low redshifts ($z\lesssim 0.5$), hence cosmic-variance reduction methods like multi-tracer analysis will not be needed for surveys at the given $z$. For the individual relativistic signals, we found that the Doppler magnification signal also surpasses cosmic variance and remains the dominant signal, at low $z$, for both phenomenologies. However, the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational (potential) magnification signals, respectively, are subdominant to both the Doppler magnification signal and cosmic variance, at the same $z$; hence multi-tracer analysis will be needed to isolate these signals. At high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 3$), the integrated-Sachs-Wolfe, the time-delay, and the gravitational magnification signals, respectively, appear to surpass cosmic variance and dominate over the Doppler magnification signal for constant phenomenology; whereas for dynamic phenomenology, all these signals diminish significantly and are well below cosmic variance, at all $z$ (consistent with recent quintessence analysis).

We show that the intrinsic polarization degree (PD) is variable with the orbital period with the amplitude of $\sim0.3\%$ at least in the $R$ band, where the signal-to-noise ratio of our observations is the best. This implies that some fraction of the optical polarization is produced by a scattering of stellar radiation off the matter that follows the black hole in its orbital motion. In addition, we see a rotation of the orbit-average intrinsic polarization angle (PA) with the wavelength from $163°$ in the $R$ to $177°$ in the $B$ band. All of the above, combined with the historical NIR-to-optical polarimetric observations, demonstrates the complex behavior of the average intrinsic polarization of A0620-00: the PA continuously rotates from the infrared to the blue band by $\sim53°$ in total, while the PD of $\sim1\%$ remains nearly constant over the entire spectral range. The spectral dependence of the PA can be described by Faraday rotation with the rotation measure of RM=$-0.2$ rad $\mu$m$^{-2}$, implying a few Gauss magnetic field in the plasma surrounding the black hole accretion disk. However, our preferred interpretation of the peculiar wavelength dependence is an interplay between two polarized components with different PAs. Polarimetric measurements in the UV range can help in distinguishing between these scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background: HR-DEMNUni simulation analysis</a><span class="id">[2407.13727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the high-resolution HR-DEMNUni simulations to compute cross-correlations of the Cosmic Neutrino Background quantities, like neutrino density, deflection angle, and velocity, with other quantities, like cold dark matter density and effective weak lensing convergence, by accounting for the space-time delay between signals on Earth.

Wind is inevitable in LLAGNs, mainly interpreted in an indirect way, also the evidence is growing for the presence of wind in the outer thin disk. We present a hydrodynamics (HD) model for wind from the outer thin disk, where the main driver is the inner disk irradiation (which is parameterized by a number $x$ in hydrostatic equilibrium equation) and the heating mechanism is photoionization. The model works for low-intensity irradiation or from a height $z_s$ in the optically thin medium. We solve the model equations in cylindrical coordinates along the $z$-axis for a given radius $r$ with assuming a tiny vertical speed $v_z$ ($\ll c_s$ sound speed). The sonic point conditions assure an isobaric regime above the sonic height ($z^{max}$); in addition to the height $z_f (\ll z^{max}$), the radial pressure gradient also supports the fluid rotation, and both jointly assure a wind ejection from the $z^{max}$ with fluid speed. The $z^{max}$ increases with $x$, and beyond a large $z^{max}$ (say $z^{max}_t$ corresponding to maximum $x$), there is no physical solution. We start the computation from the outer radius $r_o^{thin}$ to the inner $r_{in}^{thin}$ with a Bondi mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_{Bondi}$, to explore the $r$ dependency of the mass inflow rate $\dot{M}$ and wind properties. We constrain the model by fixing $\dot{M}$ at $r_{in}^{thin}$ from the observations of NGC 1097 and check the feasibility of the model by comparing the energetics with the observed bolometric luminosity.

This correction allows for a unified description of primordial and late-time accelerated expansions. However, most existing models struggle to achieve this, as they become unstable over certain negative ranges of the Ricci scalar, where either the first or second derivative of $F(R)$ turns negative. These instabilities may disrupt the post-inflationary evolution when the Ricci scalar oscillates about the vacuum state after the $R^2$ inflation. In this work, we introduce a new model-building to guarantee global stability, i.e., the first and second derivatives are positive for all real Ricci scalars. By extending the idea from Appleby and Battye, we demonstrate that viable models can be constructed by imposing a positive, bounded first derivative of $F(R)$ with a sigmoid shape. As examples, we first reformulate and generalize the original Appleby-Battye model. Then, we propose a new dark energy model, which successfully explains the acceleration of cosmic expansion and passes local gravity tests.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clustering and Runaway Merging in a Primordial Black Hole Dominated Universe</a><span class="id">[2412.01890]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>If primordial black holes (PBH) are present in the early universe, their contribution to the energy budget grows relative to that of radiation and generically becomes dominant unless the initial abundance is exponentially small. This black hole domination scenario is largely unconstrained for PBHs with masses $\lesssim 10^9\,\mathrm{g}$, which evaporate prior to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. However, if the era of PBH domination is sufficiently long, the PBHs form clusters and can merge appreciably within these objects. We calculate the population statistics of these clusters within the Press-Schechter formalism and find that, for a wide range of PBH masses and Hubble rates at the onset of PBH domination, the mergers within PBH clusters can exhibit runaway behavior, where the majority of the cluster will eventually form a single black hole with a mass much greater than the original PBH mass. These mergers can dramatically alter the PBH mass distribution and leave behind merged relic black holes that evaporate after Big Bang nucleosynthesis and yield various observational signatures, excluding parameter choices previously thought to be viable</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13304" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for a signature of turnaround in galaxy clusters with convolutional neural networks</a><span class="id">[2412.13304]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters are important cosmological probes that have helped to establish the $\mathrm{\Lambda}$CDM paradigm as the standard model of cosmology. However, recent tensions between different types of high-accuracy data highlight the need for novel probes of the cosmological parameters. Such a probe is the turnaround density: the mass density on the scale where galaxies around a cluster join the Hubble flow. To measure it, one must locate the distance from the cluster center where turnaround occurs. Earlier work has shown that a turnaround radius can be readily identified in simulations by analyzing the 3D dark matter velocity field. However, measurements using realistic data face challenges due to projection effects. This study aims to assess the feasibility of measuring the turnaround radius using machine learning techniques applied to simulated idealized observations of galaxy clusters. We employed N-body simulations across various cosmologies to generate galaxy cluster projections. Utilizing convolutional neural networks, we assessed the predictability of the turnaround radius based on galaxy line-of-sight velocity, number density, and mass profiles. We find a strong correlation between the turnaround radius and the central mass of a galaxy cluster, rendering the mass distribution outside the virial radius of little relevance to the model's predictive power. The velocity dispersion among galaxies also contributes valuable information concerning the turnaround radius. Importantly, the accuracy of a line-of-sight velocity model remains robust even when the data within the $\mathrm{R_{200}}$ of the central overdensity are absent. Single-cluster turnaround radius inference from projected observables seems to be highly challenging. Future progress is likely to require statistical approaches, especially stacking, to exploit cosmological information encoded at turnaround scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing Candidate Blazar Counterparts of the Ultra-High-Energy Event KM3-230213A</a><span class="id">[2502.08484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy astrophysical neutrinos serve as crucial messengers for understanding hadronic acceleration processes and identifying the origins of cosmic rays, with blazars among the most promising neutrino sources. The KM3NeT experiment reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino with an energy estimate of   220 PeV, the most energetic yet observed. The neutrino arrival direction has a 99% confidence region of 3° radius centered at RA 94.3°, Dec -7.8° (J2000). In this work, seventeen candidate blazars located within this region are identified. Comprehensive new observations and archival data analysis for these sources are presented. The study provides a complete multiwavelength coverage across radio, optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, including proprietary data and dedicated follow-up observations. This study highlights flaring behavior in several candidate counterparts. One object exhibits a radio flare coinciding with the neutrino arrival time, with a pre-trial chance probability of 0.26%. Another candidate displays a rising trend in X-ray flux in a one-year window around the neutrino arrival time, while a third undergoes a gamma-ray flare during the same period. Based on the observational findings here presented, while none of these candidates can conclusively be linked to the neutrino, the implications of a possible blazar origin for the KM3NeT event are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical constraints on the vertical structure of Jupiter's polar cyclones</a><span class="id">[2502.12789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Jupiter's poles feature striking polygons of cyclones that drift westward over time, a motion governed by beta-drift (vortex motion caused by the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis force). This study investigates how beta-drift and the resulting westward motion depend on the depth of these cyclones. Counterintuitively, shallower cyclones drift more slowly, a consequence of stronger vortex stretching. By employing a 2D quasi-geostrophic model of Jupiter's polar regions, we constrain the cyclones' deformation radius, a key parameter that serves as a proxy for their vertical extent, required to replicate the observed westward drift. We then explore possible vertical structures and the static stability of the poles by solving the eigenvalue problem that links the 2D model to a 3D framework, matching the constrained deformation radius. These findings provide a foundation for interpreting upcoming Juno microwave measurements of Jupiter's north pole, offering insights into the static stability and vertical structure of the polar cyclones. Thus, by leveraging long-term motion as a novel constraint on vertical dynamics, this work sets the stage for advancing our understanding of the formation and evolution of Jupiter's enigmatic polar cyclones.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Gravitational Wave Signals to Disentangle Early Matter Dominated Epochs</a><span class="id">[2503.03101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Curvature perturbations induce gravitational waves (GWs) at second order, contributing to the stochastic gravitational wave background. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum is sensitive to the evolutionary history of the universe and can be substantially enhanced by early matter-dominated (eMD) epochs, particularly if they end rapidly. Such epochs can be caused by primordial black holes (PBHs) and non-topological solitons (Q-balls), for example. Prior analysis approximated the end of the eMD epoch as instantaneous or used a Gaussian smoothing. In this work, we present a complete analysis fully incorporating their time-evolving decay rates. We demonstrate that the resulting signal spectra from PBH, thin wall Q-ball, thick wall Q-ball, and delayed Q-ball eMD epochs are distinguishable for monochromatic distributions. We then consider log-normal mass distributions and discuss the distinguishability of the various GW spectra. Importantly we find that the change in the spectrum from a finite mass width is qualitatively different from the change arising from a slower transition to radiation domination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FRB cosmology with the RM-PRS Luminosity Correlation</a><span class="id">[2504.15119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as a powerful tool for cosmological studies, particularly through the dispersion measure-redshift ($\mathrm{DM}-z$) relation.

We demonstrate that this approach provides independent constraints on cosmological parameters, bypassing limitations inherent to traditional $\mathrm{DM}-z$ method.

Combining YLZ-calibrated FRBs with $\mathrm{DM}-z$ sample reveals critical synergies: joint analysis of equalized samples ($N=100$ for both methods) reduces the relative uncertainty of $H_0$ to 2.9\%, mainly because the incorporation of PRS observations substantially mitigates the degeneracy between the parameters such as IGM baryon mass fraction ($f_{\rm IGM}$) and other cosmological parameters inherent to the $\mathrm{DM}-z$ relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Challenges Involved in the Detection of Gases in Exoplanet Atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2504.21788]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Claims of detections of gases in exoplanet atmospheres often rely on comparisons between models including and excluding specific chemical species.

Using the sub-Neptune K2-18 b as a case study, we show that recent biosignature claims vanish when the model space is expanded, with numerous alternatives providing equally good or better fits. We demonstrate that the significance of a claimed detection relies on the choice of models being compared, and that model preference does not in itself imply the presence of a specific gas.

A Bayesian inference procedure is adopted to estimate the models parameters that yield the best fit to the data. The EoS remains within the phantom regime at higher redshifts, while favoring the quintessence regime in the current epoch. In this context, we propose a new Gaussian-like form of EoS, termed BellDE, which avoids phantom behavior (\(w \geq -1\)) at higher redshifts while remaining precisely calibrated at lower redshifts. Interestingly, BellDE exhibits a transient phantom nature (\(w &lt; -1\)) around the transition redshift \(z \sim 0.5\), subsequently evolving into a quintessential regime (\(w &gt; -1\)). In particular, the BellDE model provides competitive statistical preference while offering greater flexibility in the redshift regime $z \sim 0.5-1$, where DE is observationally significant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpiderCat: A Catalog of Compact Binary Millisecond Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2505.11691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present SpiderCat, a multi-wavelength catalog of all publicly known compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the Galactic field.

SpiderCat includes both primary subclasses $-$ redbacks and black widows $-$ distinguished by companion mass, as well as candidates and peculiar systems such as transitional, huntsman and tidarren MSPs. As of this initial release, SpiderCat contains 111 entries: 30 redbacks, 50 black widows, two huntsmans, 23 redback candidates, five black widow candidates, and one huntsman candidate. In this paper, we compile and summarize key parameters for each system, including spin and orbital properties, and multiwavelength data from radio, optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray observations. An interactive, publicly accessible web interface, at this https URL , enables exploration and visualization of the data. The rapid growth of the number of known spiders, accelerated by the Fermi Large Area Telescope survey and its ability to identify MSPs in $\gamma$-rays, has opened the door to population-level studies. Utilizing SpiderCat, we analyze trends in spin period, orbital period, companion mass, emission properties, and spatial distribution.

Their implied mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming $\mathrm{ \sim 100 \ km\ s^{-1}}$ winds) from optical observations are generally in excess of values observed in realistic SN Ia progenitors. In this paper, we present an independent study of CSM densities around a sample of 29 archival Ia-CSM SNe using radio observations with the Very Large Array at 6 GHz. Motivated by the late ($\sim$2 yr) radio detection of the Ia-CSM SN 2020eyj, we observed old ($&gt;$1 yr) SNe where we are more likely to see the emergent synchrotron emission that may have been suppressed earlier by free-free absorption by the CSM. We do not detect radio emission down to 3$\sigma$ limits of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy in our sample. The only radio-detected candidate in our sample, SN 2022esa, was likely mis-classified as a Ia-CSM with early spectra, and appears more consistent with a peculiar Ic based on later-epochs. Assuming a wind-like CSM with temperatures between $2 \times 10^4$ K and $10^5$ K, and magnetic field-to-shock energy fraction ($\epsilon_B$) = $0.01-0.1$, the radio upper limits rule out mass-loss rates between $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (100 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$.

UHECRs heavier than helium are accelerated in the magnetized turbulent outflow outside the jets to a rigidity $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} \equiv E_{\rm cut}/eZ \approx 6-9$ EV, consistent with the measured value $\mathcal{R}_{\rm cut} = 6.3^{+6.3}_{-2.3}\,$EV from fitting data. This agreement strengthens the case that BNS mergers are the main site of UHECR production. The jets may accelerate protons and/or helium to cutoff energies $\approx 11.5$ and $\approx 35$ EeV, respectively. Such a jet component and its spallation products could explain the indication of a secondary light population at higher energy found in the analysis of \citet{muf19}. The relative abundances of different elements and the total energy in UHECRs per merger event will become calculable, pending advances in our understanding of the mechanism of ion uptake into the acceleration process and input from nuclear physics experiments. This scenario implies that each neutrino above 1 PeV is co-directional with a gravitational wave arriving $\approx 1$ day earlier, and that the highest energy UHECRs have masses heavier than iron.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI and fast radio burst used to constrain modified theories of gravity</a><span class="id">[2507.08056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper is devoted to the study of the viability of DESI and the fast radio burst to constrain the free parameters of modified theories of gravity.

Several factors may be responsible for the deformations, including strong magnetic fields, internal stresses, or local heating. The main effect produced by the deformations is the so-called free precession: the motion of the rotational axis with respect to the crust. We consider the evolution of a triaxially deformed isolated NS with a strong dipolar magnetic field for a broad range of parameters, taking into account the magnetic field decay. We show that the combination of pulsar torques and free precession results in a considerable broadening of the distribution of magnetic obliquity angles (the angle between the magnetic and rotational axes) and creates a population of objects where the rotational axis does not align with the magnetic axis at all but enters a limit-cycle regime. The combination of free precession and magnetic torques can also explain the observed distribution in pulsar braking indices by creating a periodic oscillation in the magnetic obliquity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-Dimensional Radiation-Hydrodynamic Simulations of Luminous Red Novae</a><span class="id">[2508.09257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are transients associated with mass ejection during stellar mergers and common envelope evolution (CEE).

Here, we perform two-dimensional moving-mesh radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of LRNe that take into account hydrogen and helium recombination and relevant opacities. We study a typical high-mass stellar merger, which dynamically ejects 2 $M_\odot$ with a characteristic velocity of 410 km/s. This ejecta collides with 2.7 $M_\odot$ of equatorially concentrated circumbinary material (CBM) left behind from a prior phase of non-conservative runaway mass transfer. We find that the resulting light curve is composed of a short, blue peak followed by a redder, predominantly shock-powered plateau with luminosities reaching up to $10^{41}$ erg/s and durations up to 200 days. These luminosities are significantly higher, and the durations much longer, than those produced by a simple spherical ejection of the same mass. They also depend in a complex way on the radial distribution of the CBM and the viewing angle. The shock is embedded in the ejecta and its observational signatures during the optically-thick phase are largely hidden. Our results are broadly compatible with observations of the brightest extragalactic LRNe and pave the way for the transformation of LRNe into powerful probes of binary evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Double-Peaked Optical Afterglow in GRB 110213A Inferring a Magnetized Thick Shell Ejecta</a><span class="id">[2508.13066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts early afterglows are important tracers for determining the radial structure and magnetization of the ejecta.

We adopt a semi-analytic model for the dynamics of forward and reverse shocks generated through an interaction between an arbitrary magnetized ejecta with a finite thickness and a stratified circumstellar medium. Multiwavelength radiation from forward and reverse shocks seen from an arbitrary viewing angle is calculated under a thin-shell approximation. Our analysis with multimodal nested sampling methods for GRB 110213A suggests that the thick shell ejecta naturally explains the shallow decay feature of the X-ray afterglow. The combination of the reverse shock emission in the strongly magnetized jet and forward shock emission in the weakly magnetized circumstellar medium makes the double peak feature of the optical afterglows. The estimated low radiative efficiency in the prompt phase may be a consequence of the high magnetization of the jet in this case.

We find tentative evidence ($\sim 3 \sigma$ significance) for a divergence in the relationship between the dispersion measure (DM) contributed by the intergalactic medium and redshift for FRBs whose signals intersect cosmic filaments compared to those that do not, suggesting excess baryons in the filamentary structures. Assuming an isothermal $\beta$-model gas profile with $\beta=2/3$, this discrepancy is best explained by a central baryon overdensity of $\delta_0 = 21^{+13}_{-12}$, broadly consistent with previous simulation and observational results. The inferred baryon fraction residing in filaments decreases with redshift, from approximately $0.25$-$0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.02$ to $0.15$-$0.30\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.5$, and $0.03$-$0.04\,\Omega_b$ at $z=0.8$. These estimates are likely lower bounds, particularly at $z&gt;0.5$, due to the limited number of identified filaments and localized FRBs at higher redshifts. We also examine various factors that may affect the statistical significance of our results. Our method offers an independent approach to tracing baryons in cosmic filaments and underscores the importance of expanding localized FRB samples and deepening galaxy surveys, i.e., key steps toward refining these estimates and addressing the missing baryon problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect at the core of CL J1226.9+3332 revealed by NOEMA</a><span class="id">[2509.14048]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present first detailed maps of the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect on a $z = 0.89$ cluster with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). The high sensitivity of these observations enabled the effective identification and removal of the millimetre-wave sources contaminating the tSZ signal, thus isolating the influence of the hot electron gas of the cluster on the cosmic microwave background radiation from other emissions. The tSZ observed with success by NOEMA was modelled together with previous single-dish observations (IRAM 30-metre, Green Bank Telescope, and Caltech Sub-millimeter Observatory) to obtain the first core-to-outskirts (from $\sim$ 15 to $\sim$ 1500 kpc) pressure profile reconstruction on such a high-redshift galaxy cluster. NOEMA observations with a high angular resolution have shown that the pressure profile is flat in the core of the cluster. These observations confirm the disturbed nature of CL J1226.9+3332 and map for the first time the distribution of its thermal gas at arcsecond scales in the environments of the central cluster galaxy. Our results showcase the excellent capabilities of NOEMA to complement and enhance the data provided by other millimetre-wave instruments in resolving the core of high-redshift clusters via tSZ emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transit Timing Variations in HIP 41378: CHEOPS and TESS confirm a non-transiting sixth planet in the system</a><span class="id">[2509.14156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In multiple-planet systems, gravitational interactions of exoplanets could lead to transit timing variations (TTVs), whose amplitude becomes significantly enhanced when planets are in or near mean-motion resonances (MMRs). In cases where both TTVs and radial velocity (RV) measurements are available, combined analysis can break degeneracies and provide robust planetary and system characterization, even detecting non-transiting planets. In this context, HIP 41378 hosts five confirmed transiting planets with periods ranging from 15 to over 542 days, providing a unique dynamical laboratory for investigating wide multi-planet systems analogous to the Solar System. In this study, we present an intensive space-based photometric follow-up of HIP 41378, combining 15 new CHEOPS observations with eight TESS sectors, alongside data from K2, Spitzer, HST, and HARPS. We dynamically modeled the TTVs and RV signals of the two inner sub-Neptunes via N-body integration. These planets, HIP 41378 b ($P_{b}$ = 15.57 days) and HIP 41378 c ($P_{c}$ = 31.71 days), are close to ($\Delta\sim1.8$ %) a 2:1 period commensurability. We report a clear detection of TTVs with amplitudes of 20 mins for planet b and greater than 3 hrs for planet c. We dynamically confirm the planetary nature of HIP 41378 g, a non-transiting planet with a period of about 64 days and a mass of about 7 $M_{\oplus}$, close to a 2:1 commensurability with planet c, suggesting a possible MMR chain in the inner system. Our precise determination of the masses, eccentricities, and radii of HIP 41378 b and c enabled us to investigate their possible volatile-rich compositions. Finally, by leveraging on the last TESS sectors we constrained the period of HIP 41378 d to three possible aliases ($P_{d} =$ 278, 371, and 1113 days) suggesting that the system could be placed in a double quasi resonant chain, highlighting its complex dynamical architecture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetar-like flares behind the high-energy emission in LS 5039</a><span class="id">[2509.19173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LS 5039 hosts a high-mass star, and a compact object that might be a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS). This scenario requires a mechanism to power its persistent and strong nonthermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which the nonsteady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can regularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling the source nonthermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can recurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose growth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To illustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction structure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along the orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS relevant for the nonthermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches the magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind structure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection. However, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the termination shock propagates back toward the magnetosphere, resuming the process. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows, intensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure produced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a quasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS magnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough to explain the nonthermal emission of LS 5039. A magnetospheric multipolar magnetic field much stronger than the dipolar one may provide the required energetics, and help to explain the lack of evidence of a recent supernova remnant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instabilities at recollimation shocks in MHD jets</a><span class="id">[2510.01742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AGN jet structure and stability remain uncertain; recollimation shocks are linked to morphology and variability, but the role of downstream instabilities is still unclear. We aim to investigate how jet magnetization and other physical parameters influence the development of instabilities beyond the first recollimation shock. In particular, we focus on identifying the conditions under which the centrifugal instability (CFI) is effective. We perform high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations using the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO. The jets are initialized with a conical geometry and propagate into an ambient medium, and we follow by axisymmetric simulations how they evolve towards a steady-state. In 2D we explore a range of magnetizations (from 0 to 1), pressure contrasts, and inertia ratios to characterize the formation and evolution of recollimation shocks. The results are further evaluated using linear stability analysis to assess the growth and suppression of CFI. Finally, we perform 3D simulations of unstable and stable jets. We discuss how the different parameters of the axisymmetric steady solutions influence the location and strength of recollimation. We find that, even in moderately magnetized jets, $\sigma$=0.1, the CFI can still develop under suitable local conditions and disrupt the jet structure. This instability is governed by the jet radius, curvature, Lorentz factor, and magnetization, and is not always predictable from injection conditions. While magnetization can delay or locally suppress instability growth, it does not guarantee long-term jet stability. Our 3D results highlight the limitations of 2D models in capturing non-axisymmetric and nonlinear effects, and underline the complex interplay between magnetic confinement and destabilizing mechanisms. These findings have implications for interpreting variability, and polarization structure in AGN jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond CPL: Evidence for dynamical dark energy in three-parameter models</a><span class="id">[2510.03779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce two three-parameter extensions of the minimal Akhtar-Hossain (mAH) dark energy parametrization, termed modified minimal AH (MmAH1 and MmAH2), which provide a smooth and bounded evolution of the dark energy equation of state while retaining $\Lambda$CDM as a limiting case. Using a joint analysis of the CMB compressed likelihood, DESI DR2 BAO, $H(z)$, redshift space distortions, and three SNeIa samples (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DESY5), we compare these models with $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, mAH, CPL, and the three-parameter CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ extension. The standard cosmological parameters remain stable across all models, while CPL, MmAH1 and MmAH2 parametrizations yield modest but consistent improvements in fit ($\Delta\chi^2\simeq-6$ to $-12$ for PantheonPlus and Union3, and $\simeq-38$ for DESY5). Statistical consistency with $\Lambda$CDM, quantified via the Mahalanobis distance in one, two, and three dimensional parameter subspaces, reveals mild to moderate deviations, $\sim2$–$2.5\sigma$ for $+$PantheonPlus, $2$–$3\sigma$ for $+$Union3, and up to $4$–$5\sigma$ for $+$DESY5 combination, depending on model complexity.

However, distant and long-period OC Cepheids remain limited, while the confirmed samples still require more precise determinations of their physical properties, such as ages and extinctions. In this work, we present a comprehensive census of OC Cepheids based on an extensive sample of distant OCs from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). By combining astrometric and photometric membership analyses, we identified 110 CCs associated with 102 OCs, of which 41 CCs across 37 OCs were classified as OC Cepheids, while the remaining cases were considered candidate or rejected associations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, while 4 of the 41 OC Cepheids are newly reported here. Using updated cluster parameters derived from manual isochrone fitting, we primarily refined the PAR to log Age = (-0.595 $\pm$ 0.044) log P + (8.430 $\pm$ 0.042) and recalibrated the PWR to WG = (-3.615 $\pm$ 0.083) log P + (-2.379 $\pm$ 0.096). This study expands the sample of confirmed and candidate OC Cepheids. The newly longest-period confirmed OC Cepheid is BM Per (CWNU 3123) with log P = 1.36, and two newly discovered OC Cepheid candidates have distances exceeding 6 kpc.

Here, we compile a homogeneous library of all exoplanet and brown dwarf K-band spectra observed by GRAVITY thus far. We re-reduced all the available GRAVITY dual-field high-contrast data and, where companions are detected, extract their  2.0-2.4 $\mu$m K-band contrast spectra. We then derived stellar model atmospheres for all employed flux references, which we used to convert the companion contrast into companion flux spectra. Solely from the resulting GRAVITY spectra, we extracted spectral types, spectral indices, and bulk physical properties for all companions. Finally, and with the help of age constraints from the literature, we also derived isochronal masses for most companions using evolutionary models. The resulting library contains R   500 GRAVITY spectra of 39 substellar companions from late M to late T spectral types, including the entire L-T transition. Throughout this transition, a shift from CO-dominated late M- and L-type dwarfs to CH4-dominated T-type dwarfs can be observed in the K-band. The GRAVITY spectra alone constrain the objects' bolometric luminosity to typically within $\pm$0.15 dex. The derived isochronal masses agree with dynamical masses from the literature where available, except for HD 4113 c for which we confirm its previously reported potential underluminosity. Medium-resolution spectroscopy of substellar companions with GRAVITY provides insight into the carbon chemistry and the cloudiness of these objects' atmospheres. It also constrains these objects' bolometric luminosities which can yield measurements of their formation entropy if combined with dynamical masses, for instance from Gaia and GRAVITY astrometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">N-body Simulations of cosmologies with Light Massive Relics</a><span class="id">[2510.18797]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$.

Understanding these effects will be crucial to pin down the underlying particle physics properties of any future $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ detection. While their impact has been well-studied on linear scales, this work develops the framework for and presents results from the first set of cosmological N-body simulations that can track the effects of LiMRs, as a function of their mass and temperature, down to fully nonlinear scales. Importantly, our simulations model the impact of both the massive Standard Model neutrinos and LiMRs, which will be crucial in disentangling possible degeneracies. We systematically explore the effects of LiMR properties such as mass, temperature, and initial distribution, on various cosmological observables, including the total matter power spectrum, Halo Mass Functions (HMF), Mass-Concentration relation, radial halo profiles, and weak lensing signals around massive clusters.

Since an $X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20628" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Field-Line Curvature and Its Role in Particle Acceleration by Magnetically Dominated Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2510.20628]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We employ first-principles, fully kinetic particle-in-cell simulations to investigate magnetic field-line curvature in magnetically dominated turbulent plasmas and its role in particle acceleration through curvature-drift motion along the motional electric field. By varying the fluctuation-to-mean magnetic-field ratio $\delta B_0/B_0$, we examine curvature $\kappa$ statistics and their connection to particle acceleration. The curvature probability densities display broad power-law wings, scaling linearly in $\kappa$ below the peak and developing hard high-$\kappa$ tails for $\delta B_0/B_0 \gtrsim 1$. As the mean field strengthens, the high-$\kappa$ tails steepen, and large-curvature events are suppressed when $\delta B_0/B_0 \ll 1$. The probability density functions of magnetic field-line contraction, ${\bf v}_E \cdot {\bf \kappa}$, with ${\bf v}_E$ the field-line velocity, develop power-law tails well described by a symmetric Pareto distribution, characteristic of stochastic energy exchanges, with the tails becoming harder as $\delta B_0/B_0$ increases. Our guiding-center analysis shows that curvature-drift acceleration accounts for a substantial fraction of the energization via the motional electric field, and that it strengthens with increasing $\delta B_0/B_0$. For well-magnetized particles, curvature-drift acceleration typically exceeds ${\bf\nabla}B$ drift, polarization drift, and betatron contributions. These results identify curvature-drift acceleration as a principal pathway through which magnetized turbulence transfers energy to nonthermal particles in astrophysical plasmas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">110.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN2017ckj: A linearly declining Type IIb supernova with a relatively massive hydrogen envelope</a><span class="id">[2510.22989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical observations of the Type IIb supernova (SN) 2017ckj, covering approximately 180 days after the explosion.

The $V$-band light curve exhibits a short rise time of about 5 days and reaches an absolute fitted peak magnitude of $M_{\rm V}=-18.49\pm0.18\mathrm{mag}$. The late-time multi-band light curves reveal a linear decline. We modelled the bolometric light curve of SN2017ckj to constrain the progenitor and the explosion parameters. We estimated a total mass of $\rm ^{56}Ni$ synthesized by SN2017ckj of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.21^{+0.05}_{-0.03}\ M_\odot$, with a massive H-rich envelope of $M_{\rm env} = 0.4^{+0.1}_{-0.1}\ M_\odot$. Both the $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass and the envelope mass of SN2017ckj are higher than those of typical SNe IIb, in agreement with its peculiar light curve evolution. The early-time spectra of SN2017ckj are dominated by a blue continuum, accompanied by narrow $\rm H_\alpha$ and \Heii emission lines. The earliest spectrum exhibits flash ionization features, from which we estimated a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\sim 3\times10^{-4}M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. At later epochs, the spectra develop broad P-Cygni profiles and become increasingly similar to those of SNe IIb, especially SN2018gk. The late-time spectrum at around 139 days does not show a distinct decline in the strength of $\rm H_\alpha$ emission profile, also indicating a relatively massive envelope of its progenitor. Aside from the $\rm H_\alpha$ feature, the nebular spectrum exhibits prominent emission lines of \Oi, \Caii, [\Caii], and \Mgi], which are consistent with the prototypical SN1993J.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">111.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24089" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Evidence for a Dynamically Evolving Dark Energy Scenario: Tomographic Alcock-Paczyński Test with Redshift-Space Correlation Function II</a><span class="id">[2510.24089]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We apply an extended Alcock-Paczyński (AP) test to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy models with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state.

We consider dark matter coupled to a dark photon that mixes with the photon and dark matter coupled to photons through an electric or magnetic dipole moment. We discuss contributions to the freeze-in production of such dark matter particles from standard model fermion-antifermion annihilation and plasmon decay. We also derive constraints on such dark matter from the cooling of red giant stars and horizontal branch stars, carefully evaluating the thermal processes as well as the bremsstrahlung process that dominates for masses above the plasma frequency. We find that the parameters needed to obtain the observed relic abundance from freeze-in are excluded below a few tens of keV, depending on the value of the dark gauge coupling constant for the dark photon portal model, and below a few keV, depending on the reheating temperature for dark matter with an electric or magnetic dipole moment. While laboratory probes are unlikely to probe these freeze-in scenarios in general, we show that for dark matter with an electric or magnetic dipole moment and for dark matter masses above the reheating temperature, the couplings needed for freeze-in to produce the observed relic abundance can be probed partially by upcoming direct-detection experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">114.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of hyperons on structural properties of neutron stars and hybrid stars within the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</a><span class="id">[2412.03348]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of hyperons and phase transition to quark matter on the structural properties of neutron stars within the regularized four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity (4DEGB).

The presence of hyperons softens the EoS and with a phase transition, the EoS further softens, and the speed of sound squared drops to around 0.2 for the maximum mass configuration, which lies in the pure quark phase. Adjusting the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant, $\alpha$, within its allowed range results in a decrease in the mass-radius relationship for negative $\alpha$, and an increase for positive $\alpha$. In addition, functions are fitted to the maximum mass and its associated radius as a function of the constant $\alpha$ to observe its impact on these properties. We find that positive values of $\alpha$ support massive stars consistent with the 2 $M_{\odot}$ constraint and NICER measurements, while negative values, although compatible with low-mass radius observations, fail to reach the observed maximum mass, particularly for EoSs involving phase transitions.

For an arbitrary moving observer, we covariantly define the phonon's energy, relative phase velocity, effective refraction index and mass tensor. We point out that true instabilities (ghosts, gradient) are observer independent, being identified by the acoustic metric's signature and determinant. However, apparent instabilities, such as complex phonon energies, can stem from an ill-posed Cauchy problem in certain observer frames. Negative phonon energies appear for supersonic observers, not signaling true instabilities, but leading to Cherenkov radiation. We extend this local picture to a global foliation, deriving the condition for a spatial slice to be a Cauchy surface for a well-posed initial value problem. This Hamiltonian is bounded if the foliation's comoving observer is subsonic. Otherwise, for a Killing vector timelike in both metrics, an alternative conserved charge that bounds motion exists. The action for perturbations yields an acoustically conserved asymmetric energy-momentum tensor (EMT), not conserved in the usual spacetime. Yet, with a timelike acoustic Killing vector, this EMT forms a current conserved in both the acoustic and usual spacetimes, with the acoustic Hamiltonian functional as its conserved charge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">118.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-wave memory effects in the Damour-Esposito-Farèse extension of Brans-Dicke theory</a><span class="id">[2501.07488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave memory effects are lasting changes in the strain and its time integrals. They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Farèse extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Farèse theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories. Nevertheless, our results can be used to analyze and interpret memory effects from numerical-relativity simulations of binaries in this theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">119.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interference patterns for simple lens models in wave-optics regime</a><span class="id">[2502.11488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work studies interference patterns created by simple lens models (point mass, Chang-Refsdal, and binary lens) in the wave optics regime, primarily in the context of lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) in the LIGO band at frequencies around 100 Hz. We study how the interference patterns behave close to the caustic curves which mark the high magnification regions in conventional geometric optics. In addition, we also look at the formation of highly de-amplified regions in the amplification maps close to caustics and how they differ under wave and geometric optics. We see that for a source close to caustics, the oscillations in the amplification factor (their amplitude and location of crests and troughs) can differ significantly in wave optics compared to geometric optics. As we move away from caustics, the wave optics amplification factor starts to converge towards geometric optics one, especially the frequencies at which crests and through occur in the amplification factor, although the amplitude of these oscillations can still be considerably different. For Chang-Refsdal and binary lens with ${\sim}100\:{\rm M_\odot}-200\:{\rm M_\odot}$ can introduce significant de-amplification at frequencies ${\sim}100$ Hz when the source is close to caustics, which may help us distinguish such lenses from the point mass lens.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Higgs Inflation with Vector-Like Quark Stabilisation and the ACT spectral index</a><span class="id">[2505.07488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034$. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$, which is 2.74$\sigma$ below the ACT mean value. We show that when an otherwise metastable Standard Model Higgs Inflation potential is stabilised by the addition of vector-like quark pairs and the potential is renormalised in the Jordan frame, the value of $n_s$ is generally larger than 0.965 and can explain the ACT observation. As an example, assuming the 2022 PDG direct measurement central value for the t quark mass, $m_{t} = 172.69$ GeV, and central values for the SM inputs to the renormalisation group equations, we obtain $n_s = 0.9792 - 0.9844$ for the case of three isosinglet vector-like B quarks with mass $m_{Q}$ in the range 1-3 TeV, with the lowest value of the $n_s$ range being 1.44$\sigma$ above the ACT mean value. The model predicts primordial gravitational wave with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.87 \times 10^{-3} - 1.21 \times 10^{-2}$ for $m_{Q} =$ 1-3 TeV, which will be easily observable in forthcoming CMB experiments. Observation of vector-like quarks of mass close to 1 TeV mass combined with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 0.01$ would support the model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">121.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00242" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</a><span class="id">[2507.00242]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">122.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transition to Petschek Reconnection in Subrelativistic Pair Plasmas: Implications for Particle Acceleration</a><span class="id">[2508.08533]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasmas has emerged in recent years as a candidate for the origin of radiation from extreme astrophysical environments, the corresponding subrelativistic pair plasma regime has remained less explored, leaving open the question of how relativistic physics affects reconnection. In this paper, we investigate the differences between these regimes by contrasting 2D particle-in-cell simulations of reconnection in pair plasmas with relativistic magnetization ($\sigma \gg 1$) and subrelativistic magnetization ($\sigma &lt; 1$). By utilizing unprecedentedly large domain sizes and outflow boundary conditions, we demonstrate that lowering the magnetization results in a change in the reconnection geometry from a plasmoid chain to a Petschek geometry, where laminar exhausts bounded by slow-mode shocks emanate from a single diffusion region. We attribute this change to the reduced plasmoid production rate in the low-$\sigma$ case: when the secondary tearing rate is sufficiently low, plasmoids are too few in number to prevent the system from relaxing into a stable Petschek configuration. This geometric change also affects particle energization: we show that while high-$\sigma$ plasmoid chains generate power-law energy spectra, low-$\sigma$ Petschek exhausts merely heat incoming plasma and yield negligible nonthermal acceleration. These results have implications for predicting the global current sheet geometry and the resulting energy spectrum in a variety of systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">123.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflation in $F(R)$ gravity models revisited after ACT</a><span class="id">[2508.08927]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $F(R)$ gravity models of inflation are revisited in light of the recent observations of cosmic microwave background radiation by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and DESI Collaboration. A detailed study of the evolution equations in the Jordan frame is given and a new description of the slow-roll approximation in the $F(R)$-gravity-based models of inflation is proposed. It is found that all those models of inflation are significantly constrained by demanding a higher (than the Planck Telescope value) cosmological tilt $n_s$ of scalar perturbations and a positive running index $\alpha_s$ favored by ACT. It is not difficult to meet the ACT constraints on the scalar tilt $n_s$ by modifying the existing models of inflation, but simultaneously demanding a positive running $\alpha_s$ would rule out many of them. Using the proposed slow-roll approximation in the Jordan frame, we provide a new modification of the Starobinsky inflation model in the framework of $F(R)$ gravity, which satisfies all ACT constraints. An extension of our ACT-consistent inflation model to the unified $F(R)$-gravity description of Starobinsky-like inflation and production of primordial black holes on a smaller scale is also proposed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">124.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New ab initio constrained extended Skyrme equations of state for simulations of neutron stars, supernovae and binary mergers: II. Thermal response in the suprasaturation density domain</a><span class="id">[2509.23910]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae, mergers of binary neutron stars and formation of stellar black holes, which employed standard Skyrme interactions, established clear correlations between the evolution of these processes, characteristics of the hot compact objects, as well as neutrino and gravitational wave signals, and the value of effective nucleon mass at the saturation density. Unfortunately, the density dependence of the effective mass of nucleons in these models does not align with the predictions of ab initio models with three body forces. In this work, we investigate the thermal response for a set of extended Skyrme interactions that feature widely different density dependencies of the effective mass of the nucleons. Thermal contributions to the energy density and pressure are studied along with a few thermal coefficients over wide domains of density, temperature and isospin asymmetry, relevant for the physics of hot compact objects. For some of the effective interactions, the thermal pressure is negative at high densities. This results in a situation where hot compact stars can support less mass before collapsing into a black hole compared to their cold counterparts. Moreover, the higher the temperature, the lower the maximum mass that the hot star can support.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">125.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal and Magnetic effects on Bulk Viscosity in Binary Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.09104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star mergers, proto-neutron stars and core-collapse supernovae involve finite temperatures and strong magnetic fields. Previous studies on the effect of magnetic fields on flavor-equilibration processes relied on the Fermi surface approximation, which is not a reliable approximation in the neutrino-transparent regime of matter in supernovae or neutron star mergers. In a recent study, we went beyond the Fermi surface approximation, performing the full phase space integral to obtain direct Urca rates in a background magnetic field. In this work, we extend these calculations to incorporate the collisional broadening (“modified Urca”) contribution. We use the recently developed Nucleon Width Approximation, which naturally includes the magnetic field dependence of all contributions. We demonstrate the impact of magnetic fields on the flavor-equilibrium condition for two finite-temperature equations of state with different direct Urca thresholds. We also study the impact of magnetic fields on the bulk viscous dissipation of density oscillations relevant in postmerger scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">126.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the Swift Memory Burden Effect with GW250114-like Events</a><span class="id">[2510.19916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black hole spectroscopy allows to infer the properties of the remnant of a binary black hole coalescence. Motivated by the recent proposal that a black hole's information load can alter its classical response to small perturbations, an effect known as the swift memory burden, we develop a minimal phenomenological framework to analyze the ringdown of a binary black hole merger and confront it with the data from the GW250114 event. We perform a Bayesian analysis combining the frequencies of the (220) and (440) quasi-normal modes and obtain a lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 2$, where $p$ controls how the gaps reopen when the black hole's master mode occupation departs from the critical value. Moreover, using a Fisher information matrix (high signal-to-noise ratio) approximation, we forecast the lower bound $\log_{10}p \gtrsim 3$ for a GW250114-like event observed with Cosmic Explorer or Einstein Telescope. Our results disfavour rapid gap reopening, shedding light on how the swift memory burden effect can be probed with current and next-generation detectors.</p></div></details></article></body>
