Their nature remains uncertain with hypotheses including exotic phenomena. We assemble a sample of LRD-like objects at $z&gt;3$ and use self-consistent radiative-transfer calculations to show that a supermassive black hole accreting from a dense gas cocoon accurately reproduces the detailed spectra. We show that the cocoons must be non-spherical, with comparable amounts of inflowing and outflowing material. And we predict correlations between Balmer break strength, Balmer line-absorption and scattering line width, which we confirm in our observed sample. We reproduce all LRD-like properties without requiring star-like atmospheres and we determine the typical black hole in our sample to be of order a million solar masses, with ionized cocoon masses of tens of solar masses potentially supplied from a much larger cold-gas reservoir.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A nuclear disc at Cosmic Noon: evidence of early bar-driven galaxy evolution</a><span class="id">[2601.18871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies have revealed that bars can form as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang, already displaying similar characteristics of evolved bars in the Local Universe. Bars redistribute angular momentum across the galaxy, regulating star formation, AGN activity, and building new stellar structures such as nuclear discs. However, the effects of bar-driven evolution on young galaxies are not yet known, as no evidence of bar-built stellar structures has ever been found beyond $z = 1$, until now. In this work, we show evidence of a bar-built, star-forming nuclear disc, already present at redshift $z = 1.5$. This is the first evidence of a bar-built stellar structure at Cosmic Noon. We find that this nuclear disc is actively forming stars and has the same size as some nuclear discs in nearby galaxies. This evidence solidifies the now emerging picture in which bars are fundamental not only in the late evolution of galaxies, but also in their early evolutionary stages. It changes the current paradigm by urging a revision of our picture of galaxy evolution beyond redshift one, to include new considerations on the role played by bars as early as a few billion years after the Big Bang.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18876" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Milky Way's circular velocity curve measured using element abundance gradients</a><span class="id">[2601.18876]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic surveys now supply precise stellar label measurements such as element abundances for large samples of stars throughout the Milky Way. These element abundances are known to correlate with orbital actions or other dynamical invariants. We present a new data-driven method for empirically measuring the circular velocity curve of the Galaxy that uses element abundance gradients in the plane of radial kinematics. We use stellar surface abundances from the $\textit{APOGEE}$ survey combined with kinematic data from the $\textit{Gaia}$ mission. Our results confirm the ordered structure of the Milky Way disk in terms of average [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] abundance ratios, and suggest that $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ traces the radial position of stars in the disk, while $\langle$[Mg/Fe]$\rangle$ traces the orbital excursions around this radius. Our method uses the radial orbit structure in the Galaxy to enable an empirical measurement of the circular velocity curve, epicyclic and azimuthal frequencies, and kinematic gradients across the Milky Way disk. From these measurements, we infer a value of the circular velocity curve at the Solar radius of $v_{c,\odot} = 235.3^{+2.8}_{-3.7}$ km s$^{-1}$ using the most constraining abundance ratio, [Mg/Fe]. We also measure the radial and azimuthal frequencies for a circular orbit at the solar radius, $\kappa_{0,R_\odot}=36.9^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $\Omega_{0,R_\odot}=28.5_{-0.1}^{+0.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$, respectively. These values lead to an estimate of the Oort constants of $A = 16.5^{+0.1}_{-0.1}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$ and $B=-11.9^{+0.1}_{-0.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. We measure the radial acceleration at the Solar radius to be $(\frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial R})_{\odot} = a_{R_\odot}=7.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ pc Myr$^{-2}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homogenous abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti for about 1500 red giants in 16 globular clusters from FLAMES spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.18878]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The FLAMES survey “Na-O anti-correlation and HB&quot; uncovered the modern standard for globular clusters (GCs), that is their ubiquitous multiple stellar populations (MPs) distinct by the abundance of proton-capture elements. That survey can still be mined to extract a wealth of data. We derive new abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti for 948, 954, 1542, and 1350 red giant branch stars in 16 GCs, both formed in situ or accreted in the Milky Way. The program GCs cover the metallicity range from [Fe/H]=-2.35 dex to [Fe/H]=-0.74 dex. Both the halo and disc GCs show a clear overabundance of alpha-elements with the modulation in Mg and Si due to the MPs phenomenon in different clusters. We found star to star variations in Si abundance correlated to changes in Na in more than half of our sample, implying that temperatures in excess of about 65 MK were achieved in the polluters responsible for the enrichment. We confirm with an enlarged sample the previous result that significant variations in Mg are observed in GCs that are metal-poor, massive or both. Evidence of excess of Ca with respect to reference unpolluted field stars are found in NGC 6752 and NGC 7078, indicating the action of proton-capture reactions at very high temperature regime in these GCs. These excesses fit very well in a previously found relation as a function of a combination of cluster mass and metallicity shown by other typical signatures of MPs. At odds with previous results based on the Si abundance from APOGEE, we found that the average abundance of alpha-elements is not an efficient discriminating factor between in situ and accreted GCs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical and Chemical Characterization of GY 91's Multi-ringed Protostellar Disk with ALMA</a><span class="id">[2601.18884]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GY 91, commonly categorized as a Class I young stellar object, is notable for disk dust substructures that have been hypothesized to trace early planet formation. Using the ALMA 12-m and ACA arrays, we present new Band 7 dust continuum and molecular line observations of GY 91 at an angular resolution of ( 40 au). We report detections of CS $J=6-5$, N$_2$H$^+$ $J=3-2$, C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$, H$_2$CS $J_{K_a, K_c} = 8_{1,7}-7_{1,6}$, H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$, and H$_2$CO $J_{K_a, K_c} = 4_{2,3}-3_{2,2}$, as well as a tentative detection of $^{13}$C$^{18}$O $J=3-2$. We observe azimuthal asymmetry in CS and H$_2$CS emission, as well as radially structured H$_2$CO $4_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ emission outside the dust continuum. C$^{18}$O and H$_2$CO 4$_{0,4}-3_{0,3}$ show significant cloud contamination, while CS and N$_2$H$^+$ are good tracers of Keplerian rotation originating from the disk. Envelope emission does not appear to contribute significantly either to the continuum or molecular line observations. GY 91's chemical properties appear in large part to resemble those of Class II disks, although observations of additional molecular probes should be obtained for a fuller comparison. With CS, we estimated a dynamical stellar mass of 0.58 $M_\odot$, which is higher than previous estimates from stellar evolutionary models (0.25 $M_\odot$). Using both radiative transfer modeling of the dust continuum and comparison of the C$^{18}$O and N$_2$H$^+$ fluxes to literature thermochemical models, we estimate a disk mass of $\sim0.01$ $M_\odot$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Homogeneous abundance ratios of hydrostatic and explosive alpha-elements in globular clusters from high resolution optical spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2601.18885]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic globular clusters (GCs) were born shortly after the Big Bang. For such old stellar systems the initial mass function (IMF) at the high mass regime can never be observed directly, because stars more massive than about 1 Mo have evolved since longtime. However, the hydrostatic to explosive alpha-element ratio (HEx ratio) offers a way to bypass the lack of observable high mass stars through the yields that massive stars released when exploding as supernovae, incorporated in the stars we presently observe in GCs. The HEx ratio measures the percentage of high mass stars over the total number of stars exploding as supernovae and it is an efficient probe of the ephemeral first phases of the GC evolution. We exploited a recently completed survey to assemble a dataset of very homogeneous abundances of alpha-elements in 27 GCs from [Fe/H]  -2.4 to   -0.3 dex. In agreement with previous results from APOGEE, we confirm that the HEx ratio is indistinguishable for GCs formed in situ and accreted in the Galaxy, and that this ratio decreases with increasing metallicity. However, we posit that this trend is better explained by a metallicity-dependent IMF deficient in the highest mass stars at high metallicity, as corroborated by the declining [O/Mg] ratio as a function of the [Mg/H] ratio. At odds with the previous analysis based on APOGEE data, we detect an anti-correlation of HEx ratio with both present day and initial GC masses. Finally, we hypothesise that in that analysis, the stars of the GC M 54 were probably confused with stars in the core of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, where the cluster is presently immersed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the inference of kinematics from mock JWST NIRSpec/MSA observations of TNG50 galaxies at $z\sim2-6$</a><span class="id">[2601.18890]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the TNG50 galaxy formation simulation to generate mock JWST NIRCam and NIRSpec microshutter array (MSA) observations of H$\alpha$-emitting gas in $M_*=10^8-10^{11.5}\,M_\odot$ star-forming galaxies at $z=2-6$. We measure morphological properties from the mock imaging through Sersic profile fitting, and gas rotational velocities ($v$) and velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) by fitting the mock spectra as thin, rotating discs. To test the efficacy of such simple parametric models in describing complex ionised gas kinematics, we compare the best-fit quantities to intrinsic simulation measurements. At $z=3$, we find that $v$ and $\sigma$ for aligned and resolved sources generally agree well with intrinsic measurements, within a factor of $\sim$2 and $\sim$1.5, respectively. The recovery of kinematics is robust for smooth, disc-like systems, but $v$ and $\sigma$ can be over- or underestimated by more than a factor of 2, respectively, for intrinsically elongated systems. The scatter in the recovery accuracy is larger at higher redshift, as TNG50 galaxies at $z&gt;3$ deviate more strongly from the thin rotating disc assumption. Despite uncertain measurements for individual galaxies, we find that key population trends, such as the weak redshift evolution of $\sigma$ and $v/\sigma$ as well as the dependence of $\sigma$ on the global star formation rate, are broadly recovered by our kinematic modelling. Our work provides the end-to-end framework needed to compare NIRSpec MSA observations to cosmological simulations and to quantify observational biases in measuring ionised gas kinematics, highlighting the need for the development of dedicated models for high-redshift galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubble Study of the Proper Motion of HST-1 in the Jet of M87</a><span class="id">[2601.18893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The radio galaxy M87 is well known for its jet, which features a series of bright knots observable from radio to X-ray wavelengths. The most famous of these, HST-1, exhibits superluminal motion, and our analysis of {\it Chandra} data \citep{Thimmappa24} reveals a correlation between the X-ray flux of HST-1 and its separation from the core. This correlation likely arises from moving shocks in the jet, allowing measurement of the internal structure of HST-1 in the X-ray band. To follow up on these results, we use observations from the {\it Hubble} Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys HRC/WFC/SBC channel and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3)'s UVIS to analyze the image and flux variability of HST-1. Our analysis includes 245 ACS and 120 WFC3 observations from 2002-2022, with a total exposure time of $\sim345$ ks. We study the brightness profile of the optical jet and measure the relative separation between the core and HST-1 for comparison to the X-ray. We find that the X-ray and the UV/optical emission could arise from physically distinct regions. The measured proper motion of the knot HST-1 is 1.04$\pm$0.04 c from 2002-2005 and around 2.1$\pm$0.05 c from 2005-2022. We discuss the acceleration of the jet and the flaring synchrotron emission from HST-1 from optical to X-rays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proof that the Milky Way experienced a significant merger only 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang</a><span class="id">[2601.18896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The merger history of the Galaxy has been traced back firmly to redshift 2 (10 Billion years ago). While there have been claims of the existence of at least one more significant merger before this time, supporting evidence has been indirect and contentious. Here we show that the population of globular clusters around the Galaxy depicts three distinct age-metallicity sequences, one associated with the merger with Gaia-Enceladus 10 billion years ago, one to the progenitor of the Milky Way and a third intermediate sequence associated to at least one merger which we estimate took place merely 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang. This discovery has been possible thanks to exquisite Hubble Space Telescope data and sophisticated analysis that enables very precise relative age determination of globular clusters. The newly identified sequence reveals that this merger took place with an object of stellar mass similar to that of Gaia-Enceladus ( 5x10$^8$ M$_{\odot}$), and which deposited most of its mass in the inner 6 kpc of the Milky Way. The unambiguous identification of a third merger event in the inner Galaxy puts to rest earlier debates, and honoring previous work we name the progenitor system Low-energy-Kraken-Heracles, or LKH for short.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiwavelength Analysis of Six Luminous, Fast Blue Optical Transients</a><span class="id">[2601.18926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present multiwavelength observations and analysis of six luminous fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) discovered in Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey data. We identified these LFBOTs from their fast light-curve evolution ($t_{1/2}\leq 12 $d), blue colors at peak brightness ($g-r\leq-0.5 $mag), a visible host galaxy, high optical luminosity ($M_g&lt;-20$), and an X-ray or radio detection. With the exception of AT2024aehp (ZTF24abygbss), these transients exhibit peaks in their $10\,$GHz radio light curves at $t_{\text{rest}} \approx 50-100$ d, with peak radio luminosities ranging from $10^{38}-10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Modeling the radio emission as synchrotron radiation indicates a fast ($v=0.1-0.3c$) shock in a dense ($n_e\approx10^{3}-10^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$) medium. The X-ray emission varies by $\approx2$ orders of magnitude in luminosity ($10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) at $t_{\text{rest}}\sim20 $d. Analysis of the host-galaxy photometry and spectroscopy for each transient shows that they are predominantly nonnuclear (a few kpc offset) with star-forming host galaxies of stellar masses $10^{9}-10^{11} ,M_\odot$. Unlike all other LFBOTs to date, AT2024aehp exhibited a luminous ($M&lt;-19 $mag) plateau in the optical light curve; spectra during this plateau phase showed a featureless blue continuum. The $6-15$ GHz radio emission of AT2024aehp brightened by over an order of magnitude from $t_{\text{rest}} \approx70 $d to $t_{\mathrm{rest}} \approx130 $d. The mostly consistent radio behavior between optically selected LFBOTs implies a similar circumburst medium, leading us to prefer a progenitor scenario in which mass is lost in a consistent way shortly prior to the terminal event, such as a massive star merging with a compact object.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Predictions of the Accreted Stellar Halos around Milky Way-Like Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.18954]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, stellar halos form through the accretion and disruption of satellite galaxies. We introduce new semi-analytic modeling within the SatGen framework to track the ex-situ stellar components of Milky Way–like galaxies across large ensembles of merger trees, enabling a statistical study of the stochastic nature of galaxy assembly. We find that accreted stellar halos are typically built by only a few progenitors and are highly sensitive to the fate of the most massive satellite, producing order-of-magnitude variations in accreted stellar halo mass even at fixed host halo mass. Different stellar components trace distinct phases of host halo growth: central and accreted stellar mass correlate most strongly with early assembly, while surviving satellites trace more recent accretion. Finally, using Random Forest Regression, we quantify how well observable galaxy properties can recover halo assembly histories, providing a framework for interpreting upcoming low-surface-brightness observations of stellar halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High resolution observations of 'dark' neutral hydrogen clouds in the Virgo cluster with the Very Large Array</a><span class="id">[2601.19011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have observed six `dark' neutral hydrogen (HI) clouds discovered in the Virgo cluster by the Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), giving higher angular and velocity resolution than the original AGES observations. We detected compact HI emission in two of the sources, AGESVC1 231 and AGESVC1 274, allowing us to firmly associate them with faint ($m_g &gt; 18.5$), blue ($g-i &lt; 0.1$) optical counterparts with high $M_{HI}/L_g$ ratios. In a further two sources, we detected low column-density extended HI emission, consistent with these being dispersing clouds from ram-pressure stripping or tidal interactions. The final two sources were not detected with the VLA, allowing us to set low column-density limits on the HI detected by AGES that are consistent with these clouds also being formed from HI that is dispersing into the intra-cluster medium. The four HI sources not associated with optical counterparts thus appear likely to be relatively short-lived objects. No evidence was found for either pressure-supported turbulent spheres or stable dark galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ERGO-ML: The assembly histories of HSC galaxy images via invertible neural networks, contrastive learning, and cosmological simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.19148]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper of ERGO-ML (Extracting Reality from Galaxy Observables with Machine Learning), we develop a model that infers the merger/assembly histories of galaxies directly from optical images. We apply the self-supervised contrastive learning framework NNCLR (Nearest-Neighbor Contrastive Learning of visual Representations) on realistic HSC mock images (g,r,i - bands) produced from galaxies simulated within the TNG50 and TNG100 flagship runs of the IllustrisTNG project. The resulting representation is then used as conditional input for a cINN (conditional Invertible Neural Network) to gain posteriors for merger/assembly statistics, particularly the lookback time and stellar mass of the last major merger and the fraction of ex-situ stars. Through validation against the ground truth available for simulated galaxies, we assess the performance of our model, achieving good accuracy in inferring the stellar ex-situ fraction ($\le \pm 10$ per cent for 80 per cent of the test sample) and the mass of the last major merger (within $\pm 0.5 \log \MSUN$ for stellar masses $&gt;10^{9.5} \MSUN$ ). We successfully apply the TNG-trained model to simulated mocks from the EAGLE simulation, demonstrating that our model is applicable outside of the TNG domain. We use our simulation-based model to infer aspects of the history of observed galaxies, in particular for HSC images that are close to the domain of TNG ones. We recover the trend of increasing ex-situ stellar fraction with stellar mass and more spherical morphology, but we also identify a discrepancy between TNG and HSC: on average, observed galaxies generally exhibit lower ex-situ fractions. Despite challenges such as information loss (e.g. projection effects and surface brightness limits) and domain shifts (from simulations to observations), our results demonstrate the feasibility of extracting the merger past of galaxies from their optical images.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CH3CCH as a thermometer in warm molecular gas</a><span class="id">[2601.19344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kinetic temperature is a fundamental parameter in molecular clouds. Symmetric top molecules, such as NH$_3$ and CH$_3$CCH, are often used as thermometers. However, at high temperatures, NH$_3$(2,2) can be collisionally excited to NH$_3$(2,1) and rapidly decay to NH$_3$(1,1), which can lead to an underestimation of the kinetic temperature when using rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1) and NH$_3$(2,2). In contrast, CH$_3$CCH is a symmetric top molecule with lower critical densities of its rotational levels than those of NH$_3$, which can be thermalized close to the kinetic temperature at relatively low densities of about 10$^{4}$ cm$^{-3}$. To compare the rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) and CH$_3$CCH rotational levels in warm molecular gas, we used observational data toward 55 massive star-forming regions obtained with Yebes 40m and TMRT 65m. Our results show that rotation temperatures derived from NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) are systematically lower than those from CH$_3$CCH 5-4. This suggests that CH$_3$CCH rotational lines with the same $J$+1$\rightarrow$$J$ quantum number may be a more reliable thermometer than NH$_3$(1,1)$\&amp;$(2,2) in warm molecular gas located in the surroundings of massive young stellar objects or, more generally, in massive star-forming regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19522" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variations in the Milky Way's Stellar Mass Function at [Fe/H] &lt; -1</a><span class="id">[2601.19522]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first determination of the Galactic stellar mass function (MF) for low-mass stars (0.2-0.5 M_sun) at metallicities [Fe/H] &lt; -1. A sample of  53,000 stars was selected as metal-poor on the basis of both their halo-like orbits and their spectroscopic [Fe/H] from Gaia DR3 BP/RP (XP) spectra. These metallicity estimates for low-mass stars were enabled by calibrating Gaia XP spectra with stellar parameters from SDSS-V. For -1.5 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1, we find that the MF below 0.5 M_sun exhibits a &quot;bottom-heavy&quot; power-law slope of alpha   -1.6. We tentatively find that at even lower metallicities, the MF becomes very bottom-light, with a near-flat power-law slope of alpha   0 that implies a severe deficit of low-mass stars. This metallicity-dependent variation is insensitive to the adopted stellar evolution model. These results show that the Galactic low-mass MF is not universal, with variations in the metal-poor regime. A further calibration of XP metallicities in the regime of M &lt; 0.5 M_sun and [Fe/H] &lt; -1.5 will be essential to verify these tentative low-metallicity trends.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19524" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A complete survey of filaments in Cygnus X</a><span class="id">[2601.19524]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Filamentary structures are widely observed in molecular clouds, yet most filament observations are biased toward case studies and small samples; a uniform census within a single giant molecular cloud is still missing. We do a complete census of filaments in Cygnus X and quantify their links to dense cores, the magnetic field (B field), and HII regions. Using the updated getsf algorithm on the Cygnus X column-density map, we extracted 2633 filaments and 6551 cores. We built CMFs for cores on and off filaments, compared filament orientations with the Planck B field, measured radial column-density profiles near HII-region boundaries, and computed distances between young stellar objects and filament spines. Filaments have a typical width of 0.5 pc in Cygnus X at a resolution of 0.12 pc and host &gt; 93% of high-mass cores (&gt;= 20 Msun). The on-filament CMF shows a high-mass (&gt; 10 Msun) slope of -2.30, while the off-filament CMF is steeper (-2.83). The onCMF peak mass is well below the Bonnor-Ebert mass, whereas the outCMF peak is comparable to it. At 5' resolution, filaments are mostly perpendicular to the B field except at the lowest column densities; the transition occurs near Av = 10 mag. Prominent filaments and high-mass cores preferred to be located around HII-region boundaries or at intersections of multiple HII regions; filament profiles are steeper on the side facing the HII region. Massive-core formation depends strongly on filaments, which may provide reservoirs that feed cores via accretion. The B field likely regulates filament formation, consistent with the type-O mode (converging flows along an oblique MHD shock) and an HII-driven bubble-filament paradigm for Cygnus X.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19525" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-frequency-selected Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxy Candidates</a><span class="id">[2601.19525]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a pilot study on the host galaxy environments of CHIME/FRBs by cross-matching baseband-localised events with the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2 (LoTSS DR2) at 144 MHz. Unlike traditional methods reliant on optical imaging, our radio-based selection allows for the identification of dust-obscured or optically faint star-forming galaxies. Of the 140 CHIME FRBs considered, 33 lie within the LoTSS DR2 footprint, and 16 show potential radio counterparts. Through multi-wavelength analysis, spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, and redshift constraints from the Macquart relation, we identify two secure and one tentative host candidates, all consistent with active star formation. However, their H$\alpha$-derived star formation rates appear underestimated, likely due to significant dust attenuation, as suggested by infrared colours and compact optical morphologies. Our results highlight the value of low-frequency radio data in complementing optical host searches and demonstrate the feasibility of host identification even in the absence of optical confirmation. With forthcoming data from LoTSS DR3 and the full CHIME/FRB baseband release, this method offers a promising path toward statistically robust studies of FRB host galaxies and their environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An analysis of the J-method from the perspective of the AGB evolution</a><span class="id">[2601.19594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The JAGB method has been proposed as a distance indicator for Local Group galaxies.

The identifications were made using a hybrid method that combines deep learning with ridgeline flux density distribution analysis. Among these sources, 845 are new discoveries. The catalog comprises sources characterized by edge-darkened double jets, an absence of significant bent morphology, and angular sizes ranging from 23 to 159 arcseconds. Optical and/or infrared counterparts have been identified for 813 FR-Is. Among these, the host galaxies are predominantly (88.1\%) red galaxies, with the remainder (11.9\%) being blue galaxies; notably, most blue galaxies exhibit high radio power. The FR-I sample spans a radio power range of $1.20 \times 10^{21} \leq P_{\rm 1400} \leq 3.55 \times 10^{27} \, {\rm W\,Hz}^{-1}$ at 1400 MHz and reaches redshifts up to $z = 2.307$. The host galaxies have $r$-band absolute magnitudes in the range $-24 \lesssim M_r \lesssim -20$ mag. For the 512 FR-Is with estimates, the black hole masses fall within $10^7 \lesssim M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 7.94 \times 10^9 \, M_{\odot}$. Based on optical emission-line ratios and mid-infrared colors, spectroscopic classification shows that 571 hosts are low-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs) and 59 are high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A near-infrared stellar atlas of the Galactic plane from the VVVX survey</a><span class="id">[2601.19708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea eXtended (VVVX) ESO public survey observed the Galactic plane and the outer Galactic bulge in the near-infrared to mitigate the effects of extinction that severely limit optical observations of these regions.

We aim to extend and complete our photometric catalogs of the entire Galactic plane region accessible from the southern hemisphere, focusing on the areas newly covered by the VVVX survey. Building on previous work, we applied point-spread function fitting techniques to detect point sources and extract their deep J, H, and Ks photometry across the VVVX footprint. The resulting catalogs were calibrated using astrometric and photometric reference data. Cross-matching between filters and epochs was used to ensure a high level of reliability and completeness. We produce a deep, highly complete near-infrared catalog of more than 700 million sources in the Galactic plane and outer Galactic bulge. When combined with our previous VVV atlas, the full catalog includes over 1.5 billion sources. The derived density maps and color-magnitude diagrams enable detailed studies of Galactic structure, extinction, and stellar populations, and highlight features such as the Carina arm tangency, the Sagittarius stream, and numerous star clusters. This extended atlas provides an unprecedented view of the innermost regions of the Milky Way.

We investigate the impact of diffuse ionised gas (DIG) on the determination of emission line ratios and gas-phase metallicities in two local analogues of high-redshift star-forming galaxies: UM 462 and IIZw 40. Understanding how DIG affects these quantities is essential for interpreting unresolved observations of distant galaxies, where integrated spectra are often used to trace their chemical evolution. Methods. Using archival Very Large Telescope, Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data, we spatially resolved the warm ionised medium of both galaxies. We derived oxygen abundances through the direct method and several HII-based strong-line calibrators, and we used the H$\alpha$ surface brightness ($\Sigma$(H$\alpha$)) to distinguish regions dominated by HII or DIG emission. Results. Oxygen abundances derived from the N2 and O3N2 indices show an inverse correlation with $\Sigma$(H$\alpha$), ionisation parameter, and EW(H$\alpha$), with DIG-dominated regions exhibiting higher 12+log(O/H) than the galaxy mean by $\sim$0.2 dex in UM 462 and $\sim$0.1 dex in IIZw 40. The metallicity differences between HII-dominated and DIG-dominated $\Sigma$(H$\alpha$) bins reach $\sim$0.4 dex and $\sim$0.3 dex in UM 462 and IIZw 40, respectively. The observed trends with $\Sigma$(H$\alpha$), metallicity, EW(H$\alpha$), and ionisation parameter indicate smoothly varying ionisation conditions rather than true abundance variations. These effects reflect different ionisation sources and levels, and can produce spurious metallicity gradients in galaxies with extended DIG structures, potentially mimicking signatures of metal-poor gas infall. In our sample, DIG ionisation is most likely dominated by photon leakage from H II regions, with additional contributions from feedback-driven shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19842" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Evidence for a Billion Solar Mass Black Hole in Galaxy NGC 4061 from ALMA $^{12}$CO(2-1) Kinematics</a><span class="id">[2601.19842]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first robust dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the massive early-type galaxy NGC 4061 using high-spatial-resolution ALMA observations of the $^{12}$CO(2-1) emission. By combining archival Cycle 6 data with new Cycle 7 observations, we achieve a synthesized beam of $0''.16 \times 0''.13$, comparable to the expected sphere of influence of the central black hole. The molecular gas forms a regularly rotating circumnuclear disk aligned with the prominent dust lane seen in HST imaging. We model the full three-dimensional ALMA data cube using the KinMS forward-modeling framework, exploring both data-driven and analytic prescriptions for the gas surface brightness distribution. Our Bayesian analysis yields a best-fitting SMBH mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (1.17^{+0.08}_{-0.10}\,[{\rm stat.}] \pm 0.43\,[{\rm syst.}]) \times 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$ and an $I$-band stellar mass-to-light ratio of $M/L_{\rm F814W} = 3.46^{+0.07}_{-0.06}\,[{\rm stat.}] \pm 0.10\,[{\rm syst.}]$ M$_\odot$/L$_\odot$. The inferred black hole mass is fully consistent across different modeling assumptions and remains insensitive to plausible radial variations in the $M/L_{\rm F814W}$ profile. Our results resolve the long-standing discrepancy between previous indirect mass estimates based on conflicting stellar velocity dispersion measurements and demonstrate that the exceptionally large dispersion reported in the literature is likely spurious. This study highlights the power of high-resolution ALMA molecular gas kinematics for precision SMBH mass measurements at the high-mass end of the local black hole mass function.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt cusps in hierarchical dark matter halos: Implications for annihilation boost</a><span class="id">[2601.19863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent simulations have identified long-lived “prompt cusps” – compact remnants of early density peaks with inner profiles $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$. They can survive hierarchical assembly and potentially enhance signals of dark matter annihilation. In this work, we incorporate prompt cusps into the semi-analytic substructure framework \textsc{SASHIMI}, enabling a fully hierarchical, environment-dependent calculation of the annihilation luminosity that consistently tracks subhalos, sub-subhalos, and tidal stripping. We assign prompt cusps to first-generation microhalos and propagate their survival through the merger history, including an explicit treatment of cusps associated with stripped substructure. We find that the substructure hierarchy converges rapidly once a few levels are included, and that prompt cusps can raise the total annihilation boost of Milky-Way–size hosts at $z=0$ to $B\sim O(10)$ for fiducial cusp-occupation assumptions, compared to a subhalo-only baseline of $B_{\rm sh}\sim\mathrm{few}$. Across a wide range of host masses and redshifts, prompt cusps increase the normalization of $B(M_{\rm host},z)$ while largely preserving its mass and redshift trends. Compared to universal-average, peak-based estimates, our fiducial boosts are lower by about an order of magnitude, primarily reflecting a correspondingly smaller inferred cusp abundance in host halos, highlighting the importance of unifying peak-based cusp formation with merger-tree evolution and environmental dependence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of Galactic center ejected star in DESI DR1</a><span class="id">[2601.19866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are stars ejected from the Galactic Centre (GC) through tidal interactions with the central supermassive black hole.

Using spectroscopy from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and astrometry from Gaia, we conducted a six-dimensional search for HVSs and identified a compelling candidate, hereafter DESI-312, whose bound trajectory can be confidently traced back to the GC. The star resides in the inner halo and exhibits supersolar metallicity ([Fe/H] $= 0.27\pm 0.09$), distinct from other known stellar populations with radial orbits. Its inferred GC ejection velocity of $698^{+35}_{-27}$ is consistent with a Hills mechanism ejection, supporting an origin in the innermost regions of the Milky Way. We considered alternative origins for the star, including disk ejections from young clusters and globular clusters, but these scenarios fail to explain both its orbit and metallicity.

Nevertheless, experimental confirmation of this structure would constitute direct evidence for gravity as a quantum force mediated by gravitons. If gravity instead arises from spacetime curvature, neutrinos interact only via the short range weak force and are therefore effectively collisionless. In this regime, neutrinos behave as free classical particles orbiting the galaxy and experience no Fermi pressure. We show that such a population can be sufficiently compact to reproduce the Milky Way rotation curve, making neutrinos viable dark matter candidates. The extremely small neutrino antineutrino annihilation cross section further implies near equilibrium between neutrinos and antineutrinos, potentially addressing the matter antimatter asymmetry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19123" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiral Density Waves and Torque Balance in the Kerr Geometry</a><span class="id">[2601.19123]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) in relativistic accretion discs are a key science target for the upcoming LISA mission.

In this work we address this gap by providing the relativistic calculation. We apply standard methods from self-force theory, black hole perturbation theory, and relativistic stellar perturbation theory to perform the full fluid calculation of the relativistic analogue of planetary migration for the first time. We calculate the response of a fluid in the perturbing potential of an EMRI consistently incorporating pressure effects. Using a master enthalpy-like variable and linearised fluid theory, we reconstruct the fluid perturbations and relativistic spiral arm structure for a range of spin values in the Kerr geometry. We conclude by deriving a relativistic torque-balance equation that enables computation and comparison of local torques with advected angular momentum through the disc. This opens a promising route towards establishing torque-balance relations between integrated disc torques arising from fluid perturbations and the forces acting on EMRIs embedded in matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A sudden dramatic change and recovery of magneto-environment of a repeating fast radio burst</a><span class="id">[2503.04727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio bursts with unidentified extra-galactic origin.

Their dynamics encode information about their formation and growth, the composition of their host galactic nuclei, the evolution of galaxies, and the nature of gravity. Many SMBH binaries with separations pc-kpc have been found, but closer (sub-parsec) binaries remain to be confirmed. Identifying these systems may elucidate how binaries evolve past the “final parsec” until gravitational radiation drives them to coalescence. Here we show that SMBH binaries in non-active galactic nuclei can be identified and characterized by the gravitational lensing of individual bright stars, located behind them in the host galaxy. The rotation of `caustics' – regions where sources are hugely magnified due to the SMBH binary's orbit and inspiral – leads to Quasi-Periodic Lensing of Starlight (QPLS). The extreme lensing magnification of individual bright stars produces a significant variation in the host galaxies' luminosity; their lightcurve traces the orbit of the SMBH binary and its evolution. QPLS probes the population of sources observable by pulsar timing arrays and space detectors (LISA, TianQin), offering advance warning triggers for merging SMBHs for coincident or follow-up GW detections. SMBH population models predict $1-50\; [190-5,000] \left({n_\star}/{\rm pc}^{-3}\right)$ QPLS binaries with period less than $10\; [40]$ yr with comparable masses and $z&lt;0.3$, where $n_\star$ is the stellar number density. Additionally, stellar and orbital motion will lead to frequent instances of single/double flares caused by SMBHBs with longer periods. This novel signature can be searched for in a wealth of existing and upcoming time-domain photometric data: identifying quasi-periodic variability in galactic lightcurves will reveal an ensemble of binary systems and illuminate outstanding questions around them.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Correlation between H$α$ emitters and their cosmic web environment at $z \sim 1$</a><span class="id">[2506.23140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Future near-infrared spectroscopic galaxy surveys will target high-redshift emission-line galaxies (ELGs) to test cosmological models.

By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic and sinusoidal AGN variability is exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting it on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple sinusoidal periodicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Milky Way gravitationally stable?

We find that these galaxies remain stable to axisymmetric instabilities at all epochs, with $Q_{T}^{\min}&gt;2$. The stability levels increase toward higher redshift, where enhanced gas velocity dispersion counterbalances the destabilizing effect of larger gas fractions. Further, the barred MWAs consistently show lower $Q_{T}^{\min}$ than unbarred ones. The gas density remains subcritical ($\Sigma_{g}&lt;\Sigma_{c}$) across radii and epochs, implying that local axisymmetric instabilities are not the primary channel for star formation. Growth timescales are short (a few Myr) in central regions but increase exponentially to several Gyr in the outer disc, naturally explaining the concentration of star formation toward galactic centers. We study the effect of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM and find that while MWAs are stable against axisymmetric instabilities $(Q_{T}&gt;1)$, a combination of gas dissipation and turbulence in ISM can destabilize the disc at small scales even when $Q_{T}&gt;1$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The life of central radio galaxies in clusters: AGN-ICM studies of eRASS1 clusters in the ASKAP fields</a><span class="id">[2511.22319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mechanical feedback from the central AGNs can be crucial for balancing the radiative cooling of the intracluster medium at the cluster centre.

We used catalogues from the first SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) along with ASKAP radio data. In total, we identified 134 radio sources associated with BCGs of the 151 eRASS1 clusters located in the PS1, PS2, and SWAG-X ASKAP fields. Non-detections were treated as upper limits. We correlated BCG radio luminosity, largest linear size (LLS), and BCG offset with the integrated X-ray luminosity of their host clusters. To characterise cool cores (CCs) and non-cool cores (NCCs), we used the concentration parameter $c_{R_{500}}$ and combined it with the BCG offset to assess cluster dynamical state. We analysed the correlation between radio mechanical power and X-ray luminosity within the CC subsample. We observe a potential positive trend between LLS and BCG offset, suggesting an environmental effect on radio-source morphology. We find a weak trend where more luminous central radio galaxies are found in clusters with higher X-ray luminosity. Within the CC subsample, there is a positive but highly scattered relationship between the mechanical luminosity of AGN jets and the X-ray cooling luminosity. This finding is supported by bootstrap resampling and flux-flux analyses. The correlation indicates that AGN feedback is ineffective in high-luminosity (high-mass) clusters. At a cooling luminosity of $L_{\mathrm{X},~r&lt;R_\mathrm{cool}}\approx 5.50\times10^{43}$ erg/s, on average, AGN feedback appears to contribute only about 13%-22% of the energy needed to offset the radiative losses in the ICM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint Optical-HI mock catalogs and prospects for upcoming HI surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.06815]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atomic hydrogen (HI) regulates star formation as cold gas fuels star formation. It represents a key phase of matter in the baryon cycle involving accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. Redshifted $21$ cm line emission originating from galaxies serves as a key tracer for investigating HI gas and its dynamics in the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), and enables the study of galaxy evolution. Nonetheless, direct detections of HI are currently limited to $z \leq 0.4$ due to the inherently weak $21$ cm emission line. Ongoing and upcoming large radio surveys aim to detect $21$ cm emission from galaxies up to $z \gtrsim 1$ with unprecedented sensitivity. In current work, we present a novel approach for creating optical-HI joint mock catalogs for upcoming SKA precursor surveys: MIGHTEE-HI and LADUMA with MeerKAT and WALLABY with ASKAP. Incorporation of optical properties along with HI in our mock catalogs makes these a powerful tool for making predictions for upcoming surveys and provides a benchmark for exploring the HI science (e.g., conditional HIMF and optical-to-HI scaling relations) expected from these surveys. As a case study, we show the use of the joint catalogs for predicting the expected outcome of stacking detection for average HI mass in galaxies that are below the threshold for direct detection. We show that combining stacking observations with the number of direct detections puts a strong constraint on the HI mass function, especially in the regime where the number of direct detections is small, as often happens near the farther edge of HI surveys.

We find that rotational H$_2$ excitation temperatures are elevated ( 500 K higher) compared to both higher-luminosity AGN and star-forming galaxies, while the H$_2$(0-0)S(3)/PAH$_{11.3 \mu m}$ ratios are consistent with those observed in the AGN population. We discuss the possible roles of outflows, jets, and X-ray dominated regions in shaping the interstellar medium surrounding LLAGN. Silicate emission at  10 $\mu$m, localized to the nuclear region, is detected in most ReveaLLAGN targets. This dataset offers the first comprehensive JWST-based characterization of infrared emission lines in the nuclear regions of LLAGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gas Kinematics and Cosmic-Ray Acceleration in the Gamma-ray SNRs W41 and G22.7-0.2</a><span class="id">[2601.18040]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of the interstellar medium associated with the two middle-aged supernova remnants (SNRs) W41 and G22.7-0.2, both detected in TeV gamma-rays. Using high-angular-resolution $^{12}$CO($J$ = 1-0) data from the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and HI data from the VLA, we investigated the spatial and kinematic properties of molecular and atomic gas that interact with the SNRs. We identified associated clouds in the velocity ranges of +50-+80 km s$^{-1}$ for W41 and +76-+110 km s$^{-1}$ for G22.7-0.2. Column density analysis indicates that target protons are dominated by molecular hydrogen, while atomic hydrogen contributes less than $\sim$10-15% even after correction for self-absorption. The mean proton densities are $\sim$1.2$\times$10$^{3}$ cm$^{-3}$ for W41 and $\sim$5.3$\times$10$^{2}$ cm$^{-3}$ for G22.7-0.2. From the gamma-ray luminosities, we estimate the total energy of accelerated cosmic-ray protons as $W_\mathrm{p}$ $\sim$3$\times$10$^{47}$ erg for W41 and $\sim$1$\times$10$^{48}$ erg for G22.7-0.2, corresponding to 0.03-0.1% of the canonical supernova explosion energy. hese $W_\mathrm{p}$ values agree with the decreasing trend in $W_\mathrm{p}$ observed in the middle-aged SNRs within the previously reported SNR age-$W_\mathrm{p}$ relation.</p></div></details></article>

Standard frequency-domain implementations, such as the FINDCHIRP algorithm, rely on streaming long template waveforms and data from main memory, which leads to significant processor stalling when template durations exceed cache capacities. In this work, we introduce \textit{Ratio-Filter Dechirping} as a solution, an algorithmic restructuring of the matched filter that transforms the operation from a memory-bound Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) into a cache-efficient, compute-bound Finite Impulse Response (FIR) convolution. By utilizing a reference template to remove common orbital phase evolution, we produce slowly changing frequency-domain ratios that can be accurately implemented as short FIR filters. This method delivers a measured speedup of $8\times$ for the core filtering loop used in offline searches and should enable $&gt;10\times$ for low-latency analysis. We find that this approach generalizes to a variety of searches that include physical features such as finite size effects, eccentricity, and precession. By dramatically reducing the computational cost of matched filtering, this approach enables the expansion of searches into dense or high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as those for eccentric or subsolar-mass signals, that are already limited by available computing budgets. Furthermore, this framework provides a natural path for hardware acceleration on GPU architectures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Towards a Comprehensive Understanding of Planetary Systems through Population-Level, Large-Scale Surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.18841]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past three decades, exoplanet research has delivered an extensive census of planets spanning a wide range of masses, sizes, and orbital configurations. Despite this progress, the physical interpretation of these populations remains severely limited, as precise constraints on planetary masses, interior structures, and atmospheres are available only for a small, highly selected subset of targets. As a result, most known exoplanets remain physically ambiguous, preventing the construction of robust population-level trends and limiting our understanding of planet formation, evolution, and habitability. In the coming decades, missions such as PLATO, Earth 2.0, and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will dramatically expand the number of exoplanets detected. However, without a corresponding capability to characterise planetary masses and atmospheres at scale, these discoveries will remain largely detection-driven. Current and planned facilities, including JWST and ELT-class instruments, excel at detailed studies of individual systems but are intrinsically unsuited for large, homogeneous surveys. This white paper identifies population-level physical characterisation as a fundamental science challenge for the 2040s and motivates the need for a new observational paradigm. We outline how photonics-enabled, modular telescope architectures can deliver the survey speed, stability, and scalability required to jointly probe planetary interiors and atmospheres across statistically meaningful samples, thereby enabling a comprehensive and physically grounded understanding of planetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainties in Low-Count STIS Spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.18910]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We evaluate uncertainty calculations in the calstis pipeline for data in the low-count regime. Due to the low dark rate and read-noise free nature of MAMA detectors, observations of UV-dim sources can result in exposures with 0 or 1 counts in some pixels. In this regime, the &quot;root-N&quot; approximation widely used to calculate uncertainties breaks down, and one must compute Poisson confidence intervals for more accurate uncertainty calculations. The CalCOS pipeline was updated in 2020 to account for these low-count uncertainties. Here, we assess how STIS observations are currently affected by this phenomenon, describe a new Jupyter notebook exploring the issue, and introduce a new utility, stistools.poisson_err, to manually calculate Poisson confidence intervals for 1D STIS spectra. Additionally, we describe a related software bug in the this http URL utility, which splits TIME-TAG data into sub-exposures. This newly fixed bug serves as a useful case-study for the proper use of Poisson confidence intervals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Development of Electroformed X-ray Optics Bridging Synchrotron Technology and Space Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2601.19188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have developed X-ray telescope mirrors using an original electroforming replication technique established through the fabrication of millimeter-aperture, ultra-short-focal-length nanofocusing mirrors for synchrotron X-ray microscopy. This paper presents detailed results of X-ray illumination tests of a 60-mm-diameter, full-circumference, double-reflection monolithic electroformed nickel mirror and its Mirror Module Assembly (MMA). The experiments were conducted at the 1-km beamline BL29XUL at SPring-8. To simulate a parallel X-ray beam from celestial sources, we constructed a dedicated evaluation system, the High-Brilliance X-ray Kilometer-long Large-Area Expanded-beam Evaluation System (HBX-KLAEES). Owing to the high photon flux and the quasi-point-like source with a small divergence provided by HBX-KLAEES, the imaging performance was evaluated with high fidelity, resolving both the sharp core and large-angle components of the Point Spread Function (PSF). The results show an extremely sharp core with a Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of 0.7 arcsec and a Half Power Diameter (HPD) of 14 arcsec, even after integration into the MMA. In addition, a positive correlation was found between angular resolution and axial figure error in both the primary and secondary mirror sections, indicating that axial figure errors contribute to image degradation. Based on these results, the MMA was selected as one of the hard X-ray optics for the FOXSI-4 sounding rocket experiment, which performs high-resolution soft and hard X-ray imaging spectroscopy of solar flares and was successfully launched. These results demonstrate the potential for further improvements in angular resolution and the development of high-resolution, ultra-short focal length X-ray optics for small satellites, including CubeSats.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia serial CTI modelling and radiation damage study</a><span class="id">[2601.19353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the course of its mission, ESA's Gaia spacecraft has generated a map of the stars of the Galaxy of exquisite detail. While in its L2 orbit, the satellite has been exposed to high energy cosmic rays and solar particles, that caused permanent damage to its CCDs. The main effect of radiation damage on Gaia data is the distortion of its images and spectra, caused by the CCDs charge transfer inefficiency (CTI) during the readout process, that, if not taken into account, can result in inaccurate measurements of a star's location and flux. In this work, the impact of CTI in the serial readout direction, larger than in the parallel due to the presence of CCDs manufacturing defects, has been analysed and modelled. A pixel-based, physically motivated CTI model, CtiPixel, has been developed to characterise the damage in Gaia CCDs. The model has been calibrated using dedicated serial CTI diagnostic data, taken every 3-4 months over the course of the mission. The model is shown to be a good representation of the observed signatures of CTI in the calibration datasets, and its parameters reveal significant insights into the nature of the CCD defects generated by space irradiation. The evolution of the damage in the serial direction shows a general small linear increase over time, with sudden step changes after strong solar flares and coronal mass ejections directed towards Earth. The serial CTI showed a further step increase as a consequence of the engineering CCD annealing experiment carried out after the completion of Gaia science observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silicon-based vacuum window for millimeter and submillimeter-wave astrophysics</a><span class="id">[2601.19627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We designed, fabricated, and characterized the properties of a silicon-based vacuum window suitable for millimeter-wave astrophysical applications.

We validate RICK's correctness and performance against real observational data from both MeerKAT and LOFAR. Our results demonstrate that the HeFFTe-based implementation offers substantial performance advantages, particularly when running on GPUs, and scales effectively with large pixel resolutions and a high number of frequency planes. This new architecture overcomes the critical scaling limitations identified in previous work (Paper II, Paper III), where communication overheads consumed up to 96% of the runtime due to the necessity of communicating the entire grid.

Similar to EM waves, gravitational waves (GWs) can also be lensed. When their wavelength is comparable to the characteristic scale of the lens, wave-optics (WO) effects manifest as frequency-dependent modulations in the GW waveform. These WO features encode valuable information about the lensing system but are challenging to model, especially in the weak lensing regime, which has a larger optical depth than strong lensing. We present a novel and efficient framework to accurately approximate WO effects induced by general symmetric lens profiles. Our method is validated against numerical calculations and recovers the expected asymptotic behavior in both high- and low-frequency limits. Accurate and efficient modeling of WO effects in the weak lensing regime will enable improved lens reconstruction, delensing of standard sirens, and provide a unique probe to the properties of low-mass halos with minimal baryonic content, offering new insights into the nature of dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconsidering the consistent use of precessing, higher order multipole models for gravitational wave analyses</a><span class="id">[2601.18916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The growing number of gravitational-wave (GW) observations allows for constraints to be placed on the underlying population of black holes; current estimates show that black hole spins are small, with binaries more likely to have comparable component masses. Since general relativistic effects, such as spin-induced orbital precession and higher order multipole moments, are more likely to be observed for asymmetric binary systems, a direct measurement remains unlikely. Nevertheless, we continue to consistently probe these effects by performing Bayesian inference with our most accurate and computationally expensive models. As the number of GW detections increases, it may soon become infeasible to consistently use these models for analyses. In this paper, we provide a selection criterion that determines when less accurate and computationally cheaper models can be used without giving biased estimates for the population properties of black holes in the Universe. We show that when using our selection criterion, comparable estimates can be obtained for the underlying mass and spin distribution of black holes for a simulated &quot;worst-case&quot; scenario population, while reducing the overall cost of performing Bayesian inference on our population by $\sim 20\%$. We anticipate a reduction of up to $78\%$ in the overall cost for an astrophysically motivated population, since there are fewer events with observable spin-precession and higher order multipole power.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Rays as an Interdisciplinary Earth Observation Tool: From Particle Physics and Atmospheric Processes to Geosciences and Urban Science</a><span class="id">[2601.19265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The exploration of cosmic rays, which are high-energy particles originate from space and the atmosphere, has historically been associated with particle physics and astrophysics. In the last 20 years, these particles have evolved into valuable tools for observing Earth's systems. This review compiles the use of cosmic rays in three primary areas: (1) particle physics and atmospheric processes, which include cosmic-ray-induced cascades, ionization, and their impact on atmospheric chemistry and radiation; (2) geosciences, where cosmogenic radionuclides assist in the dating of geological materials and cosmic-ray neutrons are used for large-scale monitoring of soil moisture and snow water equivalents; and (3) urban science, where cosmic-ray muons are employed for non-invasive subsurface imaging and, when paired with distributed sensors, serve as the basis for smart city monitoring.

The TESs calorimeter of the telescope will be readout by a time-division multiplexer (TDM) SQUID readout system. We develop a two-stage dc-SQUID amplifier circuit, comprising an input-stage SQUID with 4 SQUID cells and a series SQUID array (SSA) with 100 SQUID cells. This configuration has been shown to achieve extremely high signal gain while effectively controlling system noise. We assess the system noise at $300$ $mK$ in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator (ADR). The the measured magnetic flux noise of the two-stage SQUID circuit system is approximately $0.3$ ${\mu}\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at $10$ $kHz$.

A logical application of these algorithms is the detection of unresolved stellar binaries, which requires accurate spectroscopic models to resolve flux contributions from a fainter secondary star in the spectrum. Here we use The Cannon to train a data-driven model on spectra from the Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer. We show that our model is competitive with existing data-driven models in its ability to predict stellar properties Teff, stellar radius, [Fe/H], vsin(i), and instrumental PSF, particularly when we apply a novel wavelet-based processing step to spectra before training. We find that even with accurate estimates of star properties, our model's ability to detect unresolved binaries is limited by its approx. 3% accuracy in per-pixel flux predictions, illuminating possible limitations of data-driven model applications.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitable Worlds Observatory's Concept and Technology Maturation: Initial Feasibility and Trade Space Exploration</a><span class="id">[2601.11803]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Habitable Worlds Observatory is the first telescope ever designed to search for life and will be a powerhouse of discovery across topics in astrophysics.

In this work, we demonstrate that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are an effective way to lower the threshold. We developed two CNNs: a classifier to distinguish radio signal waveforms from background noise and a denoiser to clean contaminated radio signals. Following the training and testing phases, we applied the networks to air-shower data triggered by scintillation detectors of the prototype station for the enhancement of IceTop, IceCube's surface array at the South Pole. Over a four-month period, we identified 554 cosmic-ray events in coincidence with IceTop, approximately five times more compared to a reference method based on a cut on the signal-to-noise ratio. Comparisons with IceTop measurements of the same air showers confirmed that the CNNs reliably identified cosmic-ray radio pulses and outperformed the reference method.

We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters.
