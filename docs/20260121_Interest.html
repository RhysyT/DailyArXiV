<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">100 Glorious Years of the Ising Model</a><span class="id">[2601.11671]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is an editorial article based on the reseaches on the Ising model over the last 100 years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physical probability in the Everett interpretation and Bell inequalities</a><span class="id">[2601.12159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I define a notion of locality LOC, closely modelled on the Bell principle of Local Causality, construed as the condition that single case probabilities cannot be modified by actions at spacelike separation. The new principle, like that of Bell, forces Bell inequalities, but with two loopholes: one is violation of measurement independence, known to Bell, but the other is non-uniqueness of remote outcomes, a loophole only for LOC, not for Local Causality. I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in which the Born rule is derived, and which therefore violates Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited. I conclude not only that physical probability in the Everett interpretation involves no action at a distance, but that the observed violation of Bell inequalities is powerful evidence for many worlds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noncontextual versus contextual interferometry</a><span class="id">[2601.13109]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Feynman famously said that single-particle interference is “a phenomenon which is impossible to explain in any classical way, and which has in it the heart of quantum mechanics.” In this paper we show that some of the phenomenology of interference can be reproduced in a “classical” way, by reproducing the Elitzur-Vaidman Bomb Tester (including their improved version) using an extension of the quantum simulation logic (QSL) formalism. Our result improves and simplifies a previous result by Catani \emph{et al}, which relies on a much more complicated extension involving a “toy field theory.” We also show that not all single-particle interference can be explained by such a simple extension (including that of Catani et al), by showing that Hofmann's three-path interferometer is “nonclassical” in a very specific sense: it violates a Kochen-Specker-noncontextual inequality. Given that both our extension of QSL and Catani et al's extension are \emph{noncontextual} – so do not reproduce the contextual behaviour of Hofmann's three-path interferometer – the behaviour of that interferometer is a proper example of a phenomenon that has in it the heart of quantum mechanics, according to Feynman.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Typical Quantum States of the Universe are Observationally Indistinguishable</a><span class="id">[2410.16860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We establish three impossibility results regarding our knowledge of the quantum state of the universe. Suppose the universal quantum state is a typical unit vector in a high-dimensional subspace $\mathscr{H}_0$ of Hilbert space $\mathscr{H}$, such as the low-entropy subspace defined by the Past Hypothesis. We show that: (1) Any particular observation is incapable of identifying the universal state vector in $\mathscr{H}_0$ or substantially reducing the set of possibilities. In other words, the overwhelming majority of possible state vectors are observationally indistinguishable from each other. (2) For any reasonably probable measurement outcome and for most pairs of vectors in $\mathscr{H}_0$, that outcome will not appreciably favor one vector over the other. (3) Bayesian updating on any measurement result, unless it is extraordinarily improbable, has a negligible effect on the initial uniform probability distribution over the states in $\mathscr{H}_0$. These findings represent the most stringent epistemic constraints known for a quantum universe and are derived from a typicality theorem in quantum statistical mechanics. We close by considering how theoretical considerations beyond empirical evidence might inform our understanding of this fact and our knowledge of the universal quantum state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</a><span class="id">[2601.03567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (deBroglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf{1}^2[\mathcal{C}]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schrödinger, Pauli, and Dirac equations coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AMACA: Astronomy education with a Multi-sensory, Accessible, and Circular Approach</a><span class="id">[2601.13326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The AMACA project (Astronomy education with a Multi-sensory, Accessible, and Circular Approach) develops multi-sensory activities for accessible education and engagement in astronomy. Despite promising innovations, existing resources are often poorly documented, designed for one-time events, expensive, and lack interdisciplinary collaboration, user testing, and broad dissemination. AMACA addresses these challenges by creating multi-sensory activities for education and outreach, with a particular focus on accessibility for people with sensory disabilities. A circular approach informs its educational structure: (1) a PhD course on multi-sensory astronomy outreach develops hands-on activities with the support of astronomers, psychologists, and organizations for the visually impaired and the deaf; (2) PhD candidates teach High School (HS) students how to deliver the activities; (3) HS students lead the activities at the Astronomy Festival &quot;The Universe in All Senses&quot;; (4) HS students train teachers to implement the activities in their classrooms. AMACA also develops tools to guide project development and track participants' learning. Key findings show improved communication and accessibility awareness among PhD candidates, increased emotional engagement with astronomy among HS students, enhanced public engagement with research and accessibility awareness, and high teacher satisfaction with the flipped-roles, hands-on approach. Overall, AMACA enhances accessibility and engagement in astronomy education across audiences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It's Not The Plane – It's The Pilot: A Framework for Cognitive-Activated AI-Augmentation to Avoid the Boiling Frog Problem</a><span class="id">[2601.13812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) systems can now reliably solve many standard tasks used in introductory physics courses, producing correct equations, graphs, and explanations. While this capability is often framed as an opportunity for efficiency or personalization, it also poses a subtle ethical and educational risk: students may increasingly submit correct results without engaging in the epistemic practices that define learning this http URL challenge has recently been described as the &quot;boiling frog problem&quot; because we may not fully recognize how rapidly AI capabilities are advancing and fail to respond with commensurate urgency. In this article, we argue that the central challenge of AI in physics education is not cheating or tool selection, but instructional design. Drawing on research on self-regulated learning, cognitive load, multiple representations, and hybrid intelligence, we propose a practical framework for cognitively activated learning activities that structures student activities before, during, and after AI use. Using an example from an introductory kinematics laboratory, we show how AI can be integrated in ways that preserve prediction, interpretation, and evaluation as core learning activities. Rather than treating AI as an answer-generating tool, the framework positions AI as an epistemic partner whose contributions are deliberately bounded and reflected upon.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The physics of cranberry bogs</a><span class="id">[2601.11593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The common New England sight of a cranberry bog presents a rich tapestry of fluid dynamics and soft matter phenomena. Here, we present four connected problems exploring the behavior of cranberries in their stages of harvest: the buoyant rise of a cranberry in a flooded bog, the stable floating configuration of a cranberry on the surface, the aggregation and interaction between many floating cranberries collected with a boom, and the piling of cranberries onto a truck for transportation. We model these phenomena from first principles and develop simple computational simulations of their collective behaviors. Additionally, we describe tabletop experiments to accompany these problems, either as in-class demonstrations or lab activities. Throughout, we draw connections to broader physical principles in soft condensed matter and fluids, allowing the real-world example of the cranberry bog to serve as a bridge between the undergraduate curriculum and topics in soft matter research.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</a><span class="id">[2601.12029]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08933" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Graduate education in optics in Japan and the United States: impact of funding levels on educational structure</a><span class="id">[2401.08933]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compare the optical science &amp; engineering graduate-level educational environments at two universities in two countries: Utsunomiya University in Japan, and the University of Arizona in the United States. Because the university education systems in the two countries are so different, we also explain how financial resources drive many of these differences and discuss how these impact student and faculty life.</p></div></details></article></body>
