Current semi-supervised clustering algorithms do not always fully address this duality, often assuming that supervisory signals are globally representative. Consequently, methods often enforce rigid constraints that suppress unanticipated patterns or require a pre-specified number of clusters, rendering them ineffective for genuine novelty detection. To bridge this gap, we introduce CLiMB (CLustering in Multiphase Boundaries), a domain-informed framework decoupling the exploitation of prior knowledge from the exploration of unknown structures. Using a sequential two-phase approach, CLiMB first anchors known clusters using constrained partitioning, and subsequently applies density-based clustering to residual data to reveal arbitrary topologies. We demonstrate this framework on RR Lyrae stars data from the Gaia Data Release 3. CLiMB attains an Adjusted Rand Index of 0.829 with 90% seed coverage in recovering known Milky Way substructures, drastically outperforming heuristic and constraint-based baselines, which stagnate below 0.20. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirms CLiMB's superior data efficiency, showing monotonic improvement as knowledge increases. Finally, the framework successfully isolates three dynamical features (Shiva, Shakti, and the Galactic Disk) in the unlabelled field, validating its potential for scientific discovery.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09778" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The X-Ray Dot: Exotic Dust or a Late-Stage Little Red Dot?</a><span class="id">[2601.09778]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST's &quot;Little Red Dots&quot; (LRDs) are increasingly interpreted as active galactic nuclei (AGN) obscured by dense thermalized gas rather than dust as evidenced by their X-ray weakness, blackbody-like continua, and Balmer line profiles. A key question is how LRDs connect to standard UV-luminous AGN and whether transitional phases exist and if they are observable. We present the &quot;X-Ray Dot&quot; (XRD), a compact source at $z=3.28$ observed by the NIRSpec WIDE GTO survey. The XRD exhibits LRD hallmarks: a blackbody-like ($T_{\rm eff} \simeq 6400\,$K) red continuum, a faint but blue rest-UV excess, falling mid-IR emission, and broad Balmer lines ($\rm FWHM \sim 2700-3200\,km\,s^{-1}$). Unlike LRDs, however, it is remarkably X-ray luminous ($L_\textrm{2$-$10$ $keV} = 10^{44.18}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$) and has a continuum inflection that is bluewards of the Balmer limit. We find that the red rest-optical and blue mid-IR continuum cannot be reproduced by standard dust-attenuated AGN models without invoking extremely steep extinction curves, nor can the weak mid-IR emission be reconciled with well-established X-ray–torus scaling relations. We therefore consider an alternative scenario: the XRD may be an LRD in transition, where the gas envelope dominates the optical continuum but optically thin sightlines allow X-rays to escape. The XRD may thus provide a physical link between LRDs and standard AGN, offering direct evidence that LRDs are powered by supermassive black holes and providing insight into their accretion properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09780" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Breathless BEARS: [O$_{\rm \,III}$] 88$μ$m Emission of Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at $z = 3-4$</a><span class="id">[2601.09780]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present [O$_{\rm \,III}$] 88$\mu$m observations towards four ${\it Herschel}$-selected dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs; log$_{10}$ $\mu$L$_{\rm IR}$/L$_{\odot}$ = 13.5 - 14 at $z = 2.9 - 4$) using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA) in Bands 9 and 10. We detect [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission in all four targets at &gt;3$\sigma$, finding line luminosity ratios ($L_{\rm [O_{\rm \,III}]}$ / L$_{\rm IR}$ = 10$^{-4.2}$ to 10$^{-3}$) similar to local spiral galaxies, and an order of magnitude lower when compared with local dwarf galaxies as well as high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Using the short-wavelength capabilities of the ACA, these observations bridge the populations of galaxies with [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission at low redshift from space missions and at high redshift from ground-based studies. The difference in [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission between these DSFGs and other high-redshift galaxies reflects their more evolved stellar populations (&gt; 10 Myr), larger dust reservoirs (M$_{\rm dust}$ $\sim$ 10$^{9 - 11}$ M$_{\odot}$), metal-rich interstellar medium ($Z \sim 0.5 - 2$ Z$_{\odot}$), and likely weaker ionization radiation fields. Ancillary [C$_{\rm \,II}$] emission on two targets provide $L_{[{\rm O}_{\rm \,III}]} / L_{[{\rm C}_{\rm \,II}]}$ ratios at 0.3 - 0.9, suggesting that ionized gas represents a smaller fraction of the total gas reservoir in DSFGs, consistent with theoretical models of DSFGs as transitional systems between gas-rich, turbulent disks and more evolved, gas-poor galaxies. Expanding samples of DSFGs with [O$_{\rm \,III}$] emission will be key to place this heterogeneous, poorly-understood galactic phase in its astrophysical context.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growing in number, passive in nature: tracing the evolution of the most massive quiescent galaxies since z   0.8 with BOSS and DESI</a><span class="id">[2601.09789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) are among the most massive galaxies at any epoch, and lack ongoing star formation. As systems hosting most of the baryonic mass in the local Universe, they preserve imprints of the quenching mechanisms in the early Universe. We exploited the large BOSS and DESI spectroscopic datasets to perform the first homogeneous and continuous mapping of the evolution of stellar population properties of a complete sample of the most massive LRGs ($\log (M_*/\mathrm{M_\odot})&gt; 11.5$) at 0.15 &lt; z &lt; 0.8. By consistently fitting the same spectral indices at all redshifts, we measured trends of [Fe/H], [alpha/Fe], and light-weighted age as a function of redshift. These galaxies exhibit a passive light-weighted age evolution and flat [Fe/H] and [alpha/Fe] trends towards lower redshift, indicating genuinely passive evolution. These trends are robust against the choice of stellar population models and analysis assumptions, and they support the predictions from IllustrisTNG, which predict negligible chemical evolution for the most massive quenched systems at z &lt; 0.8. Our results suggest that, despite nearly 5 Gyr of cosmic time and a 3-4x increase in number density, the stellar population properties of massive quiescent galaxies remain essentially unchanged since z   0.8. This shows a negligible progenitor bias below z   0.8, and a genuinely passive evolution. Newly added systems after $z \sim 0.8$ were already largely quenched and chemically mature, while subsequent evolution was dominated by dry mergers without altering the bulk of the stellar populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The influence of magnetic fields in Cloud-Cloud Collisions</a><span class="id">[2601.09794]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cloud-cloud collisions are expected to trigger star formation by compressing gas into dense, gravitationally unstable regions. However, the role of magnetic fields in this process is unclear. We use SPH to model head-on collisions between two uniform density clouds, each with mass $500 \,$M$_{\odot}$, initial radius 2 pc, and embedded in a uniform magnetic field parallel to the collision velocity. As in the nonmagnetic case, the resulting shock-compressed layer fragments into a network of filaments. If the collision is sufficiently slow, the filaments are dragged into radial orientations by non-homologous gravitational contraction, resulting in a $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphology, which spawns a centrally concentrated monolithic cluster with a broad mass function shaped by competitive accretion and dynamical ejections. If the collision is faster, a $\textit{Spiders Web}$ of intersecting filaments forms, and star-systems condense out in small subclusters, often at the filament intersections; due to their smaller mass reservoirs, and the lower probability of dynamical ejection, the mass function of star-systems formed in these subclusters is narrower. Magnetic fields affect this dichotomy quantitatively by delaying collapse and fragmentation. As a result, the velocity threshold separating $\textit{Hub Filament}$ and $\textit{Spiders Web}$ morphologies is shifted upward in magnetised runs, thereby enlarging the parameter space in which $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies form, and enhancing the likelihood of producing centrally concentrated clusters. Consequently, magnetic fields regulate both the morphology and timing of star formation in cloud-cloud collisions: they broaden filaments, delay the onset of star formation, and promote the formation of $\textit{Hub Filament}$ morphologies, monolithic clusters and high-mass star-systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09796" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HR-GO II: chemical abundances of low-$E$ retrograde dynamically-tagged-groups: Revealing Thamnos as a very metal-poor substructure</a><span class="id">[2601.09796]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Milky Way halo substructures identified in dynamical space are known to suffer from contamination from the Milky Way in-situ stars, which makes their accreted origins uncertain. We present detailed chemical abundances of 35 stars belonging to two sets of dynamically tagged groups, Rg8 and Rg9, to investigate their accreted nature. Both groups are composed of stars with low orbital energy and very retrograde orbits. We find that Rg8 and Rg9 are chemically indistinguishable across all elements, from C to Eu, strongly indicating that they belong to the same structure. The iron-abundance distribution of this low-$E$ retrograde group has a prominent peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-2.1$, revealing that its main population is very metal-poor, and a secondary peak at [Fe/H] $\approx-1.5$, very likely due to contamination from Milky Way in-situ stars. These groups also heavily overlap with the Thamnos substructure in dynamical space, and we thus use them to investigate the chemical properties of Thamnos. The dominant, low-metallicity population provides strong evidence for the ex-situ origin of Thamnos, as well as its very metal-poor nature. We do not see any evidence of an $\alpha$ knee in our sample, which is consistent with previous studies. Comparison with the Cetus-Palca stream in the chemical space shows similar abundance distributions, and thus it suggests that the Thamnos progenitor dwarf galaxy had a truncated star formation history due to its early merger with the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar-wind Fueled Accretion onto Sagittarius A* in the Presence of a Nuclear Star Cluster</a><span class="id">[2601.09799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way's Galactic Center hosts the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), which provides us with a close-up view into supermassive black hole accretion and feedback. Recent works have shown that the winds from $\sim 30$ Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars orbiting Sgr A* at about 4 arcsec are important contributors to feeding the supermassive black hole. A nuclear star cluster (NSC) with a mass of several $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$, of which $10^6 \, \text{M}_\odot$ is within 1 pc, also surrounds Sgr A*. The NSC contributes to the gravitational potential in the Galactic Center, affecting the orbits of the WR stars and their stellar winds. In this work, we examine the effects that the NSC has on the accretion of these stellar winds onto Sgr A* which have previously been neglected. We find that, on the parsec scale, the effect from the gravitational potential of the NSC is negligible on the wind-fed accretion flow, validating the existing simulations used in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Calibrating Mid-Infrared Emission Features As Diagnostics of Star Formation in Infrared-Luminous Galaxies via Radiative Transfer Modeling</a><span class="id">[2601.09810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminous infrared galaxies are key sites of obscured stellar mass assembly at z &gt; 0.5. Their star formation rates (SFRs) are often estimated using the luminosities of the 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, or those of the [Ne II] and [Ne III] fine-structure lines, as they are minimally affected by obscuration. It is uncertain whether the calibration of these features as SFR tracers depends on the starburst bolometric luminosity or the level of Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) activity. We here investigate the relationship between the luminosities of PAH and Neon lines with star formation rate for highly luminous objects using radiative transfer modeling and archival observations of 42 local Ultraluminous (&gt;= 10^12 L_sun) Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs). We find that PAH and [Ne II] features arise mainly in star-forming regions, with small contributions from the AGN or host, but that the [Ne III] line has a mixed contribution from both star formation and AGN activity. We present relations between L_PAH and L_NeII, and both starburst luminosity and SFR. We find relations for lower luminosity (L_IR  = 10^10-10^12 L_sun) systems underestimate the SFRs in local ULIRGs by up to  1 dex. The 6.2 micron and 11.2 micron PAH features, and the [Ne II] line, are thus good tracers of SFR in ULIRGs. We do not find that a more luminous AGN affects the relationship between SFR and PAH or Neon luminosity, but that it can make PAH emission harder to discern. Our results and derived relations are relevant to studies of star-forming and composite galaxies at z &lt; 3 with the James Webb Space Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09843" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The formation of periodic three-body orbits for Newtonian systems</a><span class="id">[2601.09843]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Braids are periodic solutions to the general N-body problem in gravitational dynamics. These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of  9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are Recently Quenched Ellipticals Truly Isolated Centrals?</a><span class="id">[2601.09846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently Quenched Ellipticals (RQEs) provide a valuable test case for disentangling intrinsic and environmental quenching, particularly because they are commonly classified as isolated central galaxies in low-mass halos. However, central/satellite assignments and isolation labels can vary across group catalogs, and such misclassifications can strongly bias physical interpretations. We present a uniform, physically motivated reassessment of the environments of 155 RQEs previously identified as centrals in an SDSS-based group catalog. We construct value-added neighbor catalogs via KD-tree searches and apply consistent thresholds in projected separation and line-of-sight velocity to (i) verify centrality, (ii) quantify isolation using a mass-ratio-based companion criterion, and (iii) identify potential pseudo-centrals via proximity to massive clusters. We find that 132/155 (85.2\%) RQEs remain true centrals, while 23/155 (14.8\%) are better interpreted as misidentified centrals with a more massive neighbor within $R_{\rm proj}\leq0.8$ Mpc and $\Delta V\leq250$ km s$^{-1}$. Among the true centrals, 110/132 (83.3\%) satisfy our isolation criterion, and only one system meets our pseudo-central definition, indicating that direct cluster-scale preprocessing is rare for RQE centrals. Using projected number density and surface stellar mass density, we show that misidentified and non-isolated systems occupy systematically denser regimes than isolated true centrals. These results imply that while most RQEs ($\sim$71\%) are consistent with predominantly internal quenching in genuinely isolated centrals, a non-negligible minority ($\sim$29\%) likely experienced environmentally influenced pathways at group scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond UV: Rest-frame B-band and Apparent Luminosity Functions of z=5-9 Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.09948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new measurements of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) from JWST/NIRCam imaging over the redshift range z=4.5-9.7, using photometric catalogs from JADES and public extragalactic fields. Our analysis includes rest-frame UV and B-band LFs, as well as apparent LFs in F090W, F115W, F200W, F356W, and F444W. We present the first constraints on the rest-frame B-band LF at z 7-8 and extend existing measurements at z 5 to M(B) = -18 mag. The B-band LFs evolve more strongly with redshift than UV LFs, though both decline more gradually than predicted by simulations at z&gt;5. No single existing simulation reproduces all observed trends, with discrepancies likely driven by assumptions about binary evolution and stellar population synthesis models. The apparent LFs in F356W and F444W show hints of a bright-end excess at all redshifts, extending to fainter magnitudes at higher redshift. While extreme emission line galaxies may partially account for it, the excess may also indicate a population of moderately red, optically bright sources - potentially dusty star-forming galaxies or obscured AGNs. Finally, we find that rest-frame B-band luminosity correlates more tightly with stellar mass than UV, making it a powerful tracer of mass assembly and reinforcing the diagnostic value of rest-frame optical LFs in uncovering the physical processes that drive early galaxy formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Caught in Swallowtails: Discovery of Two Swallowtail Image Formations in MS 0451.6-0305</a><span class="id">[2601.10097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of two swallowtail image formations at $z=2.91$ and $z=6.70$ behind the galaxy cluster MS 0451.6-0305 in JWST-NIRCam imaging. We find that in both of the above lensed systems, the complex image morphology cannot be reproduced by simple fold/cusp caustics, and detailed lens modeling reveals higher-order swallowtail caustic configurations. In the $z=2.91$ lens system, a small part of the source galaxy (which itself is part of a galaxy group) containing atleast two compact knots sits inside the swallowtail caustic, producing a quadruply imaged arc. At two of the image positions of these knots, we infer point source magnifications of $\gtrsim 300$, implying lensing-corrected effective radii of $\lesssim 0.8-1.5$ pc. The $z=6.70$ system exhibits even more complex image formation. We therefore only use the most confidently identified counter-images of knots in this system as constraints in our lens modeling. The resulting model predicts magnifications $\sim20-200$ and lensing-corrected effective radii of $\lesssim 0.8-18.5$ pc for various knots. Together, these two systems represent the first example of observations of multiple swallowtail image formations in a single galaxy cluster and demonstrate the ability of swallowtail caustics to magnify individual substructures at sub-parsec scales, from intermediate redshifts to the first billion years of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10099" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using rapid rotators as tracers of multiplicity statistics as a function of stellar density</a><span class="id">[2601.10099]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent works have identified that rapidly rotating stars are predominantly binaries with separations of a few to a few tenths of au. This is a crucial range of separation that is often inaccessible to searches of binary stars, providing a unique opportunity to examine their statistical properties. In particular, we have performed an analysis of rapid rotators in young moving groups. We examined their fraction as a function of the stellar density of the population in which they are found. We find that there is a deficit of rapid rotators in dense clusters such as the Orion Nebula in comparison to the more diffuse parts of the Orion Complex, as intracluster interactions with neighboring stars likely dissolve binaries with intermediate separations before they had a chance to fully form. In contrast, in older populations with an age of $\sim100$ Myr, mass segregation redistributes binaries relative to single stars, thus in such older regions, rapid rotators are predominantly found in the regions of higher stellar density. This work sheds light on both the conditions that lead to the formation of binary stars and their dynamical evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-scale time-series spectroscopy for stellar ages</a><span class="id">[2601.10240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To date, Galactic Astronomy has largely concerned itself with astrophysical processes, and with the locations, space motions and compositions of objects.

The physical processes responsible for jet bending, and their influence on the polarization properties of radio galaxies, remain poorly understood, leading to the question of whether jet properties in bent radio galaxies differ from those in linear radio galaxies. Using a sample of 24 polarized bent radio galaxies, observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 1–2 GHz, we test for correlation of bending angle with polarization parameters measuring Faraday rotation, intrinsic fractional polarization, and Faraday rotation dispersion, used here as a measure of turbulence along the line of sight. We find no statistically significant correlations. At the spatial resolution of our dataset (3–46 kpc, median 18.4 kpc), our results indicate that we are primarily probing larger-scale intracluster medium effects not related to bending angle. The absence of a statistically significant correlation suggests that bent radio galaxies are reliable probes of intracluster magnetic fields, because their intrinsic properties do not appear to introduce systematic biases into measured polarization parameters. We do detect a preference for source magnetic field vectors to align with the direction of jet bending. Finally, we estimate that the POSSUM and SKA surveys will contain $\gtrsim$300 and $\gtrsim$1000 polarized radio galaxies, respectively, providing large future samples with a range of bending angles and similar redshift distribution and number of beams per source as in our sample, enabling our results to be tested with greater statistical power.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Active Galactic Nuclei and STaR fOrmation in Nearby Galaxies (AGNSTRONG).

This study uses both new submillimeter (sub-mm) observations and archival data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope. Our analysis, which includes a correction for jet emission in the sub-mm bands, fitting spectral energy distribution, and analyzing spectra, enables us to derive star-formation rates (SFRs) through various methods. By comparing radio power and SFRs, we select a sub-sample of jetted AGNs of which radio emission is mostly from the jets. We find that jetted AGNs predominantly lie above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies, suggesting a correlation between jet activity and star formation. By comparing dust extinction, we demonstrate that jetted AGNs do not have more dust which is the fuel of both star formation and AGN activity. Therefore, this correlation is more likely to arise from AGN feedback. We also find that the Eddington ratio does not impact the specific SFRs (sSFRs) of our sample. Additionally, for jetted AGNs, stronger radio emission corresponds to higher sSFRs, suggesting that jet emission may promote star formation, i.e., positive feedback. Our results not only shed light on the feedback mechanisms of AGNs but also underscore the complex interplay between black hole activity and star formation in galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of the First Five Carbon-Enhanced Metal-Poor Stars in the LMC</a><span class="id">[2601.10514]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A substantial fraction of metal-poor stars in the local Milky Way halo exhibit large overabundances of carbon.

Whether these stars exist at similar rates in nearby galaxies is a major open question with implications for the environmental dependence of early chemical evolution. Here, we present the discovery of the first five CEMP stars in the Milky Way's largest dwarf companion, the LMC, using SDSS-V spectra from the BOSS instrument. We measure metallicities ranging from [Fe/H] = -2.1 to -3.2 and evolutionary state corrected carbon enhancements of [C/Fe] = +1.2 to +2.4, placing these stars among the most metal-poor and carbon-rich ever identified in the LMC. This discovery demonstrates that CEMP stars do exist in the LMC despite previous null detections, and establishes the foundation for measuring the CEMP occurrence rate in this system. Such measurements will provide critical tests of whether environmental differences affect the formation channels and frequencies of these ancient, carbon-rich stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origins of the UV continuum and Balmer emission lines in Little Red Dots: observational validation of dense gas envelope models enshrouding the AGN</a><span class="id">[2601.10573]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a statistical study on the origins of the UV continuum and narrow/broad emission lines in little red dots (LRDs), a newly discovered class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Leveraging all archived JWST/NIRSpec data, we build a sample of 28 spectroscopically-confirmed LRDs at $5&lt;z_{\rm spec}&lt;7.2$, by requiring broad H$\alpha$ emission, blue UV colors, V-shaped continua, and compact morphologies. We define a control sample of 9 blue, compact, broad-line AGNs without red optical continua (hereafter little blue dots; LBDs), and examine correlations between rest UV and the narrow/broad H$\alpha$ luminosities in these populations. In LRDs, both narrow and broad H$\alpha$ components are tightly correlated with the UV continuum, and the luminosity ratios are consistent with those in young starburst galaxies. In contrast, the UV to broad H$\alpha$ ratios in LBDs closely match local unobscured AGNs and are statistically different from LRDs. The Ly$\alpha$ occurrence rates and strengths do not differ between LRDs and LBDs and are comparable to normal star-forming galaxies. These results are consistent with a scenario where the central BH in LRDs is enshrouded by a dense opaque gas envelope – in this model, the UV continuum as well as narrow and even broad H$\alpha$ emissions are not powered by AGNs but predominantly by young massive stars surrounding the envelope, while the envelope radiates as a $\sim 5000$ K blackbody. As the envelope dissipates, direct AGN emission can emerge, potentially transforming LRDs into LBDs and marking the end of a short-lived phase of rapid black hole growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-fidelity stellar extinction with Gaia and APOGEE – I. The method and a new extinction curve</a><span class="id">[2601.10595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The scarcity of high-fidelity extinction measurements remains a bottleneck in deriving accurate stellar properties from Gaia parallaxes. In this work, we aim to derive precision extinction estimates for APOGEE DR19 stars, establishing a new benchmark for Galactic stellar population studies. We first determine reddening by comparing observed colorsr, etrieved from photometric surveys or standardized synthetic magnitudes from Gaia BP/RP spectra, to intrinsic colors predicted via an XGBoost model. The model is trained on minimally reddened stars to infer intrinsic colors and their associated uncertainties, using APOGEE stellar parameters (Teff, logg, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe]). The derived reddening values are then converted into extinctions using an anchor ratio of A_BP / A_RP = 1.694 +/- 0.004, derived from red-clump-like stars. Here, we provide extinction measurements in 39 filters across 10 photometric systems and introduce a new empirical extinction curve optimized for broadband passbands. Our extinction estimates (Av) outperform existing results (Bayestar19, StarHorse, SEDEX), achieving a typical precision of 0.03 mag in Av. Notably, we identify systematic deviations of up to 30% between monochromatic and passband-integrated extinction ratios at wavelengths greater than 700 nm. This result highlights the necessity of adopting passband-specific coefficients when correcting extinction to derive stellar parameters. As the foundation for a forthcoming series of papers, these benchmark measurements will be used to (1) revise asteroseismic scaling relations, (2) calibrate differential reddening in open clusters, and (3) reconcile heterogeneous dust maps into a unified, all-sky extinction scheme.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10642" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HII regions in NGC 628: the view of two catalogs</a><span class="id">[2601.10642]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study is devoted to comparing the parameters of the interstellar medium of HII regions in the Kongiu and Groves catalogs for the galaxy NGC 628.

These measurements will reach a flux limit of $5\times 10^{-17}\,{\rm erg}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ in the redshift range $0.4&lt;z&lt;1.8$, opening the door to numerous investigations involving galaxy evolution, extending well beyond the mission's core objectives. The achieved H $\alpha$ luminosity depth will lead to a sufficiently high sampling, enabling the reconstruction of the large-scale galaxy environment. We assess the quality of the reconstruction of the galaxy cosmic web environment with the expected spectroscopic dataset in EDFs. The analysis is carried out on the Flagship and GAEA galaxy mock catalogues. The quality of the reconstruction is first evaluated using geometrical and topological statistics measured on the cosmic web, namely the length of filaments, the area of walls, the volume of voids, and its connectivity and multiplicity. We then quantify how accurately gradients in galaxy properties with distance from filaments can be recovered. As expected, the small-scale redshift-space distortions, have a strong impact on filament lengths and connectivity, but can be mitigated by compressing galaxy groups before skeleton extraction. The cosmic web reconstruction is biased when relying solely on H $\alpha$ emitters. This limitation can be mitigated by applying stellar mass weighting during the reconstruction. However, this approach introduces non-trivial biases that need to be accounted for when comparing to theoretical predictions. Redshift uncertainties pose the greatest challenge in recovering the expected dependence of galaxy properties, though the well-established stellar mass transverse gradients towards filaments can still be observed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02476" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple Populations and a CH Star Found in the 300S Globular Cluster Stellar Stream</a><span class="id">[2401.02476]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) display chemical enrichment in a phenomenon called multiple stellar populations (MSPs). While the enrichment mechanism is not fully understood, there is a correlation between a cluster's mass and the fraction of enriched stars found therein. However, present-day GC masses are often smaller than their masses at the time of formation due to dynamical mass loss. In this work, we explore the relationship between mass and MSPs using the stellar stream 300S. We present the chemical abundances of eight red giant branch member stars in 300S with high-resolution spectroscopy from Magellan/MIKE. We identify one enriched star characteristic of MSPs and no detectable metallicity dispersion, confirming that the progenitor of 300S was a globular cluster. The fraction of enriched stars (12.5\%) observed in our 300S stars is less than the 50\% of stars found enriched in Milky Way GCs of comparable present-day mass ($\sim10^{4.5}$\msun). We calculate the mass of 300S's progenitor and compare it to the initial masses of intact GCs, finding that 300S aligns well with the trend between the system mass at formation and enrichment. 300S's progenitor may straddle the critical mass threshold for the formation of MSPs and can therefore serve as a benchmark for the stellar enrichment process. Additionally, we identify a CH star, with high abundances of \textit{s}-process elements, probably accreted from a binary companion. The rarity of such binaries in intact GCs may imply stellar streams permit the survival of binaries that would otherwise be disrupted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</a><span class="id">[2502.07781]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, depending on its width, length, distance, and stellar density. We use an analytic model for the impacts and apply a test statistic to determine whether they are detectable. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity.

We investigate the relative importance of these using the underlying dark matter density field extracted from the Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) suite of constrained cosmological simulations. We define cosmic web environment through both dark matter densities averaged on a scale up to 16 Mpc/h, and through cosmic web location identified by applying DisPerSE to the CSiBORG haloes. We correlate these environmental measures with the properties of observed galaxies in large surveys using optical data (from the NASA-Sloan Atlas) and 21-cm radio data (from ALFALFA). We find statistically significant correlations between environment and colour, neutral hydrogen gas (HI) mass fraction, star formation rate and Sérsic index. Together, these correlations suggest that bluer, star forming, HI rich, and disk-type galaxies tend to reside in lower density areas, further from filaments, while redder, more elliptical galaxies with lower star formation rates tend to be found in higher density areas, closer to filaments. We find analogous trends with the quenching of galaxies, but notably find that the quenching of low mass galaxies has a greater dependence on environment than the quenching of high mass galaxies. We find that the relationship between galaxy properties and the environmental density is stronger than that with distance to filament, suggesting that environmental density has a greater impact on the properties of galaxies than their location within the larger-scale cosmic web.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical Abundances in the Metal-Poor Globular Cluster ESO 280-SC06: A Formerly Massive, Tidally Disrupted Globular Cluster</a><span class="id">[2506.15664]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first high-resolution abundance study of ESO 280-SC06, one of the least luminous and most metal-poor gravitationally bound Milky Way globular clusters. Using Magellan/MIKE spectroscopy for ten stars, we confirm the cluster's low metallicity as [Fe/H] = $-2.54 \pm 0.06$ and the presence of a nitrogen-enhanced star enriched by binary mass transfer. We determine abundances or abundance upper limits for 21 additional elements from the light, alpha, odd-Z, iron peak, and neutron-capture groups for all ten stars. We find no spread in neutron-capture elements, unlike previous trends identified in some metal-poor globular clusters such as M15 and M92. Eight of the ten stars have light-element abundance patterns consistent with second-population globular cluster stars, which is a significantly larger second-population fraction than would be expected from the low present-day mass of $10^{4.1}$ Msun. We estimate the initial mass of the cluster as $10^{5.4 - 5.7}$ Msun based on its orbit in the Milky Way. A preferential loss of first-population stars could explain the high fraction of second-population stars at the present time. Our results emphasize the importance of considering mass loss when studying globular clusters and their enrichment patterns.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angular-momentum pairs in spherical systems: applications to the Galactic centre</a><span class="id">[2507.10551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Consider a system of point masses in a spherical potential. In such systems objects execute planar orbits covering two-dimensional rings or annuli, represented by the angular-momentum vectors, which slowly reorient due to the persistent weak gravitational interaction between different rings. This process, called vector resonant relaxation, is much faster than other processes which change the size/shape of the rings. The interaction is stron9gest between objects with closely aligned angular-momentum vectors. In this paper, we show that nearly parallel angular-momentum vectors may form stable bound pairs in angular-momentum space. We examine the stability of such pairs against an external massive perturber, and determine the critical separation analogous to the Hill radius or tidal radius in the three-body problem, where the angular-momentum pairs are marginally disrupted, as a function of the perturber's mass, the orbital inclination, and the radial distance. Angular-momentum pairs or multiples closer than the critical inclination will remain bound and evolve together in angular-momentum-direction space under any external influence, such as anisotropic density fluctuations, or massive perturbers. This study has applications in various astrophysical contexts, including galactic nuclei, in particular the Milky Way's Galactic centre, globular clusters, or planetary systems. In nuclear star clusters with a central super-massive black hole, we apply this criterion to the disc of young, massive stars, and show that clusters in angular-momentum space may be used to constrain the presence of intermediate-mass black holes or the mass of the nearby gaseous torus.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Nitrogen-rich AGN Powering a Large Ionizing Bubble at z=8.63</a><span class="id">[2508.01372]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the detection of Ly${\alpha}$ in CANUCS-LRD-z8.6, a recently discovered AGN at z = 8.63 by Tripodi et al.

We detect broad Ly${\alpha}$ emission (FWHM $= 1540 \pm 260$ km/s) near the systemic velocity, which suggests a large ionizing bubble considering that the universe is almost fully neutral at the redshift. Through Ly${\alpha}$ line-shape modeling assuming a Stromgren sphere, we find a large bubble radius, $R_b = 1.5^{+0.3}_{-0.2}$ pMpc, and a moderately high Ly${\alpha}$ escape fraction, $f_{esc} = 11 \pm 3$ %. The intrinsic line width is inferred to be broad ($2200 \pm 280$ km/s), likely originating in the broad-line region. Existing data indicate that CANUCS-LRD-z8.6 is within a mild overdensity, $\delta = 1.8^{+3.0}_{-0.6}$, suggesting that other galaxies in its proximity might have contributed to the formation of the bubble. The high N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / C IV${\lambda}$1548 and N IV]${\lambda}$1488 / O III]${\lambda}$1661 line ratios measured in existing NIRSpec/PRISM data indicate nitrogen enrichment in this metal-poor, low-luminosity AGN. The spectroscopic features are overall similar to other nitrogen-rich galaxies discovered in the literature, such as GN-z11 and GHZ2/GLASSz12.

This catalog yields the first radially-resolved 3D velocity dispersion profiles for Sculptor. We confirm mild oblate rotation, with major-axis velocities reaching $\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond 20.0 arcmin. Using a methodology similar to that in the first paper in this series, we solve the Jeans equations in oblate axisymmetric geometry to infer the galaxy's mass profile. Our modeling reveals a significant degeneracy due to the unknown galaxy inclination, which is overlooked under spherical symmetry assumptions. This degeneracy allows acceptable fits across a range of dark matter profiles, from cuspy to cored. While we do not directly constrain the inclination with our Jeans models, higher-order line-of-sight velocity moments provide useful additional constraints: comparisons with scalefree models from de Bruijne et al. (1996) favor highly flattened (more face-on) configurations. Adopting an inclination well consistent with these comparisons ($i = 57.1$ degrees), we find, alongside radial velocity anisotropy, a dark matter density slope of $\Gamma_{\rm dark} = 0.29^{+0.31}_{-0.41}$ within the radial extent of the 3D velocity data, ruling out a cusp with $\Gamma_{\rm dark} \leq -1$ at 99.8% confidence. This confidence increases for lower inclinations and decreases drastically for nearly edge-on configurations. The results qualitatively agree with $\Lambda$CDM, SIDM, and Fuzzy DM scenarios that predict core formation, while our specific measurements provide quantitative constraints on the prescriptions of feedback, cross sections, or particle masses required by these models, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20455" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlackTHUNDER: Shedding light on a dormant and extreme little red dot at z=8.50</a><span class="id">[2509.20455]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent photometric surveys with JWST have revealed a significant population of mysterious objects with red colours, compact morphologies, frequent signs of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, and negligible X-ray emission. These 'Little Red Dots' (LRDs) have been explored through spectral and photometric studies, but their nature is still under debate. As part of the BlackTHUNDER survey, we have observed UNCOVER_20466, one of the most distant LRDs known (z=8.5), with the JWST/NIRSpec IFU. Previous JWST/NIRCam and JWST/NIRSpec MSA observations of this source revealed its LRD nature, as well as the presence of an AGN. Using our NIRSpec IFU data, we confirm that UNCOVER_20466 is an LRD (based on spectral slopes and compactness) that contains an overmassive black hole. However, our observed Balmer decrements do not suggest strong dust attenuation, resulting in a lower Hbeta-based bolometric luminosity and Eddington luminosity ( 10%) than previously found. This source lies on local relations between M_BH-sigma_* and M_BH-M_Dyn, suggesting that this could be a progenitor of the core of a lower-redshift galaxy. We explore the possible evolution of this source, finding evidence for substantial black hole accretion in the past and a likely origin as a heavy seed at high redshift ( 10^3Msol). Lyman-alpha emission is strongly detected, implying f_esc,Lya 30%. The extremely high [OIII]4363/Hgamma ratio is indicative of not only AGN photoionization and heating, but also extremely high densities (ne 10^7cm-3), suggesting that this black hole at such high redshift may be forming in an ultra-dense protogalaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Star Formation Main Sequence down to 10$^{7} M_\odot$ at $1 &lt; z &lt; 9$</a><span class="id">[2509.22871]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies (SFGMS or MS) is a fundamental scaling relation that provides a global framework for studying galaxy formation and evolution, as well as insight into the complex star formation histories (SFHs) of individual galaxies. In this work, we combine large-area pre-JWST surveys (COSMOS2020, CANDELS), which probe high-$M_\star$ sources (${&gt;10^9\,M_\odot}$), with SHARDS/CANDELS FAINT and JWST data from CANUCS, CEERS, JADES, and UNCOVER, to obtain a high-$z$, star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass ($M_\star$) complete sample spanning both high- and low-$M_\star$ regimes. Completeness in both $M_\star$ and SFR is key to avoiding biases introduced by low-mass, highly star-forming objects. Our combined data set is 80% complete down to $10^{7.6}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim1$ ($10^{8.8}\,M_\odot$ at $z\sim9$). The overall intrinsic MS slope (based on the SFR$_{100}$ and $M_\star$ derived with Dense Basis and nonparametric SFHs) shows little evolution up to $z\sim5$, with values $\sim0.7 - 0.8$. The slope in the low-$M_\star$ regime becomes steeper than that in the high-$M_\star$ end at least up to $z\sim5$, but the strength of this change is highly dependent on the assumptions made on the symmetry of the uncertainties in $M_\star$ and SFR. If real, the steepening suggests reduced star formation efficiency or declining gas content with decreasing $M_\star$. The transition between the low-$M_\star$ regime and the canonical MS occurs around $10^{9.5}\,M_\odot$, independent of $z$. This critical value may coincide with the assembly of galaxies' disks, which can provide a mechanism for self-regulation that stabilizes them against feedback. The intrinsic scatter is compatible with canonical estimates, also at low-$M_\star$, ranging from $0.2-0.3$ dex. This is indicative of rapid variations in star formation being averaged out over $\lesssim100$ Myr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Classical Cepheids in the Galactic thin disk I.

We present a homogeneous, NLTE spectroscopic analysis of 401 Galactic CCs, based on 1,351 high-resolution optical spectra, spanning Galactocentric distances from 4.6 to 29.3 kpc. Using PySME with MARCS atmospheres and state-of-the-art grids of NLTE departure coefficients, we derive atmospheric parameters and abundances for key species tracing multiple nucleosynthetic channels. Our sample-the largest CC NLTE dataset to date-achieves high internal precision and enables robust modeling of present-day thin-disk abundance patterns and radial gradients. We estimate abundance gradients using three analytic prescriptions (linear, logarithmic, bilinear with a break) within a Bayesian, outlier-robust framework, and we also apply Gaussian Process Regression to capture non-parametric variations. We find that NLTE atmospheric parameters differ systematically from LTE determinations. Moreover, iron and most elemental abundance profiles are better described by non-linear behavior rather than by single-slope linear models: logarithmic fits generally outperform simple linear models, while bilinear fits yield inconsistent break radii across elements. Gaussian Process models reveal a consistent outer-disk flattening of [X/H] for nearly all studied elements. The [X/Fe] ratios are largely flat with Galactocentric radius, indicating coherent chemical scaling with iron across the thin disk, with modest positive offsets for Na and Al and mild declines for Mn and Cu. Comparison with recent literature shows overall agreement but highlights NLTE-driven differences, especially in outer-disk abundances. These results provide tighter empirical constraints for chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way and set the stage for future NLTE mapping with upcoming large spectroscopic surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Tale of Two Dust Disks in Our Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2601.02724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic dust plays a vital role in stellar and galactic formation and evolution, but its three-dimensional structure in the Milky Way has remained unclear due to insufficient precise reddening and distance measurements.

To ensure that such signals, expected to be exceedingly weak, can be detected in the ongoing O4 observing run by coherent integration over years, simulated waveforms ('hardware injections') are injected directly into the LIGO data by continuously modulating the positions of the interferometer mirrors so as to mimic nearly sinusoidal signals from fast-spinning galactic neutron stars. A set of 18 such simulated CW sources are injected with signal frequencies spanning much of the LIGO detection band and with varying sky locations. By verifying the successful recovery of the simulated signals, including preservation of absolute phase over as many as 10^{11} signal cycles, we validate our understanding of detector response and end-to-end search pipelines, including data cleaning. Daily and weekly monitoring of the signal reconstruction is meant to catch any unexpected sudden changes in interferometer response, to verify that signal-to-noise ratio increases as expected and to verify that simulated source parameters are recovered correctly. We describe three methods of monitoring: 1) a highly templated matched filter to extract signal amplitude and phase precisely; 2) a frequentist Fstatistic evaluation that marginalizes over amplitude, phase and orientation of the star; and 3) a Bayesian reconstruction of the source parameters together with noise characterization. Results from each method are shown, with emphasis on the new templated method, which yields precise measurement of the critical phase offset parameter and therefore validates understanding of absolute timing delays in the detector response and data stream.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Understanding Means in AI-Laden Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2601.10038]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Artificial intelligence is rapidly transforming astronomical research, yet the scientific community has largely treated this transformation as an engineering challenge rather than an epistemological one. This perspective article argues that philosophy of science offers essential tools for navigating AI's integration into astronomy–conceptual clarity about what &quot;understanding&quot; means, critical examination of assumptions about data and discovery, and frameworks for evaluating AI's roles across different research contexts. Drawing on an interdisciplinary workshop convening astronomers, philosophers, and computer scientists, we identify several tensions. First, the narrative that AI will &quot;derive fundamental physics&quot; from data misconstrues contemporary astronomy as equation-derivation rather than the observation-driven enterprise it is. Second, scientific understanding involves more than prediction–it requires narrative construction, contextual judgment, and communicative achievement that current AI architectures struggle to provide. Third, because narrative and judgment matter, human peer review remains essential–yet AI-generated content flooding the literature threatens our capacity to identify genuine insight. Fourth, while AI excels at well-defined problem-solving, the ill-defined problem-finding that drives breakthroughs appears to require capacities beyond pattern recognition. Fifth, as AI accelerates what is feasible, pursuitworthiness criteria risk shifting toward what AI makes easy rather than what is genuinely important. We propose &quot;pragmatic understanding&quot; as a framework for integration–recognizing AI as a tool that extends human cognition while requiring new norms for validation and epistemic evaluation. Engaging with these questions now may help the community shape the transformation rather than merely react to it.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASTRA: A Python Package for Cross-Instrument Stellar and Telluric Template Construction</a><span class="id">[2601.10439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>ASTRA is a Python package that provides a modular, instrument-independent interface for working with high-resolution stellar spectra.

Rubin Observatory, through its Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will soon start producing 10 million alerts on transient astronomical objects per night. Due to logistics and bandwidth, alerts will not be dispatched directly to the public but to 'brokers' i.e. tools selected by LSST to handle alert streams. Brokers offer both common, specific and micro-specific functionalities related to alert handling, analysis, representation and dissemination. In this ecosystem, potentially augmented by data streams from other astronomical sources, there is a - need demonstrated by the community - for use cases which combine features of individual brokers. In this paper we present initial efforts and a prototype of such a tool, along with a language that would allow users to define use cases / workflows in a manner tailored for the domain.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DC response of an interferometer topology with an L-shaped cavity: a tabletop study</a><span class="id">[2601.09764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A new interferometer topology for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection was recently proposed in [Zhang et al. Phys. Rev. X 13, 021019 (2023)]. The design is based on an L-shaped optical cavity pumped through a Sagnac-like vortex. We report a tabletop experiment that characterizes the interferometer's optical response near DC. When the laser frequency is locked to the resonance of the L-shaped cavity, we observe that the cavity input coupler becomes effectively transparent, yielding a simple Michelson-like response. Moreover, the Sagnac vortex separates into upper and lower paths, which behave as two independent pumping paths driving the cavity. These observations are in agreement with theoretical predictions. Our results provide an intuitive physical picture of this interferometer topology and offer insight into its lock acquisition strategy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Limits of Habitability: A Catalog of Rocky Exoplanets in the Habitable Zone</a><span class="id">[2501.14054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While most of the 6000 discovered exoplanets are highly unlike the Earth, the first rocky worlds in the Habitable Zone (HZ) provide intriguing targets for the search for life in the cosmos. As detections increase, it is critical to test the empirical HZ as well as its limits using known exoplanets. However, there is not yet a list of rocky worlds that observers can use to test the limits of surface habitability. We analysed data from Gaia DR3 and the NASA Exoplanet Archive (NEA) of all known exoplanets, identifying future targets to test limits of habitability through i) orbits near the edges of the HZ, ii) similar irradiation environments to modern Earth, and iii) large eccentricities. We prioritize targets for transmission observations, light curve measurements, and direct imaging, identify the oldest HZ rocky worlds based on the NEA and complementary literature data, and provide theoretical limits for the empirical HZ and a 3D-HZ for each system. Our analysis shows 45 rocky worlds in the empirical HZ and 24 in a narrower 3D-HZ. For context, we compare their demographics to those of the full catalog of exoplanets in the NEA. The resulting list of rocky exoplanet targets in the HZ will allow observers to shape and optimize search strategies with space- and ground-based telescopes – such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), and LIFE – and design new observing strategies and instruments to explore these worlds, addressing the question of the limits of exoplanet surface habitability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red noise-based false alarm thresholds for astrophysical periodograms via Whittle's approximation to the likelihood</a><span class="id">[2512.18205]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astronomers who search for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle periodograms rely on false alarm level (FAL) estimates to identify statistically significant peaks. Although FALs are often calculated from white noise models, many astronomical time series suffer from red noise. Prewhitening is a statistical technique in which a continuum model is subtracted from log power spectrum estimate, after which the observer can proceed with a white-noise treatment. Here we present a prewhitening-based method of calculating frequency-dependent FALs. We fit power laws and autoregressive models of order 1 to each Lomb-Scargle periodogram by minimizing the Whittle approximation to the negative log-likelihood (NLL), then calculate FALs based on the best-fit model power spectrum. Our technique is a novel extension of the Whittle NLL to datasets with uneven time sampling. We demonstrate FAL calculations using observations of $\alpha$ Cen B, GJ 581, HD 192310, synthetic data from the radial velocity (RV) Fitting Challenge, and {\it Kepler} observations of a differential rotator. The {\it Kepler} data analysis shows that only true rotation signals are detected by red-noise FALs, while white-noise FALs suggest all spurious peaks in the low-frequency range are significant. A high-frequency sinusoid injected into $\alpha$ Cen B $\log R^{\prime}_{HK}$ observations exceeds the 1\% red-noise FAL despite having only 8.9\% of the power of the dominant rotation signal. In a periodogram of HD 192310 RVs, peaks associated with differential rotation and planets are detected against the 5\% red-noise FAL without iterative model fitting or subtraction. Software for calculating red noise-based FALs is available on GitHub.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superconducting Ring Resonators: Modelling, Simulation, and Experimental Characterisation</a><span class="id">[2506.23811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a theoretical and experimental study of superconducting ring resonators as an initial step toward their implementation in superconducting electronics and quantum technologies, with promising applications including superconducting parametric amplifiers with pump-signal isolation, flux-controlled quantum circuits, ultra-sensitive measurements in quantum sensing, and THz instrumentations. These devices have the potentially valuable property of supporting two orthogonal electromagnetic modes that couple to a common Cooper pair, quasiparticle, and phonon system. We present here a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the superconducting ring resonator system. We have developed superconducting ring resonator models that describe the key features of microwave behaviour to first order, providing insights into how transmission line inhomogeneities give rise to frequency splitting and mode rotation. Furthermore, we constructed signal flow graphs for a four-port ring resonator to numerically validate the behaviour predicted by our theoretical analysis. Superconducting ring resonators were fabricated in both coplanar waveguide and microstrip geometries using Al and Nb thin films. Microwave characterisation of these devices demonstrates close agreement with theoretical predictions. Our study reveals that frequency splitting and mode rotation are prevalent in ring systems with coupled degenerate modes, and these phenomena become distinctly resolved in high quality factor superconducting ring resonators.</p></div></details></article></body>
