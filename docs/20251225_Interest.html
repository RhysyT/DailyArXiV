They constitute a large, multi-layered ecosystem connecting universities, national laboratories, non profit organizations, and grassroots community groups. Despite the growing importance of these programs, and the frequency that they undergo self-evaluation, little systematic information exists on best practices or common approaches to evaluating the effectiveness of STEM outreach initiatives. To address this gap, we integrated literature review with email inquiries about self evaluation tools sent to Canadian STEM outreach programs funded by NSERC (Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada) PromoScience grants. We contacted 200 programs and heard back from about 100 of them, for a response rate of 50%. Of those respondents, 68 shared information about a formal self-evaluation tool appropriate for general STEM outreach. The results led us to develop a toolbox of self-evaluation methods, master question banks and starting-point templates for student/participant and teacher/chaperone surveys, and a synthesized list of recommendations for evaluation process, design, and implementation. Our approach provides a broad treatment of how to do STEM outreach evaluation, supplementing the relevant literature, where large-N studies and Canadian studies are relatively rare. We acknowledge that some of the most effective practices in STEM outreach evaluation require resources or capacity (e.g. longitudinal approaches), which may be limited for many outreach practitioners, but others seem to have a high ratio of benefit to cost (e.g. adding qualitative questions to an otherwise quantitative survey).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Benefits and Challenges of a Quantum Computing Concept Inventory</a><span class="id">[2512.20836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A Quantum Computing Concept Inventory is needed for the acceleration of uptake of best practice in quantum computing education required to support the quantum computing workforce for the next two decades. Eight experts in quantum computing, quantum ommunication or quantum sensing were interviewed to determine if there is substantial non-mathematical content to warrant such an inventory and determine a preliminary list of key concepts that should be included in such an inventory. Developing such an inventory is a challenging task requiring significant international 'buy-in' and creativity to produce jargon-free valid questions which are accessible to students who are yet to study quantum mechanics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16308" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamiltonian dynamics of classical spins</a><span class="id">[2503.16308]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss the geometry behind classical Heisenberg model at the level suitable for third or fourth year students who did not have the opportunity to take a course on differential geometry. The arguments presented here rely solely on elementary algebraic concepts such as vectors, dual vectors and tensors, as well as Hamiltonian equations and Poisson brackets in their simplest form. We derive Poisson brackets for classical spins, along with the corresponding equations of motion for classical Heisenberg model, starting from the geometry of two-sphere, thereby demonstrating the relevance of standard canonical procedure in the case of Heisenberg model.</p></div></details></article></body>
