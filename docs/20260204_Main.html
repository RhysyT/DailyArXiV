II. Self-gravitating Baryonic Matter</a><span class="id">[2602.02507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GenASiS (General Astrophysical Simulation System) is a code being developed initially and primarily, though not exclusively, for the simulation of core-collapse supernovae on the world's leading capability supercomputers. This paper – the second in a series – documents capabilities for Newtonian self-gravitating fluid dynamics, including tabulated microphysical equations of state treating nuclei and nuclear matter (`baryonic matter'). Computation of the gravitational potential of a spheroid, and simulation of the gravitational collapse of dust and of an ideal fluid, provide tests of self-gravitation against known solutions. In multidimensional computations of the adiabatic collapse, bounce, and explosion of spherically symmetric pre-supernova progenitors – which we propose become a standard benchmark for code comparisons – we find that the explosions are prompt and remain spherically symmetric (as expected), with an average shock expansion speed and total kinetic energy that are inversely correlated with the progenitor mass at the onset of collapse and the compactness parameter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02575" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation and Evolution of Antimatter Objects</a><span class="id">[2602.02575]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fundamental question of baryogenesis and the problem of matter-antimatter asymmetry motivate this study into the formation and evolution of antimatter objects in the early Universe. Hypothesize is the existence of isolated antimatter domains in a baryon-asymmetric Universe that survive until the era of first star formation ($Z \approx 20$). By assuming CPT-symmetry, the thermodynamics, mechanics, and energy dynamics of an antimatter gas cloud (composed of antihydrogen and antihelium) are treated symmetrically to their primordial matter counterparts. Analysis demonstrates the physical feasibility of the gravitational collapse process for a conservatively estimated antimatter domain ($\approx 5 \times 10^3 M_{\odot}$). The initial conditions easily satisfy the Jeans and Bonnor-Ebert mass criteria, indicating a high propensity for instability and runaway collapse. The subsequent dynamical evolution, driven by $\bar{H}_2$ cooling, is predicted to proceed identically to that of Population III star formation, leading to the formation of a dense, adiabatic anti-protostellar core. The theoretical viability of a true antistar hinges upon a critical assumption: the physical possibility of antinuclear fusion (e.g., the antiproton cycle) under extreme core conditions. Assuming this symmetry holds, the collapse is predicted to yield massive antistars ($\gtrsim 22 M_{\odot}$). This suggests that if antimatter domains formed in the early Universe, they likely underwent stellar formation. Observational constraints on the existence of these objects must rely on the detection of characteristic high-energy $\gamma$-ray or X-ray signals resulting from matter-antimatter annihilation at the domain boundaries or during mass accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-Singular Bouncing cosmology from Phantom Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Coupling: Reconstruction with Observational Insights</a><span class="id">[2602.02608]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine non-singular bounce cosmology within the framework of a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term in both non-viscous and bulk-viscous cases. Using the scale factor ansatz $\alpha(t)=\left(\frac{\alpha}{\eta}+t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2 \eta}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $\chi_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours. Our findings suggest that bounce cosmologies could offer a physically reasonable and observationally acceptable alternative or pre-inflationary scenario, while highlighting the role that viscosity could play for a stable and smooth cosmological evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Saturn's Evolutionary History and Seismology: Survival of Deep Stably Stratified Regions in Evolutionary Models of Saturn Consistent with Ring Seismology</a><span class="id">[2602.02647]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With recent advances in the modeling of the solar system giant planets, rapid progress has been made in understanding the remaining questions pertaining to their formation and evolution. However, this progress has largely neglected the significant constraints on the interior of Saturn's structure imposed by the observed oscillation frequencies in its rings. Here, we study initial conditions for Saturn's evolution that, after $4.56\;\mathrm{Gyr}$ of evolution, give rise to planetary structures admitting oscillation frequencies consistent with those observed via Saturn's ring seismology. Restricting our attention to models without compact rocky cores, we achieve simultaneous good agreement with most observed properties of Saturn at the level of current evolutionary models and with key frequencies in the observed oscillation spectrum. Our preliminary work suggests that Saturn's interior stably stratified region may be moderately less extended ($\sim 0.4$–$0.5R_{\rm Sat}$) than previously thought, which is important for reconciling the seismic constraints with evolutionary models. We also tentatively find that the deep helium gradients inferred by previous, static structural modelling of Saturn's ring seismology may not be required to reproduce the observed seismology data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02651" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-Wave Signals for Supernova Explosions of Three-Dimensional Progenitors</a><span class="id">[2602.02651]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae (SNe) are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) produced by hydrodynamical instabilities and highly time-dependent anisotropies of the neutrino radiation. In this work we analyze both contributions to the GW signal for two state-of-the-art three-dimensional (3D) SN models computed with the Prometheus-Vertex neutrino-hydrodynamics code. In contrast to the far majority of models analyzed for GWs so far, our core-collapse simulations were started with 12.28 M_sun (18.88 M_sun) progenitors, whose final hour (7 min) of convective oxygen-shell burning was computed in 3D and featured a vigorous oxygen-neon shell merger. The corresponding large-scale asymmetries in the oxygen layer are conducive to buoyancy-aided neutrino-driven explosions. The models were continuously evolved in 3D from the pre-collapse evolution until 5.11 s (1.68 s) after the core bounce. The GW signals result from the well-known dynamical phenomena in the SN core such as prompt postshock convection, neutrino-driven convection, the standing accretion shock instability, proto-neutron star oscillations, and anisotropic ejecta expansion. They do not exhibit any new or specific features that can be unambiguously connected to the powerful pre-collapse activity in the progenitors, but we identify interesting differences compared to results in the literature. We also discuss measurement prospects by interferometers, confirming that GW signals from future Galactic SNe will be detectable with existing and next-generation experiments working in the frequency range f   1-2000 Hz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-hydrodynamics of star-disc collisions for quasi-periodic eruptions</a><span class="id">[2602.02656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are recently discovered transients of unknown nature occurring near supermassive black holes, which feature bright X-ray bursts separated by hours to days. A promising model for QPEs is the star-disc collisions model, where a star repeatedly interacts with an accretion disc around a black hole, creating shocks that expel dense outflows of gas from which radiation emerges. We investigate the dynamics of the star-disc collisions, the properties of the outflows, and the resulting radiation signatures. Our study focuses on the generic case where the star remains unperturbed by the collision and the stellar crossing time through the disc is sufficiently long for shocked gas to flow around the star. We performed a three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the star-disc collision. The star was modeled as a solid, spherical body, and the interaction was simulated for a small, local section of the accretion disc. We found that star-disc collisions generate a nearly paraboloidal bow shock. The heating of gas is not confined to the column of gas directly ahead of the star but also extends laterally as the shock front expands sideways while traveling with the star. As the star crosses the disc, it injects momentum preferentially along its direction of motion, leading to an asymmetric redistribution of energy and momentum. As a result, two outflows emerge on opposite sides of the disc with different properties: the forward outflow expands faster, contains more mass, carries more energy, and is about twice as luminous as the backward outflow. Our findings suggest that the asymmetry in outflow properties and luminosity arises naturally from the collision dynamics, offering a possible explanation for the alternating strong-weak flare patterns observed in several QPE sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02667" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probabilistic inference in very large universes</a><span class="id">[2602.02667]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[Abridged] Some cosmological theories propose that the observable universe is a small part of a much larger universe in which parameters describing the low-energy laws of physics vary from region to region. How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for &quot;first-person&quot; probabilities – i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant – an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings – i.e., her &quot;subjective state&quot;. We advocate a &quot;Principle of Self-Locating Indifference&quot; (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of &quot;old evidence&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lightcurve Modelling of 2,205 ZTF DR2 Type Ia Supernovae: Implications for SN Ia Physics and Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2602.02677]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We fit the multi-band light curves of 2,205 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) from the Zwicky Transient Facility DR2 with a one-zone radioactive decay model with a phenomenological addition to include Fe recombination physics. We find a strong correlation between inferred nickel mass and SALT2 stretch, which within our simplified modelling is linked to larger ejecta masses providing longer diffusion times, providing a physical basis for the brighter-slower relation. SN Ia in low-mass hosts ($\log_{10}(M_*/M_\odot) &lt; 10$) produce $12\%$ more $^{56}$Ni than those in high-mass hosts ($\Delta M_{\rm Ni} = 0.13~M_\odot$), linking the host-galaxy mass step to ejecta properties and hinting at metallicity or age-dependent burning efficiencies. This suggests that standardisation based on physical parameters may remove the mass-step. SN 1991T-like events show higher ejecta masses (median $1.64~M_\odot$ vs. $1.38~M_\odot$ for normals) and produce $30\%$ more $^{56}$Ni, with $84\%$ having super-Chandrasekhar masses. Through Hierarchical modelling of $902$ SNe ($z \leq 0.06$), we find thermonuclear supernovae can be well described by a Gaussian distribution in ejecta mass and nickel mass with $\mu_{\rm ej} = 1.26 \pm 0.01~M_\odot$ ($\sigma_{\rm ej} = 0.33 \pm 0.01~M_\odot$) and $\mu_{\rm Ni} = 0.64 \pm 0.06~M_\odot$ ($\sigma_{\rm Ni} = 0.42 \pm 0.02~M_\odot$), respectively. This leads to inferred fractions of $43 \pm 2\%$ sub-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($&lt;1.2~M_\odot$), $34 \pm 1\%$ near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($1.2$–$1.5~M_\odot$), and $24 \pm 2\%$ super-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ($&gt;1.5~M_\odot$) events. This work provides a step towards holistic physical characterization of the local SN Ia population, reinforcing the physical basis of SN Ia standardization while quantifying diversity and environmental dependencies critical for understanding progenitor physics and mitigating systematics in precision cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02691" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An infrared echo from a circumstellar disk in the hydrogen- and helium-poor SN 2024aecx</a><span class="id">[2602.02691]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of the hydrogen- and helium-poor (Type Ic) supernova (SN) 2024aecx that displays a strong NIR excess emerging 32 days post peak. SN 2024aecx is a peculiar SN Ic that exhibited luminous shock-cooling emission at early times, suggestive of close-in circumstellar medium (CSM), unexpected for this class of SNe. Its early NIR spectra are typical for a SN Ic but with strong CI absorption features. By  32 days post peak, the spectra show a strong NIR excess, while maintaining normal optical colors, unprecedented for SNe Ic. We find that the NIR excess is well fit with a single-temperature, optically thin dust model with declining temperature, increasing mass, and roughly constant luminosity over time. The NIR excess appears too promptly for dust to have formed in the SN ejecta, indicating an IR echo from pre-existing dust in the CSM. The IR echo is likely powered by the relatively slowly evolving SN peak light, and not the brief shock cooling emission, as the latter requires unrealistically high CSM densities to explain the observed dust mass. We consider different potential CSM geometries and find that a thick face-on disk with an inner edge around $5\times 10^{16}$ cm can best explain the dust mass and temperature evolution. In this scenario, the SN shock should start interacting with this CSM $440\pm200$ days post explosion. CSM around SN Ic is rare, and follow-up observations of SN 2024aecx will probe the mass-loss process responsible for removing hydrogen and helium from their progenitor star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Degeneracies and modelling choices in double-plane time-delay cosmography</a><span class="id">[2602.02697]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Double-plane gravitational lensing is a rare but increasingly observed phenomenon in which the light from a distant source is lensed by two foreground objects at different redshifts. Such systems can be used to provide simultaneous constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the dark-energy equation of state, independent of and complementary to other probes. However, just as for single-plane gravitational lenses, the precision of these constraints is limited by the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) – a fundamental limit to the knowledge of the mass profiles of lens galaxies and the line of sight that can be obtained from imaging constraints alone. In this work, we show explicitly how contributions from the line of sight appear in double-plane systems. Because these contributions modify angular diameter distances, we argue that cosmological priors should not be used to simply fix the “cosmological scaling factor”, a ratio of angular diameter distances which is key to the modelling of double-plane lenses. Motivated by this fact, we generalise the double-plane MSD to account for this uncertainty in the scaling factor. While this complicates the time-delay function, we show that, using the “unfolding relation”, a geometric relation between distances which holds even in the presence of line-of-sight corrections, the uncertainty in the Hubble constant reduces to the familiar mass-sheet transformation of the first lens plane, and a line-of-sight contribution between the observer and the second lens plane. Our main message is therefore a prescription for reducing the degrees of freedom within double-plane models, while still safely accounting for the MSD in measurements of $H_0$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyclotron lines in subcritical X-ray pulsars: Monte Carlo simulations reveal the origin of the observed variability</a><span class="id">[2602.02733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observed cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) in X-ray pulsars (XRPs) exhibit strong variability. In the subcritical luminosity regime, the centroid energy ($E_{CRSF}$) and line width ($\sigma_{CRSF}$) often show positive correlations with the X-ray luminosity. We investigate the physical origin of the observed variability quantitatively, focusing on the effects of resonant scattering and Doppler shift induced by the plasma flow in the accretion funnel. We developed a relativistic Monte Carlo code to perform detailed radiative transfer calculations in the accretion funnel above the hotspot and derive angle-dependent spectra. Analytical plasma density and velocity profiles were adopted to account for the effects of radiation pressure on the flow. Approximate resonant scattering cross-sections were employed. We varied the accretion luminosity to explore the resulting variability of the CRSF properties. The emergent spectra exhibit a prominent, asymmetric CRSF accompanied by a broad blue wing. The CRSF is systematically redshifted relative to the classical cyclotron energy, with the magnitude of the redshift decreasing at higher luminosities and for larger viewing angles $\theta$. Both $E_{CRSF}$ and $\sigma_{CRSF}$ correlate positively with luminosity for all viewing angles. Their absolute values, however, depend strongly on the viewing angle, indicating substantial variability over the pulse cycle and sensitivity to the system geometry. At fixed luminosity, $E_{CRSF}$ ($\sigma_{CRSF}$) decreases (increases) with increasing $\cos\theta$. Consequently, phase-resolved observations are expected to reveal an anticorrelation between the CRSF centroid energy and width. When applied to the XRP GX 304$-$1, the model reproduces the observed CRSF variability over nearly an order of magnitude in luminosity for geometries in which the accretion funnel is predominantly viewed edge-on.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Lag between Accretion and Wind Events in the T Tauri Star RY Tau</a><span class="id">[2602.02772]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The results of spectroscopic and photometric monitoring of the classical T Tauri star RY Tau are presented. The observation series span 220 nights from 2013 to 2024. During the observation period, the star's brightness varied within the range of V=9-11 mag. The rotation axis of the &quot;star + accretion disk&quot; system is tilted at a large angle, so the line of sight intersects the wind region and accreting flows in the star's magnetosphere. Variability in the short-wavelength wing of the Halpha emission line and the profile of the D NaI resonance doublet are analyzed. It is shown that the wind and accretion flows vary on a time scale of approximately 20 days. When the predominant flow direction changes, a time lag is observed: initially, accretion increases, and after two days, absorption in the line-of-sight wind decreases. It is concluded that the spectral line profiles are formed in the magnetospheric accretion flows and the conical wind originating from the boundary of the star's magnetosphere. The time lag is determined by the tilt of the magnetic dipole and the opening angle of the conical wind. It is assumed that RY Tau operates in an unstable propeller mode, and fluctuations in the accretion and wind flows are caused by density waves in the accretion disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02836" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unraveling the Brown Dwarf Desert: Four New Discoveries and a Unifying, Period-Coded Picture</a><span class="id">[2602.02836]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present four newly validated transiting brown dwarfs identified through TESS photometry and confirmed with high-precision radial velocity measurements obtained from the FEROS and PLATOSpec spectrographs. Notably, three of these companions exhibit orbital periods exceeding 100 days, thereby expanding the sample of long-period transiting brown dwarfs from two to five systems. The host stars of long-period brown dwarfs show mild subsolar metallicity. These discoveries highlight the expansion of the metal-poor, long-period distribution and help us better understand the brown dwarf desert. In our comparative analysis of eccentricity and metallicity demographics, we utilize catalogues of long-period giant planets, brown dwarfs, and low-mass stellar companions. After accounting for tidal influences, the eccentricity distribution aligns with that of low-mass stellar binaries, presenting a different profile than that observed within the giant planet population. Additionally, the metallicity of the host stars reveals a noteworthy trend: short-period transiting brown dwarfs are predominantly associated with metal-rich stars, whereas long-period brown dwarfs are more often found around metal-poor stars, demonstrating statistical similarities to low-mass stellar hosts. This trend has also been previously observed in studies of hot and cold Jupiters and points to a period-coded mixture of channels. A natural explanation is that most brown dwarfs originate from fragmentation at wider separations, with long-period systems retaining this stellar-like imprint, while only those embedded in massive, long-lived, metal-rich protoplanetary discs are efficiently delivered and stabilised to short orbits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02845" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres at high spectral resolution</a><span class="id">[2602.02845]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of ultra-hot Jupiters offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the physics of some of the most extreme planetary atmospheres known. With exceedingly high amounts of irradiation blasting their upper atmospheres, ultra-hot Jupiters have dayside temperatures comparable to some late type stars enabling refractory metals otherwise condensed in colder planets to exist in the gas phase, all the while still maintaining comparatively cool nightsides. The ensuing intense temperature contrasts can give rise not only to strong day-to-night winds, but also to vastly different chemical and cloud properties on opposing hemispheres. With its ability to resolve spectral features that are unique to individual chemical species, high resolution spectroscopy can unambiguously disentangle atmospheric signals of exoplanetary origin, which follow a well-defined Keplerian motion, from stationary or pseudo-stationary telluric and stellar lines. Combined, the high temperature of ultra-hot Jupiters providing access to refractory metals with narrow spectral features and the ability of high-resolution spectroscopy to resolve said narrow lines provides access to a wealth of information about these atmospheres that would otherwise be unavailable at lower resolving powers or for other types of planets. In this chapter we explore some of the key physical and chemical transitions that differentiate ultra-hot Jupiters from their colder counterparts and highlight the unique opportunities arising from probing their atmospheres using high resolution spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ca ii 854.2 nm in an enhanced network region simulated with MURaM-ChE</a><span class="id">[2602.02851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Ca ii 854.2 nm line is widely used to study the chromosphere of the Sun. In the quiet Sun, the spatially averaged line profile shows a red asymmetry and a redshift of the line center. It is known that the effect of isotopic splitting must be taken into account in the forward modeling to reproduce the observed asymmetry. So far, no numerical model could match an average observed line profile in terms of the line width and asymmetry. Our goal is to investigate how well a simulation computed with the chromospheric extension of the MURaM code (MURaM-ChE) reproduces the spatially averaged Ca ii 854.2 nm line profile. We aim to determine the contributions from the isotopic splitting versus the dynamics in the atmosphere to the resulting line width and asymmetry. We solve the radiative transfer problem three times, once considering only the most abundant isotope of calcium in the atmosphere, once taking six calcium isotopes into account, and finally using a single composite atom model. We find the forward modeled spatially and temporally averaged spectra to be in good agreement with an average observation of the quiet Sun. In order to match the observed line width, the simulated atmosphere must be sufficiently dynamic. The typical red asymmetry can only be reproduced by taking the isotopic splitting effect into account, as suggested in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing beyond the Standard Model with gravitational waves from phase transitions</a><span class="id">[2602.02861]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This review article is based on a seminar presented at the Higgs pairs workshop 2025.

We use two different inversion methodologies and a model of the tachocline to derive its position, width and the amplitude of the radial shear. To validate our methodology we present results from simulated rotational splittings, whether including or not random noise commensurable with the current observational precision. We also describe how we leverage the fact that one of our methodologies uses an initial guess that can be chosen to include a priori information. In order to try to resolve the tachocline, we increased the radial density of the inversion grid and showed how it affect the inferences. We also show how the trade off between smoothing and noise magnification affects these, as well as the effectiveness of using an informed initial guess. Results derived from high-precision rotational splittings show clearly that the location of the tachocline at low latitudes is different for its position at high latitudes. The latitudinal variation of its width is not significantly constrained, but our results agree with estimates based on forward modeling. When using splittings derived from somewhat shorter time series, we find temporal variations that are neither definitive nor significant, since we see systematic differences when using different methodologies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating particle acceleration in the Wolf-Rayet bubble NGC 2359</a><span class="id">[2602.02923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars have been proposed as candidates to be major factories of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs).However, this claim lacks enough empirical evidence, especially for isolated this http URL powerful stellar winds from massive stars impact the ambient medium producing strong shocks suitable for accelerating relativistic this http URL detection of non-thermal emission-particularly synchrotron emission in low radio frequencies-serves as a key proof of particle acceleration this http URL aim to assess the potential of isolated massive stars as sources of this http URL observed the Wolf-Rayet bubble, NGC 2359, using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope at Band 3 (250-500 MHz) and Band 4 (550-950 MHz).Additionally, we used complementary archival radio datasets at different frequencies to derive the broad spectral energy distribution (SED) for several regions within the this http URL further characterize the interaction between the stellar wind and the ambient medium, we introduced a composite SED model including synchrotron and free-free emission, and two low-frequency turnover processes, the Razin-Tsytovich (RT) effect and free-free absorption (FFA).We used a Bayesian inference approach to fit the SEDs and constrain the electron number density and magnetic field this http URL SEDs of several regions reveal spectral indices steeper than -0.5, indicative of synchrotron emission. and show a turnover below  1 this http URL SED modelling suggests that the observed turnover is primarily caused by the RT effect, with a minor contribution from internal this http URL analysis confirms the presence of synchrotron radiation within NGC this http URL is the second detection of non-thermal emission in a stellar bubble surrounding a WR star, reinforcing the idea that such environments are sites of relativistic particle acceleration and supporting the hypothesis that isolated massive stars are sources of GCRs of at least GeV energies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Line-Intensity Mapping</a><span class="id">[2602.03011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Line-Intensity Mapping (LIM) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying large-scale structure and the high-redshift universe, enabling three-dimensional maps of line emission across vast cosmological volumes.

We selected a sample of 26 bright GRBs with measured redshifts $z&lt;1$ observed by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (Swift) and simulated what BAT would have observed if the GRBs were at larger redshifts. We measured the durations of the simulated gamma-ray signals using a Bayesian block approach and calculated the enclosed fluences and peak fluxes. As expected, we found that almost all durations (fluences) measured for simulated high-$z$ GRBs were shorter (less) than their true durations (energies) due to low signal-to-noise ratio emission becoming completely dominated by background, i.e., the “tip-of-the-iceberg” effect. This effect strongly depends on the profile and intensity of the source light curve. Due to the uniqueness of GRB light curves, there is no common behavior in the evolution of measured durations with redshift. We compared our synthetic high-$z$ (i.e., $z&gt;3$) GRBs to a sample of 72 observed high-$z$ bursts and found that the two samples were not inconsistent with being drawn from the same underlying population. We conclude that: (i) prompt emission durations (fluences) of high-$z$ GRBs observed by Swift/BAT are most likely underestimations, sometimes by factors of $\sim$several tens ($\sim2$), and (ii) changes in the average GRB prompt emission duration and fluence with increasing redshift are consistent with the tip-of-the-iceberg effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03078" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-term timing evolution of four Anomalous X-Ray Pulsars</a><span class="id">[2602.03078]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) and soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) are believed to be manifestations of magnetars. Typically, AXPs exhibit higher X-ray luminosities, whereas SGRs are generally fainter and display significantly high signal-to-noise ratios only during their outburst phases. In this work, we report the long-term timing evolution of four AXPs: 1E 2259+586, 4U 0142+61, 1RXS J170849.0-400910 and 1E 1841-045, which were regularly monitored with NICER from 2017 to 2024. Over this period, we identify a total of 10 timing events. In addition to one glitch and one anti-glitch in 1E 2259+586 reported in literature, we detect another 8 new timing events: 5 glitches, 2 anti-glitches, and 1 unusual state transition event. Notably, both anti-glitches were observed in 4U 0142+61, making it the most frequent source of such events, and there is a hint of regular evolution in its pulse profile. In the case of 1RXS J170849.0-400910, it continues to exhibit pronounced high-frequency timing anomalies and undergoes a state transition event. Finally, we study the evolution of the pulse profiles and find that the profiles of 1E 2259+586 and 4U 0142+61 both evolve. This is consistent with the earlier finding that pulse profile evolution is a generic feature of magnetars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03079" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The orbital parameters of gamma-ray binary PSR J2032+4127</a><span class="id">[2602.03079]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PSR J2032+4127 is the only one of gamma-ray binary, that exhibits pulsations in gamma-ray.

KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level – attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT.

The outflows are generally accepted to be driven by radiation pressure acting on dust grains that form in the dense extended atmospheres created by the action of convection and stellar pulsations. The complex physics underlying convection, stellar pulsations, and dust nucleation precludes predicting AGB mass loss from first principles. We investigated the evolution of two lobes observed to be expanding away from the AGB star Mira A using images of polarized light obtained at six epochs using SPHERE on the VLT and of molecular emission at two epochs obtained with ALMA. While dust seems confined to the edges of the lobes, gas fills the lobes and displays higher densities than expected at the observed radii based on the large-scale mass-loss rate of Mira A, with a total gas mass in the lobes of $\sim 2 \times 10^{-5}~M_\odot$. We find the expansion of the lobes to be consistent with both a constant velocity (ejection time in 2010 or 2011) or a decelerating expansion (ejection time in 2012). If ejection events with a similar magnitude happen periodically, we derive periods between 50 and 200 years to account for the mass-loss rate of Mira A. This periodicity is uncertain because the average mass-loss rate of Mira A on larger scales is uncertain. We find abundances in the lobes of $\sim 1.5 \times 10^{-6}$ and $\sim 2.5 \times 10^{-6}$ for SO and SO$_2$, respectively, and of $2\times10^{-10}$, $6.5\times10^{-10}$, and $4\times10^{-7}$ for AlO, AlF, and PO. The strong variation in brightness of the different features identified in the polarized-light images is puzzling. We suggest that an asymmetric stellar radiation field preferentially illuminates specific regions of the circumstellar envelope at a given time, producing a lighthouse-like effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03313" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeing Wiggles without Seeing Wiggles: BAO Recovery in 21 cm Intensity Mapping with Deep Learning</a><span class="id">[2602.03313]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21 cm intensity mapping provides a promising probe of the large-scale structure. Astrophysical foregrounds, as the main source of contamination to the cosmological 21 cm signal, persist in a wedge-like region of Fourier space due to the inherent chromaticity in radio interferometric observations. The foreground avoidance strategy focuses on utilizing data from relatively clean regions with minimal foreground leakage, at the cost of losing large-scale information. Non-linear structure formation, however, couples Fourier modes across scales, leaving imprints of the missing large-scale modes in the remaining data. In this work, we employ a deep learning approach to test whether large-scale features of the 21 cm brightness temperature fields, particularly the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), can be recovered at the field level using only short-wavelength modes that are beyond the linear scales. To explicitly assess the dependence on the training cosmology, we train the network exclusively on de-wiggled simulations, providing a controlled test of whether the reconstruction arises from physical non-linear mode coupling rather than implicit encoding of BAO features. In the ideal noise-free case, the amplitude and phase of the lost modes can be restored with high fidelity. With instrumental noise included, the reconstructed amplitude becomes biased, while the phase information remains robust. The trained network also exhibits reasonable robustness to variations in the underlying cosmological model. Together, these results suggest that mode restoration offers a complementary approach for extracting cosmological information from future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03382" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emulating galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering on non-linear scales</a><span class="id">[2602.03382]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the potential of cross-correlating galaxies and peculiar velocities on non-linear scales to enhance cosmological constraints. Leveraging the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism, we train emulator models to describe the non-linear clustering of galaxies and velocities in redshift space. Our analysis demonstrates that combining galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering, provides tighter constraints on both HOD and cosmological parameters, particularly on $\sigma_8$ and $w_0$. We further apply our models to realistic mock catalogues, reproducing the expected density and peculiar velocity errors of type-Ia supernovae and Tully-Fisher/fundamental plane measurements for the combined ZTF and DESI measurements. While systematic biases arise in the HOD parameters, the cosmological constraints remain unbiased, yielding $3.8\%$ precision measurement on $f\sigma_8$ compared to $4.7\%$ using galaxy clustering alone. We demonstrate that, while combining tracers with realistic velocity measurements still yields improvement, the gains are diminished, highlighting the need for further efforts to reduce velocity measurement uncertainties and correct observational systematics on small scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03393" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The asymmetric structure of the inner disc around HD 142527 A with VLTI/MATISSE</a><span class="id">[2602.03393]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Circumstellar discs, and especially their inner regions, covering ranges from &lt;1 au to a few astronomical units, are the birthplaces of terrestrial planets. The inner regions are thought to be similarly diverse in structure as the well-observed outer regions probed by ALMA. Combining data and results from previous studies of the VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY instruments with new, multi-epoch VLTI/MATISSE observations, we aim to provide a comprehensive picture of the structure of the inner regions of the circumstellar disc around the F-type Herbig Ae/Be star HD 142527 A, the primary of a binary star system. We model the multi-wavelength interferometric data using a parametrised, geometrically thin disc model, allowing for azimuthal asymmetry, exploring a first-order disc modulation and an off-centre Gaussian component. We find time-variable structures in the N-band observables, which we reproduce with time-dependent models. This variability manifests as azimuthally asymmetric emission, evidenced by strong, non-zero closure phases in the N-band data. Fits to individual epochs of the N-band observations yield better $\chi^2_\text{r}$ values than fits to all epochs simultaneously. This suggests substantial changes in the geometry of the inner disc emission from  1 au up to a few astronomical-unit scales from one year to the next. Moreover, our models produce a very close-in inner disc rim $R_\text{rim}\approx0.1$ au. All together, we find a very complex, substantially non-point symmetric and temporally-variable disc ($r_\text{out}\lesssim6$ au) around the primary. The very close-in inner rim indicates the presence of material inside the typical wall-like sublimation radius $R_\text{rim,literature}\approx0.3$ au. The complex, temporally variable inner-disc geometry is likely affected or even caused by the close passing ( 5 au) and short orbit ($P\approx24$ yr) of the companion HD 142527 B.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ESO SupJup Survey IX: Isotopic evidence of a recent formation for Luhman 16AB</a><span class="id">[2602.03409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The distinct formation pathways of directly-imaged exoplanets and isolated brown dwarfs might leave imprints in the inherited elemental and isotopic abundances, but such measurements require careful characterisation of the atmospheres. In particular, L-T transition objects exhibit signs of dynamics that drive their atmospheres out of chemical equilibrium. In this work, we studied the nearest L-T brown dwarfs, Luhman 16A and B, to assess the chemical dis-equilibrium in their atmospheres and to investigate their elemental and isotopic composition. As part of the ESO SupJup Survey, we obtained high-resolution CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra of the binary, which were analysed using an atmospheric retrieval framework. We detect and retrieve the abundances of $^{12}$CO, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, NH$_3$, H$_2$S, HF, and the $^{13}$CO isotopologue. Both atmospheres are in chemical dis-equilibrium with somewhat stronger vertical mixing in Luhman 16A compared to B ($K_\mathrm{zz,A}\sim10^{8.7}$, $K_\mathrm{zz,B}\sim10^{8.2}\ \mathrm{cm^2\ s^{-1}}$). The tested chemical models, free- and dis-equilibrium chemistry, yield consistent mixing ratios and agree with earlier work at shorter wavelengths. The gaseous C/O ratios show evidence of oxygen trapping in silicate-oxide clouds. While the C/O ratios are consistent with solar, the metallicities are modestly enhanced with $\mathrm{[C/H]}\sim0.15$. The carbon isotope ratios are measured at $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_A}=74^{+2}_{-2}$ and $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C_B}=74^{+3}_{-3}$. The coincident constraints of metallicities and isotopes across the binary reinforce their likely shared formation. The $\mathrm{^{12}C/^{13}C}$ ratios are aligned with the present-day interstellar medium, but lower than the solar-system value. This suggests a recent inheritance and corroborates the relatively young age ($\sim500$ Myr) of Luhman 16AB as members of the Oceanus moving group.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2024igg: A Super-Chandrasekhar/03fg-like SN exhibiting C II-dominated spectra after explosion</a><span class="id">[2602.03427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present and analyze photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2024igg, another “super-Chandrasekhar” (or 03fg-like) SN whose strong C II $\lambda6580$ feature was initially misidentified as H$\alpha$, thereby constraining its progenitor system, explosion parameters, and physical scenario. SN 2024igg shows many characteristics in common with other 03fg-like objects, such as high ultraviolet flux, slowly declining light curves ($\Delta m_{15}(B)=0.90\pm0.08$ mag), low expansion velocities, along with strong and persistent C II absorption. Meanwhile, this SN exhibits some remarkable properties within this subgroup, including a moderately low optical luminosity ($M_{\rm max}(B)=-18.99\pm0.15$ mag), a short rise time less than 18.5 days, and strong C II $\lambda6580$. The bolometric analysis yields a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm Ni}=0.547\pm0.082$ $M_{\rm \odot}$ and an ejecta mass of $1.54^{+0.22}_{-0.19}$ $M_{\rm \odot}$, marginally exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass. Our TARDIS result indicates that most of the features in the earliest spectrum could be attributed to C II, which is consistent with a model where a supernova explodes within a carbon-rich circumstellar medium (CSM). The CSM interaction would produce a density peak in the ejecta, offering a natural explanation for the slowly evolving line velocities near $-$8000 km s$^{-1}$. The CSM may stem from the debris of a secondary white dwarf in a white-dwarf merger or the envelope of an asymptotic giant branch star. Combined with the unshifted forbidden lines in the spectrum taken at $t\approx\ +$135 days, we suggest that SN 2024igg comes from a symmetric explosion on a secular timescale after the merger.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surface Density of Disk Galaxies in MOND</a><span class="id">[2602.03434]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, we extend a paper by Milgrom (2009, MNRAS 398, 1023) dealing with the existence of a quasi-universal surface density for object of all mass and structure, if they are in the Newtonian regime, i.e., that their mean acceleration is larger than MOND typical acceleration $a_0$.

HIP 67522 b, a 17 Myr old hot Jupiter with an extraordinarily low bulk density, represents an ideal target for high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. We aim to characterize the atmospheric composition, thermal structure, and dynamics of HIP 67522 b using ground-based high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopy. We obtained high-resolution spectra with VLT/CRIRES+ in the K2166 band during a transit on 30 January 2025. We applied cross-correlation techniques and Bayesian nested sampling retrievals to constrain molecular abundances, temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics. We detect H$_2$O at 20$\sigma$ and CO at 5$\sigma$, confirming the extremely extended atmosphere of this low-mass giant. A velocity offset of $-2.9 \pm 0.2$ km s$^{-1}$ indicates day-to-night winds. The rotation velocity is constrained to $&lt;1.8$ km s$^{-1}$ at 3$\sigma$, consistent with tidal locking. Retrieval analysis suggests a planetary mass of 29.8 $\pm$ 3 Earth masses and a vertically isothermal atmosphere. This mass is two times larger than the mass estimated from JWST atmospheric observations and inconsistent at 3$\sigma$ hence leaving a doubt on the actual planetary density of the planet. Using the mass derived derived from the CRIRES+ data, we derive a C/O ratio of $0.83 \pm 0.09$, about 1.5 times solar, and a subsolar metallicity [C+O/H] $= -0.8 \pm 0.4$ which can be increased if the atmosphere is cloudy, a degeneracy our data alone cannot resolve. We report a tentative 2$\sigma$ detection of HDO with an extreme enrichment factor of $\sim$1000 relative to the protosolar D/H ratio. If confirmed, this would be the first detection of deuterium in an exoplanet atmosphere and would require intense escape rate to be explained.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Similarities and differences between solar and stellar flare pulsation processes</a><span class="id">[2602.03499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are oscillatory signatures commonly detected in the light curves of solar and stellar flares, offering valuable diagnostics of the underlying magnetic and plasma processes. This review compares the observational characteristics, detection methods, and physical interpretations of QPPs in both solar and stellar contexts. Solar flare QPPs, extensively studied in X-rays and EUV bands using instruments such as GOES, STIX, and Fermi, display typical periods of tens of seconds and show correlations with flare duration and magnetic loop length. Stellar QPPs, observed in X-rays and white light by missions such as Kepler, TESS, and XMM-Newton, exhibit much longer periods - ranging from minutes to hours - consistent with larger-scale magnetic structures in more active stars. Despite differences in scale and observing band, statistical and comparative studies reveal common scaling relations and damping behaviors, suggesting that both solar and stellar QPPs are manifestations of the same fundamental mechanisms, likely magnetohydrodynamic oscillations or oscillatory reconnection within flare loops. The comparison underscores a continuity between solar and stellar magnetic activity, linking the solar detailed physical processes to stellar-scale phenomena and providing constraints for future models and surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03552" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post-impulsive millimeter emission of the 2022-05-04 solar flare</a><span class="id">[2602.03552]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The present work aims at analyzing the nature of millimeter (mm) emission observed during the post-impulsive phase of the solar flare SOL2022-05-04T08:45 (M5.7), detected by the RT-7.5 radio telescope of the Bauman Moscow State Technical University at 93 GHz.

However, it has recently been found that the long-term stability of the Twotino population is strongly affected when including Pluto as a massive object in simulations, while Eris, with a similar mass, has a negligible effect. Aims: We hypothesize that the effect of Pluto on Twotinos results from the latter being trapped in a 4:3 mean motion resonance (MMR) with Pluto. In this work, we aim to demonstrate the resonant behavior of Twotinos within Pluto's 4:3 MMR and the significance of this resonance for the long-term evolution of the population. Methods: We run high-resolution, 10 Myr REBOUND simulations of the observed Twotino population in the Kuiper belt, under the perturbations of the Sun, the four giant planets, and Pluto, as massive objects. Results: We find that all objects trapped in the 2:1 MMR with Neptune are locked in a weak 4:3 MMR with Pluto. The 4:3 resonant angles of most objects trapped in the leading and trailing islands of the 2:1 MMR, librate with amplitudes lower than $360^\circ$. Objects in the symmetric islands of the 2:1 MMR librate in the 4:3 MMR with amplitudes greater than $360^\circ$, but, contrary to circulating objects, will oscillate by up to $840^\circ$ visiting preferred angles on Pluto's co-rotating frame, indicating a diluted resonant effect that may also perturb their orbits on secular timescales. Conclusions: The importance of Pluto in shaping the structure of the trans-Neptunian region should be reconsidered, especially for resonant populations. Moreover, with current computational power, its exclusion from simulations can not be justified.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A case for Case A: detailed look at binary black hole formation through stable mass transfer</a><span class="id">[2602.03629]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In isolated binary evolution, binary black hole (BBH) mergers are generally formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) or common envelope evolution.

Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z&gt;0.2Z_\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $\chi_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $\chi_{eff}=0$ and  0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03638" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light-Curve and Spectral Properties of Type II Supernovae from the ATLAS survey</a><span class="id">[2602.03638]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type II supernovae (SNe II) are the most common terminal stellar explosions in the Universe. With SNe now being detected within days after explosion, there is growing evidence that the majority of Type II SNe show signs of interaction with a confined, dense cirumstellar material (CSM) in the first few days post explosion. In this work we aim to bridge the gap between single SN studies showing early-time interaction in their spectra, and the statistical studies of early-time SN light curves, which imply the existence of CSM. We present a sample of 68 Type II SNe with both early photometric data, obtained with the ATLAS survey, and spectroscopic data, obtained with the ePESSTO+ collaboration. A subset of the sample is classified based on the presence or absence of narrow spectral features with electron-scattered broadened wings in the early spectra, indicative of interaction with CSM. We characterise the photometric and spectroscopic properties of the sample by measuring rise times to maximum light, peak magnitudes, decline rates and line velocities. Additionally, we measure the ratio of absorption to emission (a/e) of the H alpha P-Cygni profile. Our analysis reveals that SNe II showing early spectroscopic signs of interaction with CSM decline faster and are brighter than those without. However no difference is found in rise times between the two groups. A clear separation is observed in the a/e ratio: SNe with signs of interaction exhibit lower a/e ratios at all epochs compared to those without. Our results highlight that understanding SN II ejecta-CSM interaction requires large, uniform samples of photometric and spectroscopic data, such as the one presented in this work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Tarantula Massive Binary Monitoring VII. On the nature of the eccentric O+BH binary candidate VFTS 812</a><span class="id">[2602.03650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive O-type stars ($M\gtrsim15\,M_\odot$) with an X-ray quiet black hole (BH) companion represent a crucial stage in massive binary evolution leading to binary BH mergers. The population of such binaries remains elusive, with $\lesssim5$ candidate or confirmed systems. The Tarantula nebula harbors thousands of massive stars, 2-3 % of which are expected to have BH companions. It is therefore an ideal place to hunt for such systems. Here we analyse 30 epochs of VLT/FLAMES IFU high-resolution observations of the H$\delta$ region, as well as archival FLAMES spectroscopy, of VFTS 812, a 17-day single-lined spectroscopic binary with an O4V primary and a minimum secondary mass of $5.1\,M_\odot$. Following careful removal of the nebular contamination, spectral disentangling on the new data did not reveal any signature of the hidden companion. We derive $T_\mathrm{eff}=49^{+3}_{-4}$ kK, $\log L/L_\odot=5.7\pm0.1$ and $v_\mathrm{rot,max}{\rm \,sin\,}i=110^{+25}_{-35}$ km/s for the O4V component, yielding a (single star) evolutionary mass of $53^{+6}_{-5}$ $M_\odot$ and an age in the range of 0-1.6 Myr. Using injection tests of various luminous artificial companions in our data, we exhaustively rule out the presence of any luminous signature from a main sequence star more massive than $6\,M_\odot$. We discuss the possible nature of the companion, suggesting that the rejuvenated O star + BH companion is the most suitable scenario to consistently explain the location, (rejuvenated) young age, eccentricity and lack of companion signature. While this establishes VFTS 812 as a strong candidate O+BH system, follow-up observations are deemed necessary for robust confirmation and to search for accretion signatures on the O4V star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Architectures of Planetary Systems II: Trends with Host Star Mass and Metallicity</a><span class="id">[2602.03657]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current census of planetary systems displays a wide range of architectures. Extending earlier work, this paper investigates the correlation between our classification framework for these architectures and host stellar properties. Specifically, we explore how planetary system properties depend on stellar mass and stellar metallicity. This work confirms previously detected trends that jovian planets are less prevalent for low-mass and low-metallicity stars. We also find new, but expected trends such as that the total mass in planets increases with stellar mass, and that observed planetary system masses show an upper limit that is roughly consistent with expectations from the stability of circumstellar disks. We tentatively identify potential unique trends in the host stars of super-puffs and hot jupiters and a possible subdivision of the class of hot jupiter systems. In general, we find that system architectures are not overly dependent on host star properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining cosmological simulations with peculiar velocities: a forward-modeling approach</a><span class="id">[2602.03699]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Numerical simulations are a key tool to decipher the dynamics of gravitation. Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive. We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations. Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z &lt; 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code. A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster. Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed. Furthermore, improving the model is easy thanks to the inherent flexibility of the Bayesian approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational imprints of tidal internal gravity wave dissipation in star-planet systems</a><span class="id">[2602.03723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal interactions play a crucial role in the orbital evolution of close-in star-planet systems. There are numerous manifestations of tides, including planetary orbital migration, breaking resonant chains, tidal heating, orbital circularization, spin-orbit alignment, and stellar and planetary spin synchronization. In the present study, we focus on the dissipation of internal gravity waves within stars. We examine two mechanisms: wave breaking in stars with radiative cores and magnetic wave conversion in stars with convective cores. Applying tidal prescriptions modelling these processes, we demonstrate that the enhanced stellar rotation of both TOI-2458 and GJ 504 can be explained by the previous engulfment of a hot Jupiter caused by gravity wave damping. Furthermore, we show that the observed population of hot Jupiters can be divided into two distinct subsamples: those that are too young for gravity wave dissipation and those where it is ongoing. These subsamples exhibit qualitatively different orbital period distributions: young systems have a uniform distribution, while older systems show a steep decline at short orbital periods. Using a population synthesis approach, we successfully reproduce the main features of the older hot Jupiter sample based on the distribution of the younger systems. According to our estimates, up to 20% of the main-sequence stars within the mass range [0.7,1.5] $M_{\odot}$ that once hosted a hot Jupiter may have since engulfed it. Our results highlight the key role of internal gravity wave dissipation in shaping the orbital architectures of hot Jupiter systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Temporal variations of solar inertial mode parameters from GONG (2002–2024) and HMI (2010–2024): Rossby modes ($3 \leq m \leq 16 $) and $m=1$ high-latitude mode</a><span class="id">[2602.03741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the temporal evolution of solar inertial modes over the solar cycle using observations from GONG and SDO/HMI. We focus on the high-latitude mode with azimuthal wavenumber $m=1$ and the equatorial Rossby modes with $3 \le m \le 16$. We use maps of horizontal flows near the solar surface from the GONG and HMI ring-diagram pipelines at a cadence of approximately one day, covering the period 2002–2024. The data are divided into overlapping four-year windows, with central times separated by six months. Within each time window and for each inertial mode, we measure the frequency and the power of the mode from the GONG and HMI data. We find good agreement between the GONG and HMI measurements throughout their overlapping period from 2010 to 2024. In general, the magnitude of the frequency variations increases with increasing $m$, while relative changes in mode power typically exceed 100\%. For the $m=1$ high-latitude mode, the measured power is anti-correlated with the sunspot number, while its frequency shows no significant temporal variation. For the equatorial Rossby modes, the frequencies are generally anti-correlated with the sunspot number, whereas the mode powers tend to correlate positively with the sunspot number. An exception is the $m=3$ equatorial Rossby mode, whose mode power is strongly anti-correlated with the sunspot number, in contrast to the other equatorial Rossby modes, highlighting its distinct behavior. We find that the frequencies and power of the Sun's inertial modes exhibit significant variability on solar-cycle timescales over the past 23 years. The mode parameters are however not uniformly synchronized with the sunspot number; clear differences are observed both from mode to mode and from one solar cycle to the next. The sensitivity of inertial modes to solar-cycle changes indicates their potential as a diagnostic of solar interior dynamics and magnetism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modified Teleparallel $f(T)$ Gravity, DESI BAO and the $H_0$ Tension</a><span class="id">[2601.22225]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether late-time modifications of gravity in the teleparallel framework can impact the current tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, focusing on $f(T)$ cosmology as a minimal and well-controlled extension of General Relativity. We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scale-Invariant Bounce Cosmology in Weyl f(Q) Gravity with Quintom Signature</a><span class="id">[2602.02576]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a bouncing cosmological model within the Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity framework, employing a power-law form of the non-metricity scalar $Q$. The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \dot{a}(t)&lt;0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \dot{a}(t)&gt;0 $) at the bouncing point $t \approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($\omega=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce. These results underscore the viability of Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity as a framework for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies, offering insights into early universe dynamics and dark energy behaviour.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational signatures of charged Bardeen black holes in perfect fluid dark matter with a cloud of strings</a><span class="id">[2602.02586]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a charged Bardeen black hole (BH) surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) and coupled to a cloud of strings (CS).

The standard cosmological model contains a generic initial singularity usually referred to as the {\em big bang}. Herein, we present a novel idea to extend the description of our Universe beyond this limit. The proposal relies on rewriting physics in a purely Riemannian, {\em i.e.} locally Euclidean, 4-dimensional space and the emergence of Lorentzian patches owing to the interaction of all matter fields to a clock field that is responsible for a signature change. If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large “Euclidean sea” in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours. While speculative, this scenario has specific features that can be tested, and the present letter sets the basis for further phenomenological investigations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The favoured twin: on the dynamical response of twin stars to perturbations</a><span class="id">[2602.02654]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>If a strong first-order phase transition takes place at sufficiently high rest-mass densities in the equation of state (EOS) modelling compact stars, a new branch will appear in the mass-radius sequence of stable equilibria. This branch will be populated by stars comprising a quark-matter core and a hadronic-matter envelope, i.e., hybrid stars, which represent “twin-star” solutions to equilibria having the same mass but a fully hadronic EOS. While both branches are stable to linear perturbations, it is unclear which of the twin solutions is the “favoured” one, that is, which of the two configurations is expected to be found in nature. We assess this point by performing a large campaign of general-relativistic simulations aimed at assessing the response of compact stars on the two branches to perturbations of various strength. In this way, we find that, independently of whether the stars populate the hadronic or the twin branch, their response is characterised by a critical-perturbation strength such that the star will oscillate on the original branch for subcritical perturbations and migrate to the neighbouring branch for supercritical perturbations while conserving rest-mass. Because the critical values are different for stars with the same rest-mass but sitting on either branch, it is possible to define as favoured the part of the branch that has the largest critical perturbation, thus correcting the common wisdom that stellar models on the twin branch are the favoured ones. Interestingly, we show that the binding energies on the two branches can be used to deduce without simulations which of the stellar configurations is more likely to be found in nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ubiquitous flavor pendulum</a><span class="id">[2602.02655]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A system of classical interacting spins can develop collective instabilities which, in the nonlinear regime, mimic the motion of a gyroscopic pendulum.

It has been identified in homogeneous slow and fast flavor systems and, most recently, in single-wave solutions of the fast system. We explain the reasons for its ubiquitous appearance. We show that a system of three classical spins must always be pendular, or only two in the presence of an external field. Furthermore, such a system always defines a continuum of vectors with time-independent length. If these are identified as interacting spins, they immediately lead to the continuum cases of slow and fast flavor pendula. As another new insight, any of these spins can be chosen as the pendulum, periodically exchanging flavor with the rest of the system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02682" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Consistent Evaluation of the No-Boundary Proposal</a><span class="id">[2602.02682]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal.

That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes.

We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Lambda\Lambda N$ interaction parameters within the Skyrme Hartree-Fock framework, constrained by both hypernuclei experimental data and astrophysical observations. Our results show that the parameter space of the $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction is tightly constrained by combining nuclear and astrophysical data, while the parameters of the $\Lambda\Lambda N$ three-body interaction remain sensitive to astrophysical inputs alone. Specifically, the local, momentum-independent two-body interaction parameter $\lambda_0$ is tightly constrained and predominantly attractive, while the momentum-dependent parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ contribute repulsive effects at high densities. A key role is played by the $\Lambda\Lambda$ potential depth in pure $\Lambda$ matter, which effectively constrains the two-body $\Lambda\Lambda$ interaction and governs the balance between attraction at low densities and repulsion at high densities. The repulsive components of $\Lambda\Lambda$ interactions then decrease hyperon fractions and reconcile hyperon-rich equations of state with the observed $\sim2\,M_{\odot}$ neutron stars, increasing the maximum mass by up to 22\%. The inclusion of $\Lambda\Lambda N$ three-body forces further stiffens the EOS, raising the maximum mass by up to $\sim 0.1\,M_{\odot}$.

The reported “sub-Alfvénic switchback dropout” follows from two diagnostic biases: conditioning on an instantaneous $M_a$, which is transiently elevated above unity by radial-velocity enhancements during large-amplitude Alfvénic rotations, and short-window local-mean backgrounds that partially track these rotations and suppress deflection angles. Treating $M_a$ as a bulk-stream property via rolling medians and referencing deflections to event-independent backgrounds – a Parker-spiral direction or a sufficiently long rolling median – recovers sub-Alfvénic switchbacks systematically. The mean deflection $\langle \theta \rangle$ separates into two regimes with $M_a$. For $M_a \lesssim 1$, $\langle \theta \rangle$ rises rapidly with weak dependence on the background window, consistent with expansion-driven amplification of Alfvénic fluctuations. For $M_a \gtrsim 1$, the evolution becomes scale dependent: large-scale $\langle \theta \rangle$ continues to grow with $M_a$ at reduced rate, while small-scale growth saturates, consistent with turbulent decay and dissipation. Collectively, these results indicate that switchbacks need not originate only in the super-Alfvénic solar wind. Instead, they are consistent with a formation pathway in which coronal fluctuations are amplified by large-scale expansion through the sub-Alfvénic regime, with subsequent propagation into the super-Alfvénic wind where turbulent decay modifies their scale-dependent properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Correlator Discontinuities from Scattering Amplitudes</a><span class="id">[2602.03841]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent theoretical work has revealed that basic observables of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, known as in-in or cosmological correlators, exhibit surprisingly simple mathematical structure reminiscent of scattering amplitudes in flat space. For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of “cosmological dressing rules” which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams. This observation in turn implies highly non-trivial constraints on cosmological correlators in the form of simple sum rules. We illustrate these ideas in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop for conformally coupled scalar theories, although they hold more generally. Finally, we show how to reconstruct cosmological correlators from their discontinuities using dispersion relations, providing a powerful new approach to computing cosmological observables by systematically reconstructing them from data uplifted from flat space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Origin and Dynamics of Solar Magnetic Fields</a><span class="id">[1604.00563]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Sun is a magnetically active star and is the source of the solar wind, electromagnetic radiation and energetic particles which affect the heliosphere and the Earths atmosphere.

Specifically, this thesis focuses on two themes: in the first part, we study the origin and behaviour of solar magnetic fields using magnetohydrodynamic dynamo theory and modelling, and in the second part, utilizing observations and data analysis we study two major problems in solar physics, namely, the coronal heating problem and initiation mechanisms of solar flares.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact object of HESS J1731-347 and its implication on neutron star matter</a><span class="id">[2408.15220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate the impact of the possibility of a small, subsolar mass compact star, such as the recently reported central compact object of HESS J1731-347, on the equation of state (EOS) of neutron stars. We have used a hybrid approach to the nuclear EOS developed recently where the matter around nuclear saturation density is described by a parametric expansion in terms of nuclear empirical parameters and represented in an agnostic way at higher density using piecewise polytropes. We have incorporated the inputs provided by the latest neutron skin measurement experiments from PREX-II and CREX, simultaneous mass-radius measurements of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, and the gravitational wave events GW170817 and GW190425. The main results of the study show the effect of HESS J1731-347 on the nuclear parameters and neutron star observables. Our analysis yields the slope of symmetry energy $L=45.71^{+38.18}_{-22.11}$ MeV, the radius of a $1.4 M_\odot$ star, $R_{1.4}=12.18^{+0.71}_{-0.88}$ km, and the maximum mass of a static star, $M_{\rm max}= 2.14^{+0.26}_{-0.17} M_\odot$ within $90\%$ confidence interval, respectively.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large scale structure prior knowledge in the dark siren method</a><span class="id">[2410.03275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave dark sirens are a powerful tool for cosmology and inference of compact object population hyperparameters. They allow for a measurement of the luminosity distance to the source, but not their redshift. Galaxy catalogues in the source localization volume can be used to infer the redshift of the source in a statistical manner. Catalogues are, however, limited by their incompleteness, which can be significant at redshifts corresponding to current GW events. In this work, we detail how to implement in practice variance completion, a novel galaxy completion method which uses knowledge of the large scale structure to optimize the potential of dark sirens analyses. We compress the prediction for the missing number of galaxies into a ratio between the predictions of variance completion and the standard homogeneous completion method. This ratio format can be easily incorporated into existing line of sight computations used in dark sirens software; we demonstrate this procedure using the GLADE+ galaxy catalogue and the gwcosmo software package. We discuss the robustness of the method, and apply it to well-localized event GW190814 as a proof of concept. Finally, we apply the method to data from the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, finding that it yields results that are consistent with homogeneous completion. We also discuss the prospects for an improvement if the GW localization volume shrinks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey: implications for cosmological expansion models from the final DES Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Supernova data</a><span class="id">[2503.06712]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Dark Energy Survey (DES) recently released the final results of its two principal probes of the expansion history: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We explore the cosmological implications of these data in combination with external Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and age-of-the-Universe information. The BAO measurement, $\sim2\sigma$ away from Planck's $\Lambda$CDM predictions, pushes for low values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ compared to Planck, in contrast to SN which prefers a higher value. We identify several tensions among datasets in the $\Lambda$CDM model that cannot be resolved by including either curvature or a constant dark energy equation of state. By combining BAO+SN+CMB despite these mild tensions, we obtain $\Omega_k$=$-5.5^{+4.6}_{-4.2}\times10^{-3}$ in $k\Lambda$CDM, and $w=-0.948^{+0.028}_{-0.027}$ in $w$CDM. In $w$CDM, BAO and SN push again in different directions of parameter space, favoring, respectively $w&lt;-1$ and $w&gt;-1$. If we open the parameter space to $w_0w_a$CDM, all the datasets are mutually more compatible, and we find concordance in the $w_0&gt;-1,w_a&lt;0$ quadrant, with BAO pushing for $w_a&lt;0$ and SN for $[w_0&gt;-1,w_a&lt;0]$. For DES BAO and SN in combination with Planck-CMB, we find a $3.2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, with $w_0=-0.673^{+0.098}_{-0.097}$, $w_a = -1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.50}$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.81^{+0.96}_{-0.86}$km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, and an abundance of matter of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.3109^{+0.0086}_{-0.0099}$. For the combination of all the background cosmological probes considered we still find a deviation of $2.8\sigma$ from $\Lambda$CDM in the $w_0-w_a$ plane. Assuming a minimal neutrino mass, this work provides tentative evidence for non-$\Lambda$CDM physics, which is consistent with recent claims in support of evolving dark energy, or a source of unknown systematics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23354" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Constraints on Dark Photon Dark Matter with a Millimeter-Wave Dielectric Haloscope</a><span class="id">[2503.23354]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter remains one of the most profound and unresolved mysteries in modern physics. To unravel its nature, numerous haloscope experiments have been implemented across various mass ranges. However, very few haloscope experiments conducted within millimeter-wave frequency range, which is in the favored mass region for well-motivated dark matter candidates. Here we designed and constructed a millimeter-wave dielectric haloscope featuring a dark matter detector composed of dielectric disks and a mirror. Using this setup, we conducted a search for randomly polarized dark photon dark matter and found no evidence for its existence. Our results established new constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter in the mass range from $387.72$ to $391.03$ $\mu eV$, improving the existing limits by two orders of magnitude. With future enhancements, our system has the potential to explore new parameter space for dark photon as well as axion dark matter within the millimeter-wave frequency range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02943" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometry and Spectroscopy of SN 2024pxl: A Luminosity Link Among Type Iax Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2505.02943]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present extensive ultraviolet to optical photometric and optical to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic follow-up observations of the nearby intermediate-luminosity ($M_V = -16.81\pm0.19$ mag) Type Iax supernova (SN) 2024pxl in NGC 6384. SN 2024pxl exhibits a faster light curve than the high-luminosity members of this class, and slower than low-luminosity events. The observationally well-constrained rise time of $\sim$11 days and an estimated synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of 0.03 M$_\odot$, based on analytical modeling of the integrated spectral energy distribution light curve, are consistent with models of the weak deflagration of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Our optical spectral sequence of SN 2024pxl shows weak \ion{Si}{2} lines and spectral evolution similar to other high-luminosity Type Iax SNe, but also a prominent early-time \ion{C}{2} line, like lower-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The late-time optical spectrum of SN 2024pxl closely matches that of SN 2014dt, and its NIR spectral evolution aligns with that of other well-studied, high-luminosity Type Iax SNe. The spectral-line expansion velocities of SN 2024pxl are at the lower end of the Type Iax SN velocity distribution, and the velocity distribution of iron-group elements compared to intermediate-mass elements suggests that the ejecta are mixed on large scales, as expected in pure deflagration models. SN 2024pxl exhibits characteristics intermediate between those of high-luminosity and low-luminosity Type Iax SNe, further establishing a link across this diverse class.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power law $α$-Starobinsky inflation</a><span class="id">[2505.16853]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model).

After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18), DES and BAO observations.

A promising explanation is the $\nu p$-process, which is posited to operate in the neutrino-driven outflows that form inside core-collapse supernovae after shock revival. While recent studies have analyzed several relevant physical effects that influence the efficiency of this process, the impact of General Relativity (GR) on it remains unexplored. We perform a comparative analysis of the time-integrated $\nu p$-process yields in Newtonian and fully GR calculations, using detailed models of time-evolving outflow profiles. The GR effects are seen to suppress the production of seed nuclei, significantly boosting the resulting $p$-nuclide abundances. Our reference GR model, with an 18 $M_\odot$ progenitor, reproduces both the relative and absolute solar system abundances of the entire set of the $p$ nuclides in the mass range $74\leq A\leq102$. The yields are suboptimal in our 12.75 $M_\odot$ GR model, where the outflow transitions to the supersonic regime several seconds into the explosion, suppressing further $p$-nuclide production. In both models, most of the production of the crucial $^{92,94}{\rm Mo}$ and $^{96,98}{\rm Ru}$ $p$ isotopes occurs relatively early, 1–3 seconds after shock revival. In contrast, a large fraction of the shielded isotope $^{92}{\rm Nb}$ is produced in the subsequent ejecta. The impact of GR on this isotope is especially large, with its final abundance boosted by a factor of 25 compared to a Newtonian calculation. In summary, with the GR effects taken into account, the $\nu p$-process in a sufficiently massive progenitor can provide a unifying explanation for the origin of all $p$ nuclei in the solar system up to $^{102}$Pd.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10755" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside-Out Planet Formation. VIII. Onset of Planet Formation and the Transition Disk Phase</a><span class="id">[2508.10755]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF) is a theory of {\it in situ} formation via pebble accretion of close-in Earth to Super-Earth mass planets at the pressure maximum associated with the dead zone inner boundary (DZIB), whose location is set initially by thermal ionization of alkali metals at $\sim1,200\:$K. With midplane disk temperatures determined by viscous accretional heating, the radial location of the DZIB depends on the accretion rate of the disk. Here, we investigate the ability of pebbles to be trapped at the DZIB as a function of the accretion rate and pebble size. We discuss the conditions that are needed for pebble trapping to become efficient when the accretion rate drops to $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$ and the resulting DZIB is at $\sim 0.1\:$au, which is the expected evolutionary phase of the disk at the onset of IOPF. This provides an important boundary condition for IOPF theory, i.e., the properties of pebbles when planet formation begins. We find for our fiducial model that typical pebble sizes of $\sim0.5\:$mm are needed for pebble trapping to first become efficient at DZIBs near 0.1 au. This model may also provide an explanation for the first emergence of the transition disk phase in protoplanetary disks with accretion rates of $\sim10^{-9}\:M_\odot\:{\rm yr}^{-1}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Highly Eccentric Stellar-Mass Binary Black Holes in Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2510.13066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant fraction of compact-object mergers in galactic nuclei are expected to be eccentric in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) frequency sensitivity range, $10^{-4} - 10^{-1}\ \rm Hz$. Several compact binaries detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration may retain hints of residual eccentricity at $\sim 10$ Hz, suggesting dynamical or triple origins for a significant fraction of the gravitational-wave-observable population. In triple systems, von-Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations perturb both the eccentricity and the argument of pericentre, $\omega$, of the inner black hole binary. The latter could be fully \textit{circulating}, where $\omega$ cycles through $2\pi$, or may \textit{librate}, with $\omega$ ranges about a fixed value with small or large variation. We use \texttt{TSUNAMI}, a regularised N-body code with up to 3.5 post-Newtonian (PN) term corrections, to identify four different families of orbits: (i) circulating, (ii) small and (iii) large amplitude librating, and (iv) merging orbits. We develop and demonstrate a new method to construct gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole formula utilising the instantaneous {\it total} acceleration of each binary component in \texttt{TSUNAMI}. We show that the four orbital families have distinct waveform phenomenologies, enabling them to be distinguished if observed in LISA. The orbits are also distinguishable from an isolated binary or from a binary perturbed by a different tertiary orbit, even if the secular timescale is the same. Future burst timing models will be able to distinguish the different orbital configurations. For efficient binary formation, about $\sim 1000$ binaries can have highly eccentric, librating orbits in the Galactic Centre.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anomalous scattering of pulsars towards the Gum Nebula</a><span class="id">[2510.19388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT.

Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blazar PKS 0446+11 – Neutrino connection study using a lepto-hadronic model</a><span class="id">[2511.07643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-wavelength study of a blazar PKS 0446+11, motivated by its spatial association with the neutrino event IC240105A detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory on 2024 January 5. The source is located 0.4 degrees from the best-fit neutrino direction and satisfies selection criteria for VLBI-selected, radio-bright AGN that have been identified as highly probable neutrino associations. PKS 0446+11 exhibited a major gamma-ray flare in November 2023, reaching approximately 18x its 4FGL-DR4 catalog average. Around the neutrino epoch, PKS 0446+11 remained in an elevated state, with the gamma-ray flux more than six times above its catalog level, the X-ray flux an order of magnitude above the archival measurements, and the optical-UV emission also enhanced. We used Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT, and archival multi-wavelength data to construct multi-wavelength light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). SED modeling shows that the emission is best described by a leptonic scenario, with synchrotron emission at low energies and external Compton scattering of broad-line region and dusty torus photons dominating the X-ray - gamma-ray output. A lepto-hadronic model fails to adequately reproduce the observed SED, although hadronic cascades can broadly account for the X-ray and gamma-ray spectral coverage at lower flux levels. We compute the expected neutrino flux for the hadronic scenario and compare it to the IceCube 90% upper limit. Our results highlight the importance of continued multi-wavelength and neutrino monitoring to better understand the physical conditions under which this blazar may serve as neutrino source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planet Migration in Protoplanetary Disks with Rims</a><span class="id">[2511.21328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates.

With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solitary Alfvén Waves</a><span class="id">[2512.02292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the solitary Alfvén wave, an exact nonlinear solution of the ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations, and construct a three-dimensional numerical model – an \emph{Alfvénon}.

Their relativistic jets, closely aligned to the line of sight from Earth, are a rich and complex environment, characterised by the presence of strong magnetic fields over parsec-scale lengths. Owing to their cosmological distance from Earth, these sources serve as ideal targets to probe non-standard gamma-ray propagation. In particular, axion-like particles (ALPs) could be detected through their coupling to photons, which enables ALP-photon conversions in external magnetic fields, leading to distinct signatures in the blazars' gamma-ray spectra. In this work, we estimate the potential of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to constrain the ALP parameter space by simulating observations of two bright blazars, Mrk 501 and PKS 2155$-$304. We obtain projected $2\sigma$ exclusion regions, demonstrating that CTAO will be able to consistently improve present limits thanks to its greater energy resolution and point-source sensitivity with respect to present ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. In addition to the standard statistical technique based on the likelihood ratio test, we further demonstrate the application of a new method based on machine learning classifiers, which may help in reducing the effect of systematic model-dependent uncertainties in future ALP searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19800" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New and updated timing models for seven young energetic X-ray pulsars, including the Big Glitcher PSR J0537-6910</a><span class="id">[2512.19800]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new timing models and update our previous ones for the rotational evolution of seven young energetic pulsars, including four of the top five in spin-down luminosity Edot among all known pulsars.

Relativistic hydrodynamic solutions of Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion reveal that quantum corrections significantly modify the structure of the shock cone formed around the black hole. The black hole spin controls the azimuthal asymmetry of the shock cone through frame-dragging effects, whereas the quantum correction parameter effectively reduces the strength of gravitational focusing by modifying the metric coefficients in the strong-field region, resulting in a wider shock opening angle, weaker post-shock compression, and reduced density concentration within the cone. Time-dependent mass accretion rates reveal oscillation modes trapped within the shock cone. The power spectral density (PSD) investigations suggest that these modes naturally generate low-frequency QPOs, whose amplitudes, coherence, and harmonic structure depend on both the spin and the quantum correction parameter. The PSD analyses performed at different radial locations reveal that identical QPO frequencies are obtained in all cases. The numerically detected frequencies result from the excitation of global oscillation modes trapped within the post-shock region. The resulting global modes are found to consist of fundamental frequencies, their associated harmonic overtones, and near-commensurate frequency ratios such as 2:1 and 3:2. Coherent oscillations are enhanced and near-commensurate frequency ratios are produced when moderate rotation and moderate quantum corrections are coupled. Large quantum correction parameters, on the other hand, wash out unique spectral peaks and suppress oscillation amplitudes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical mass of a solar-like oscillator at the main-sequence turnoff from Gaia astrometry &amp; ground-based spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2601.14197]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asteroseismology is widely used for precise determining of masses of solar-like oscillating stars by performing individual-frequency modeling or applying homological scaling relations. However, these methods lack dynamical validation on the main sequence due to the absence of eclipsing double-lined binary system (SB2) as benchmark objects. By providing the orbital inclination, astrometric binary systems from ESA Gaia DR3 offer an abundant alternative for eclipsing systems. We present KIC693187 as the first SB2, hosting a solar-like oscillating post-main-sequence star with dynamical masses. By combining Gaia astrometry with spectroscopic obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network (LCO), we find $M_1^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.99$\pm$0.05$M_\odot$ and $M_2^\mathrm{dyn}$=0.89$\pm$0.04$M_\odot$ for the primary and secondary, respectively. Asteroseismic parameters were extracted from photometry of the NASA \Kepler satellite. The mass from individual frequency modeling is $M_1^\mathrm{IF}$=0.92$\pm$0.01$M_\odot$. Taking into account the systematic uncertainty of 0.04$M_\odot$ for best fit models from individual frequency fitting, we find an agreement within 1.2$\sigma$. From scaling relations we obtain a mass range of 0.93 to 0.98$M_\odot$ by using the observed large frequency separations (\dnu) in the scaling relations for the primary. By using standard corrections for departures from the asymptotic regime of \dnu, we obtained a mass range of 0.83 to 1.03$M_\odot$. The upper ends of both ranges agree well with the dynamical mass of the primary. This approach provides the first empirical validation for main-sequence solar-like oscillators and opens a new window for validating asteroseismology. Through a dedicatded program targeting astrometric SB2 binary systems, ESA's PLATO space mission will provide will enlarge the benchmark sample substantially.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutron star cooling implications and magnetic field of the Vela Junior central compact object from all XMM-Newton and Chandra spectra</a><span class="id">[2601.14388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The central compact object (CCO) in the Vela Junior supernova remnant is a young neutron star whose relatively low X-ray flux and small distance suggest it has a mass high enough to activate fast neutrino cooling processes. Here we analyse all XMM-Newton MOS and pn and Chandra ACIS-S spectra of the Vela Junior CCO, with observations taking place over the 9 years from 2001 to 2010. We find that the best-fit flux and spectral model parameters do not vary significantly when treating each observation independently, and therefore we fit all the spectra simultaneously using various spectral models to characterize the predominantly thermal emission from the neutron star surface. Our results indicate the Vela Junior CCO has an atmosphere composed of hydrogen, a hot spot temperature (unredshifted) of 3.5x10^6 K, and a colder surface temperature of (6.6-8.8)x10^5 K. Possible absorption lines at  0.6 keV and 0.9 keV provide evidence for the first-time of an average surface magnetic field B 3x10^10 G for this CCO, which is similar to the magnetic field of other CCOs. At the accurate new Vela Junior distance of 1.4 kpc, the observed luminosity that is dominated by the hot spot is  5x10^32 erg s^-1. The luminosity from the rest of the colder surface is (1.3-4.0)x10^32 erg s^-1. The cool luminosity and temperature imply the Vela Junior CCO is indeed colder than many other young neutron stars and probably has a high mass that triggered fast neutrino cooling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</a><span class="id">[2601.17938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How well is the local Large Scale Structure of the Universe known? CosmicFlows vs. Biteau's Galaxy Catalog with Cloning</a><span class="id">[2601.20808]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes, for instance as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse dark matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in unseen galaxies. Here we compare the density field proposed by J. Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Y. Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (A. Valade 2026). We find factor-of-two level differences in some regions and even larger discrepancies toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA), defined by absolute longitude less than 30 degrees and absolute latitude less than 20 degrees, as filled by Biteau using cloning. Within 11 Mpc the density field is well determined by the Local Volume catalog (I. D. Karachentsev et al. 2018), which is directly incorporated by Biteau, and is preferred over the CosmicFlows modeling. At larger distances Biteau (2021) is also preferred for the direction and integrated mass of non-obscured structures, but the radial mass distribution is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. Within the ZoA the galaxies of Biteau (2021) are entirely fictitious and their use is ill advised except where they do not contribute to the observable of interest. Moreover, as shown by the South Pole Wall, discovered by CosmicFlows but absent from galaxy catalogs, obscuration can be significant even outside the ZoA. Unexpectedly, we find that the angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes misaligned with their true positions as seen in galaxy catalogs outside the ZoA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isotropic Equivalence of STVG–MOG and $Λ$CDM and Its Breakdown in Large–Scale Anisotropic Cosmological Observables</a><span class="id">[2601.22207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing displaced (dark)photons from low reheating freeze-in at the LHC</a><span class="id">[2507.15930]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)'$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens</a><span class="id">[2507.20323]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, such FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8\times10^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor compounding over such large magnification zone results in a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background. That level of antisotropy is out of the sensitivity, $&lt;20\%$, of the pulsar timing arrays today.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergent Turbulence in Nonlinear Gravity</a><span class="id">[2508.13294]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravity in nonlinear and dynamical regimes underpins spectacular astrophysical phenomena and observable consequences, from the early universe to black hole collisions. In these extreme environments, inverse energy cascades - mediated by nonlinear interactions - may help explain the near scale-invariance of cosmic structure and the simplicity of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Yet the presence, characteristics, and generality of such interactions in full General Relativity remain largely unexplored. Here we show that two types of nonlinear interactions - a four-mode and a three-mode interaction - emerge in the fully nonlinear regime, and can indeed channel inverse energy cascades by inducing resonant and anti-damping instabilities. This establishes what was previously only hinted at in highly specialized perturbative contexts. We further demonstrate a “laminar” to “turbulent” transition for the largest-possible angular structure in General Relativity, whereas finer structures remain persistently turbulent. Our results reveal the impact and generality of these nonlinear interactions (instabilities), which can be key to understanding observations ranging from cosmological to kilometer scales. We anticipate that our work will shed new light on nonlinear gravitational phenomena and their consequences, such as constructing gravitational wave templates and testing General Relativity in the most extreme regime. Moreover, our work is a starting point for addressing nonlinear gravitational interactions using ideas and methods inspired by fluid dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noninflationary solution to the monopole problem</a><span class="id">[2509.23726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic monopoles are a long-standing prediction of Grand Unified Theories, yet their efficient production in early universe phase transitions would lead to a monopole abundance that far exceeds observational limits.

Here, we propose an alternative solution based on the breaking, in the early universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, of the Weyl conformal symmetry of the gauge kinetic sector of the Lagrangian. This mechanism enhances monopole annihilation, thereby reducing their abundance to acceptable levels without requiring inflation. This scenario also predicts a residual flux of GUT monopoles potentially within the sensitivity of current and upcoming cosmic ray detectors, making their discovery possible in the near future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows</a><span class="id">[2510.03141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field.

On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfvénic, raising the possibility that shear-driven turbulence may be found even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations.

Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</a><span class="id">[2510.07894]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry.

This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify–for the first time–the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be  15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to  50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can–in some cases–result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase space analysis of an exponential model in $f(Q)$ gravity including linear dark-sector interactions</a><span class="id">[2510.12020]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism.
