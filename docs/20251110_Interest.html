<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25276" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Particles before symmetry</a><span class="id">[2509.25276]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Standard Model of particle physics is usually cast in symmetry-first terms. On this approach, one begins with a symmetry group and postulates matter fields as objects transforming under its representations, without requiring that the group be grounded in, or derived from, independent geometric structures. Recently, a geometry-first formulation has been proposed, in which the relevant symmetries are not fundamental. In this paper I extend this approach to two central mechanisms of the Standard Model: spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Yukawa coupling, both essential for particles to acquire mass. These reformulations offer alternative explanations cast in purely geometric terms. In particular, the quantisation of charge arises here as a purely geometric consequence of the tensorial construction of matter fields from the fundamental bundles – a mechanism that is both more general and more transparent than the usual topological account based on the compactness of symmetry groups. More generally, I argue that a symmetry-first account in terms of principal and associated bundles admits a genuine geometry-first counterpart only under certain strict conditions.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CATS: Empowering the next generation of rocket scientists through educational flight computers</a><span class="id">[2511.04725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the Vega flight computer, and its corresponding ground station developed by CATS, a company producing open-source flight computers and tracking systems tailored for student-made rockets. These flight computers, designed to support rockets reaching altitudes of up to 30 km and possibly higher, play a crucial role in advancing educational rocketry and facilitating hands-on learning experiences in aerospace engineering. As the official sponsor of the European Rocketry Challenge (EuRoC), these flight computers have become integral to the competition, providing reliable and sophisticated telemetry and control capabilities that enhance both safety and performance. The paper delves into the technical specifications and educational impact of these systems, highlighting their contribution to the broader European rocketry programmes. Through comprehensive field data and case studies from the recent European Rocketry Challenge, this study underscores the potential of open-source flight computers to inspire the next generation of aerospace professionals.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainty quantification and parameter optimization of plasma etching process using heteroscedastic Gaussian process</a><span class="id">[2511.04990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study presents a comprehensive framework for uncertainty quantification (UQ) and design optimization of plasma etching in semiconductor manufacturing. The framework is demonstrated using experimental measurements of etched depth collected at nine wafer locations under various plasma conditions. A heteroscedastic Gaussian process (hetGP) surrogate model is employed to capture the complex uncertainty structure in the data, enabling distinct quantification of (a) spatial variability across the wafer and (b) process-related uncertainty arising from variations in chamber pressure, gas flow rate, and RF power. Epistemic uncertainty due to sparse data is further quantified and incorporated into a reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) scheme. The proposed method identifies optimal process parameters that minimize spatial variability of etch depth while maintaining reliability under both aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. The results demonstrate that this framework effectively integrates data-driven surrogate modeling with robust optimization, enhancing predictive accuracy and process reliability. Moreover, the proposed approach is generalizable to other semiconductor processes, such as photolithography, where performance is highly sensitive to multifaceted uncertainties.</p></div></details></article></body>
