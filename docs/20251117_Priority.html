In this case, the higher the variations of $L_z$ of the orbit over a certain period of time, the higher the chaos of the orbit. In essence, a new method for analyzing orbital dynamics – regular or chaotic – is proposed. A high level of correlation between the results of orbit classification by the proposed method and the results of classification by other methods is shown. As a result, a sample of 45 globular clusters in the central region of the Galaxy with a radius of 3.5 kpc is divided into regular, chaotic, and weakly chaotic.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reaching for the Edge II: Stellar Halos out to Large Radii as a Tracer of Dark Matter Halo Mass</a><span class="id">[2511.10723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The diffuse outskirts of brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) encode valuable information about the assembly history and mass of their host dark matter halos. However, the low surface brightness of these stellar halos has historically made them difficult to observe. Recent deep imaging, particularly with Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC), has shown that the stellar mass within relatively large projected annuli, such as within $50$ and $100$ kpc, is a promising proxy for halo mass. However, the optimal radial definition of this &quot;outskirt mass&quot; remains uncertain. We construct an HSC-like mock observing pipeline to measure the stellar mass density profiles of BCGs in the IllustrisTNG simulations. Our mock observations closely reproduce HSC profiles across six orders of magnitude in surface density. We then systematically measure stellar masses within different annuli and how tightly they are connected to halo mass. We find that stellar masses measured within simple apertures exhibit considerably more scatter in the stellar mass-halo mass relation than those measured within projected ellipsoidal annuli. We identify an optimal range of definitions, with inner radii between $\sim 70$-$200$ kpc and outer radii between $\sim 125$-$500$ kpc. We also introduce two halo-mass-dependent Sérsic models for the average stellar halo profiles. We present a Sérsic-based fitting function that describes the profiles as a function of the halo mass, $M_{\rm vir}$, with a median error of $54\%$. Adding the central stellar mass of the BCG as a second parameter slightly improves the accuracy to a median error of $39\%$. Together, these results provide fitting functions for BCG stellar halos that can be applied to future wide-field surveys to infer halo masses from deep imaging data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Back to basics: Little Red Dots as galaxies and dust-obscured AGNs in a synthetic NIRCam sky simulated with L-GalaxiesBH</a><span class="id">[2511.10725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The enigmatic Little Red Dots (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) exhibit properties challenging their interpretation as common galaxies or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Understanding their nature is key to placing them within our picture of early galaxy and massive black hole (MBH) evolution. To this aim, we build a realistic comparison between LRD observations with photometric properties of galaxies and AGN simulated by the L-GalaxiesBH model in a NIRCam mock sky. We model stellar continua and emission lines, the MBH emission from accretion disk, infrared radiation from dusty torus, and lines from narrow and broad line regions, accounting for dust attenuation and obscuration. Using realistic photometric cuts, we select a population of LRDs including both AGN and galaxies. The LRD fraction peaks at 40% ($\sim10^{-4}\rm Mpc^{-3}$) at $z\sim4$. Our LRDs are central galaxies spanning $M_*=10^8-10^{10.5}\rm M_\odot$. A population of galaxies with $M_*&lt;10^9\rm M_\odot$ appear as LRDs due to older stellar populations. At higher masses, LRDs dominate the halo and stellar mass functions ($M_{\rm vir} &gt; 10^{11.5}\rm M_\odot$, $M_* &gt; 10^{9.5}\rm M_\odot$), and the interplay between AGN and galaxy emission drives the LRD selection. AGN dominate rest-frame UV-optical emission, while dust obscuration is secondary. LRDs host lighter MBHs ($\sim 10^{6.5}\rm M_\odot$) than non-LRDs ($\sim 10^{7.5}\rm M_\odot$), with fainter emission unable to balance their hosts Balmer breaks. We find no evidence for dominant heavy-seed origin of MBHs. LRD Galaxies (97% hosting MBHs) and LRD AGNs are disk-dominated, with LRD AGNs showing larger bulges formed mainly via disk instabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large-Scale Structure in COSMOS-Web: Tracing Galaxy Evolution in the Cosmic Web up to $z \sim 7$ with the Largest JWST Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.10727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a reconstruction of the large-scale structure using the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) COSMOS-Web program to trace environmentally driven galaxy evolution up to $z\sim7$. We applied a weighted kernel density estimation method to 160,000 galaxies with robust photometric redshifts. We find that stellar mass has a positive correlation with density at all redshifts, stronger for quiescent galaxies (QGs) at $z\lesssim2.5$, while at higher redshifts ($2.5\lesssim z\lesssim5.5$) this trend is confined to extreme overdense environments, consistent with early mass assembly in proto-clusters. The star-formation rate (SFR) shows a negative trend with density for QGs at $z\lesssim1.2$, reversing at $z\gtrsim1.8$, while star-forming galaxies (SFGs) show a mild positive correlation up to $z\sim5.5$. The specific SFR remains nearly flat for SFGs and declines with density for QGs at $z\lesssim1.2$. Moreover, mass and environmental quenching efficiencies show that mass-driven processes dominate at $z\gtrsim2.5$, the two processes act with comparable strength between $0.8\lesssim z\lesssim2.5$, and environmental quenching becomes stronger for low-mass galaxies ($M_\star\lesssim10^{10} M_\odot$) at $z\lesssim0.8$. These findings reveal that large-scale structure drives galaxy evolution by enhancing early mass assembly in dense regions and increasingly suppressing star formation in low-mass systems at later times, establishing the environmental role of the cosmic web across cosmic history. COSMOS-Web, the largest JWST survey, provides accurate and deep photometric redshifts, reaching 80% mass completeness at $\log(M_\star/M_\odot)\sim8.7$ at $z\sim7$, enabling the first view of how environments shaped galaxy evolution from the epoch of reionization to the present day.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The signature of major mergers on the hydrostatic mass bias of galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2511.10730]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While galaxy cluster masses are fundamental cosmological observables, estimates based on intra-cluster medium observations rely on hydrostatic equilibrium, introducing a systematic bias. We investigate how mergers drive the time evolution of this hydrostatic mass bias, identifying the dominant physical mechanisms and their dependence on dynamical state and merger history. Using a high-resolution AMR Eulerian+$N$-body cosmological simulation, we analyse a sample of cluster mergers within $1.5 \leq z \leq 0$, comparing true and hydrostatic masses derived from gas density and temperature profiles, and tracing their evolution. At $z=0$, the hydrostatic mass bias shows a mild correlation with dynamical state. During major mergers, the bias follows a characteristic trend: a sharp negative dip around the merger time, a transient positive peak, and a gradual return to pre-merger levels. This behaviour is primarily driven by morphological and dynamical reconfigurations of the gas density within the ICM, while thermodynamical processes play a secondary role. The pattern shows no strong dependence on secondary parameters, such as mass ratio or impact parameter, but it can be fitted to a simple time-dependent functional form. This trend is present at radii $r\le R_{\mathrm{vir}}$, although with reduced amplitude and shorter timescales as the radius decreases. Hydrostatic mass bias is closely linked, albeit in a non-trivial way, with the merging history of galaxy clusters. We find that the bias values are weakly correlated with the dynamical state of clusters. Nevertheless, our results give a robust estimation of the hydrostatic mass bias values in the pre-merger, merging, and post-merger phases. These findings highlight the importance of delving deeper into the observational assessment of cluster assembly state in order to improve mass estimations for cosmological analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Quiescent Merging Nature of the Coma Cluster Revealed by ICM Velocity Structure</a><span class="id">[2511.10740]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The hot gas permeating galaxy clusters-the intracluster medium (ICM)-is a key tracer of their assembly history and internal dynamics. Understanding the motion of this gas provides critical insight into processes such as mergers, turbulence, and energy dissipation in the largest gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. The Coma cluster is a nearby, massive system long suspected to be dynamically disturbed. Previous high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the XRISM mission revealed bulk motions in the cluster core and southern regions. Here we present new XRISM Resolve observations of a northern region in Coma, which reveal a coherent velocity gradient of nearly $530 km/s across the cluster from south to north. We find that the hot gas in this northern region exhibits modest line-of-sight motions and uniform thermodynamic properties, indicating relatively mild local disturbances. The consistent levels of turbulence throughout the cluster suggest that the energy from a past merger has been distributed on large scales. These findings provide compelling evidence for an off-axis merger event and demonstrate how high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy can uncover subtle dynamical signatures in the ICM, offering important constraints for simulations of cluster evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10741" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REBELS-IFU: Steeply rising star formation histories and the importance of dust obscuration in massive $z \simeq7$ galaxies revealed by multi-wavelength observations</a><span class="id">[2511.10741]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reliable star formation rate (SFR) measurements are essential for understanding early galaxy evolution, yet derived values rely on several assumptions. To address this problem, we investigate the SFRs of 12 massive ($9~&lt;~\log(M_{\star}/{\rm M}_{\odot})~&lt;~10$) Lyman-break galaxies at $z=6.5-7.7$, drawn from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) program. The multi-wavelength data, including JWST NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy and ALMA observations, make this a unique sample for investigating SFR tracers at this epoch. We compare SFRs derived from the rest-UV, H$\alpha$, and far-infrared emission, and from spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We apply robust dust attenuation corrections, which are crucial since between $50-80$ per cent of the star formation is obscured, and find a stellar-to-nebular attenuation ratio of $f=0.50\pm0.08$, consistent with local star-forming galaxies. The majority of the derived total SFRs (medians $25-120$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) place the REBELS galaxies systematically above $z=7$ literature star-forming main-sequence relations, and our best-fit star formation histories (SFHs) rise more steeply than lower-mass galaxies at the same redshift. We show that these rising SFHs mean commonly used luminosity-to-SFR conversion factors, derived assuming a constant SFH over given timescales, overestimate the SFRs averaged over these timescales for our galaxies. We provide updated luminosity-to-SFR calibrations for $z\simeq7$ galaxies with rising SFHs, showing that commonly assumed rest-UV conversion factors overestimate the $100$ Myr average SFR by a factor of $\simeq3$. Finally, we investigate burstiness indicators in the REBELS-IFU galaxies, finding that the rising SFHs imply that the H$\alpha$-to-UV luminosity ratio is an unreliable probe of bursty star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REBELS-IFU: Spatially Resolved Ionizing Photon Production Efficiencies of 12 Bright Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2511.10743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measuring the ionizing photon production efficiency $\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ – the ratio of ionizing photon output rate $Q_{\rm H^0}$ to UV continuum luminosity $L_{\rm UV}$ – in galaxies at $z &gt; 6$ is crucial for constraining their contribution to cosmic reionization. We present integrated and spatially resolved measurements of $\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ for 12 exceptionally bright ($M_\mathrm{UV} \sim -22$ mag) star-forming galaxies at $z \sim 7$ from the REBELS survey. These measurements are based on JWST NIRSpec/IFU PRISM spectroscopy, probing the rest-frame UV and optical regime. Notably, in 8 of the 12 galaxies, the spectral coverage includes H$\alpha$, enabling self-consistent dust attenuation estimates in both the ionized gas and stellar continuum via the Balmer decrement and rest-UV slope, respectively. We find global $\log\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ values ranging from $25.19\pm0.11$ to $25.61\pm0.11$, with a weighted mean of $25.44\pm0.15$, consistent with the canonical value of $\sim25.3$. Using a sample of 25 star-forming clumps within these galaxies, we explore local variations in LyC production efficiency, finding a broader range, from $24.52\pm0.21$ to $26.18\pm0.61$. We identify strong correlations between $\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ and specific star formation rate, star formation surface density, H$\beta$ equivalent width, and stellar mass. Clumps with the highest $\xi_{\mathrm{ion,0}}$ exhibit $\mathrm{EW}_0(\mathrm{H}\beta) \ge 150$ Angstrom, consistent with young stellar ages. From previous Ly$\alpha$ measurements in three galaxies, we estimate a typical Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc, Ly\alpha} \sim 2\%$, suggesting similar or lower escape fractions for LyC photons. Combining this with our H$\alpha$ measurements, we infer ionized bubble sizes $\sim 1$ pMpc, aligned with expectations from Ly$\alpha$-detected systems and reionization models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dawes Review 13: A New Look at The Dynamic Radio Sky</a><span class="id">[2511.10785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astronomical objects that change rapidly give us insight into extreme environments, allowing us to identify new phenomena, test fundamental physics, and probe the Universe on all scales. Transient and variable radio sources range from the cosmological, such as gamma-ray bursts, to much more local events, such as massive flares from stars in our Galactic neighbourhood. The capability to observe the sky repeatedly, over many frequencies and timescales, has allowed us to explore and understand dynamic phenomena in a way that has not been previously possible. In the past decade, there have been great strides forward as we prepared for the revolution in time domain radio astronomy that is being enabled by the SKA Observatory telescopes, the SKAO pathfinders and precursors, and other `next generation' radio telescopes. Hence it is timely to review the current status of the field, and summarise the developments that have happened to get to our current point. This review focuses on image domain (or `slow') transients, on timescales of seconds to years. We discuss the physical mechanisms that cause radio variability, and the classes of radio transients that result. We then outline what an ideal image domain radio transients survey would look like, and summarise the history of the field, from targeted observations to surveys with existing radio telescopes. We discuss methods and approaches for transient discovery and classification, and identify some of the challenges in scaling up current methods for future telescopes. Finally, we present our current understanding of the dynamic radio sky, in terms of source populations and transient rates, and look at what we can expect from surveys on future radio telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10794" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of supermassive black holes on exoplanet habitability: I. Spanning the natural mass range</a><span class="id">[2511.10794]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the influence of supermassive black hole (SMBH) activity on habitability has garnered attention, the specific effects of active galactic nuclei (AGN) winds, particularly ultrafast outflows (UFOs), on planetary atmospheres remain largely unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating the relationship between SMBH mass at the galactic center and exoplanetary habitability, given that SMBH masses are empirically confirmed to span approximately 5 orders of magnitude in galaxies. Through simplified models, we account for various results involving the relationships between the distance from the planet to the central SMBH and the mass of the SMBH. Specifically, we show that increased SMBH mass leads to higher atmospheric heating and elevated temperatures, greater molecular thermal velocities, and enhanced mass loss, all of which diminish with distance from the galactic center. Energy-driven winds consistently have a stronger impact than momentum-driven ones. Crucially, ozone depletion is shown to rise with SMBH mass and decrease with distance from the galactic center, with nearly complete ozone loss ($\sim100\%$) occurring across galactic scales for SMBHs $\geq 10^8 M_\odot$ in the energy-driven case. This study emphasizes that SMBH growth over cosmic time may have produced markedly different impacts on galactic habitability, depending on both the mass of the central black hole (BH) and the location of planetary systems within their host galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mock Observations for the CSST Mission: Main Surveys – the Mock Catalogue</a><span class="id">[2511.10805]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is a flagship space mission, designed to carry out a large-area sky survey to explore the nature of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe. The onboard multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic modules will enable us to obtain photometric data for billions of galaxies and stars, as well as hundreds of millions of spectroscopic measurements, advancing various scientific analyses such as galaxy clustering and weak gravitational lensing. To support the image simulations for the main survey of the CSST mission, we present a mock catalogue of stars and galaxies. For stars, the mock catalogue is generated using either Galaxia or TRILEGAL, both of which provide a range of stellar properties to meet the requirements of CSST image simulations. For galaxies, we built a mock light-cone up to redshift z 3.5 from the cosmological Nbody simulation and populated the mock galaxy catalogue from the dark mater haloes using a semi-analytical galaxy formation model. We then performed a full-sky ray-tracing simulation of weak gravitational lensing to obtain lensing shear at the position of each galaxy in the light-cone. To support both multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic simulations, we computed the spectral energy distribution (SED) for each galaxy based on its star formation history using a supervised deep-learning model and determined the magnitudes in each band using the CSST throughputs. Finally, the properties of our mock galaxies include positions, redshifts, stellar masses, shapes, sizes, SEDs, lensing shears and magnifications. We have validated our mock catalogue against observational data and theoretical models, with results showing good overall agreement. The catalogue provides a flexible dataset for the development of CSST image processing and can support a wide range of cosmological analyses within the CSST mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALMAGAL V. Relations between the core populations and the parent clump physical properties</a><span class="id">[2511.10825]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. The fragmentation of massive molecular clumps into smaller, potentially star-forming cores plays a key role in the processes of high-mass star formation. The ALMAGAL project offers high-resolution data to investigate these processes across various evolutionary stages in the Galactic plane. Aims. This study aims at correlating the fragmentation properties of massive clumps, obtained from ALMA observations, with their global physical parameters (e.g., mass, surface density, and temperature) and evolutionary indicators (such as luminosity-to-mass ratio and bolometric temperature) obtained from Herschel observations. It seeks to assess whether the cores evolve in number and mass in tandem with their host clumps, and to determine the possible factors influencing the formation of massive cores (M &gt; 24M_\odot). Methods. We analyzed the masses of 6348 fragments, estimated from 1.4 mm continuum data for 1007 ALMAGAL clumps. Leveraging this unprecedentedly large data set, we evaluated statistical relationships between clump parameters, estimated over about 0.1 pc scales, and fragment properties, corresponding to scales of a few 1000 au, while accounting for potential biases related to distance and observational resolution. Our results were further compared with predictions from numerical simulations. Results. The fragmentation level correlates preferentially with clump surface density, supporting a scenario of density-driven fragmentation, whereas it does not show any clear dependence on total clump mass. Both the mass of the most massive core and the core formation efficiency show a broad range and increase on average by an order of magnitude in the intervals spanned by evolutionary indicators such as clump dust temperature and the luminosity-to-mass ratio. This suggests that core growth continues throughout the clump evolution, favoring clump-fed over core-fed theoretical scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10882" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the Chemical Complexity and C/O Ratio of the HD 163296 Protoplanetary Disk: Constraints from Multi-line ALMA Observations of Organics, Nitriles, Sulfur-bearing, and Deuterated Molecules</a><span class="id">[2511.10882]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The physical and chemical conditions within a protoplanetary disk play a crucial role in determining its chemical composition, which is subsequently inherited by any forming planets. To probe these conditions, high-resolution molecular line observations, coupled with modelling, are essential. In this study, we investigate the chemistry of the nearby, massive, and relatively line-rich protoplanetary disk around HD 163296 using high-resolution observations from ALMA across Bands 3, 4, 6, and 7. We constrain the disk-averaged and radial distributions of column density and excitation temperature for the detected molecules using the new retrieval code DRive. The disk chemistry is modelled using the astrochemical code PEGASIS, with variations in the initial elemental C/O ratio. Our modelling, informed by molecular observations of HCO+, DCO+, HCN, DCN, CS, HC3N, H2CO, CH3OH, HNCO, and NH2CHO, allows us to place strong constraints on the C/O ratio, with a best-fit value of 1.1 that is broadly consistent with previous estimates. We present the highest-resolution DCO+ emission map of this disk to date, revealing triple-ringed chemical substructures that closely align with the dust continuum rings. Additionally, our results provide the first and most stringent upper limits on the column densities of NH2CHO and HNCO in this protoplanetary disk, measured at &lt; 7e11 cm-2 and &lt; 1e11 cm-2, respectively. Our chemical models suggest that NH2CHO and HNCO predominantly form on grain surfaces within the disk. However, physico-chemical desorption mechanisms are inefficient at releasing these species into detectable gas-phase abundances, yet they remain promising targets for future ALMA observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10927" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PRIMA General Observer Science Book Volume 2</a><span class="id">[2511.10927]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) mission concept is a proposed mission to NASA's Astrophysics Probe Explorer (APEX) call.

The filamentary structure is found in a model-independent manner in both topological features and Gaussian Gradient Magnitude filtering. The X-ray surface brightness profile perpendicular to the filament is detected at a $5.5\sigma$ level. Weak-lensing (WL) analysis using the Subaru/HSC-SSP Survey archive data strongly supports the two mass components. Given a prior from the stellar masses, we obtain $M_{200}^{\rm main}=2.68_{-0.92}^{+1.11}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and $M_{200}^{\rm sub}=0.46_{-0.22}^{+0.38}\times 10^{14}\,h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. The main axis of the projected halo distribution is more likely to align with the direction of the main cluster than to be oriented perpendicularly. Similar X-ray distributions have been identified in the literature on numerical simulations. The filamentary structure forms in the following manner: as the gas is stripped by ram pressure near the pericenter, it gets dragged by tidal rotation. Once free from this rotation, the gas moves inertially in a direction parallel to the tangential velocity at the pericenter. The comma-shaped gas, with tails pointing in the opposite direction to the main cluster, is also formed by the current tidal rotation as it moves away from the main cluster. This warrants us that, although it is sometimes thought based on the X-ray morphology alone that the tail is pointing in the opposite direction to the merger motion, this is not necessarily the case. The information of the X-ray filamentary remnant from the cluster merger, together with the 2D WL shear data, provides constraints on the merger parameters, indicating an infalling velocity of approximately $1000\, {\rm km\, s^{-1}}$ and an impact parameter of $0.9$ Mpc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Spatial Evolution of Star Clusters in NGC 628 with JWST</a><span class="id">[2511.11115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the spatial distribution of star clusters in NGC 628 using the statistical tool INDICATE to quantify clustering tendencies. Our sample, based on HST and JWST observations, is the most complete to date, spanning ages from 1 Myr to &gt;100 Myr. We find cluster spatial behaviour varies with galactic position, age, and mass. Most emerging young clusters are tightly spatially associated with each other, while fully emerged clusters are in \sim1.5 times looser spatial associations, irrespective of age. Young Massive Clusters (YMCs \ge 10^4 M_{\odot}) tend to associate with lower-mass clusters but not strongly with other YMCs, implying that intense star formation regions produce a few YMCs alongside many lower-mass clusters rather than multiple YMCs together. Young concentrated clusters show a wide radial distribution in the galactic disk, which narrows with age; with concentrated clusters &gt;100 Myr mostly residing between 2-6 kpc. This pattern may reflect either faster dispersal of isolated tight cluster spatial &quot;structure&quot; in a lower gas density outer disk or gradual inside-out growth, with the formation of this structure shifting outward over time. We also detect distinct spatial behaviours for clusters within 2 kpc, linked to the inner Lindblad resonance (\le1 kpc), nuclear ring (\sim0.5-1 kpc), and the start of spiral arms (\sim1.25-2 kpc), suggesting these regions exhibit strong radial motions that could hinder clusters from forming and remaining in tight concentrations. Our results highlight how spatially-resolved studies of clusters can reveal the influence of galactic dynamics on star formation and cluster evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulations of Population III star formation during the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2511.11314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological simulations find that pockets of star-forming gas could remain pristine up until the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) due to the inhomogeneous nature of metal mixing and enrichment in the early Universe. Such pristine clouds could have formed Population III stars, which could have distinct properties compared to their very high redshift ($z \geq 20$) counterparts. We investigate how Population III stars form and grow during the EoR, and whether the resulting mass distribution varies with environment or across cosmic time. We perform high-resolution ($7.5\,\rm{au}$) radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations of identical primordial clouds exposed to the CMB appropriate for $z=30$ and $z=6$, respectively, as part of the POPSICLE project. We also run a simulation at $z=6$ with a strong external Lyman-Werner (LW) background, to span across radiative environments which could host metal-free clumps during the EoR. In the limit of no external LW radiation, we find that while the evolution of the most massive star ($M_{\star} \approx 70\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) is almost identical between $z=30$ and $z=6$, the latter exhibits less fragmentation, leading to a smaller cluster of stars with a higher median stellar mass. In the limit of high external LW radiation, we see vigorous accretion and high star formation efficiencies, leading to the formation of very massive ($M_{\star} &gt; 100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) stars. Our results suggest that Population III IMF could vary with redshift simply due to the CMB, independent of the environment. We find that less massive and more compact Pop III star clusters could form during the EoR as compared to $z \geq 20$, with the formation of very massive and supermassive stars likely in strongly irradiated environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11358" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow-Induced Warps in Protoplanetary disks</a><span class="id">[2511.11358]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Shadows are commonly observed in protoplanetary disks in near-infrared and (sub)millimeter images, often cast by misaligned inner disks or other obscuring material. While recent studies show that shadows can alter disk dynamics, only the case symmetric across the midplane (e.g., from a polar-aligned inner disk) has been studied. Here we study shadows cast by an inner disk with a $30^\circ$ mutual inclination using 3D radiation-hydrodynamical simulations. Given the same shadow shape and amplitude, the $30^\circ$ inclined shadow leads to a much stronger accretion compared with the polar case, reaching $\alpha \sim$ 1, because the disk is squeezed twice in one azimuth, leading to shocks and strong radial flows near the midplane. The outer disk develops a warp: the inner disk region tilts toward alignment with the shadow, while the outer, exponentially tapered disk tilts and twists in a different direction, inclined $\sim$ 32$^\circ$ relative to the inner region. Locally isothermal simulations with a prescribed temperature structure reproduce the effect, confirming that it is thermally driven. Fourier-Hermite analysis shows that it is the m=1, n=1 temperature perturbation that drives the warp by launching bending waves, with the tilting response of the disk approximately proportional to the modal amplitude. This mode always exists unless the shadow is coplanar or polar. Given a fixed temperature contrast, the m=1,n=1 mode peaks at $\sim$15$^\circ$ mutual inclination, but still contributes substantially across 3$^\circ$ to 30$^\circ$. Shadows cause disk warps–they are not only a consequence of them. We discuss testable predictions for current and future ALMA and NIR observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11432" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star clusters in the gamma-ray sky</a><span class="id">[2511.11432]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as additional contributors to Galactic Cosmic rays (CRs), to overcome the limitations of supernova remnants (SNRs) to reach the highest energy end of the CR spectrum. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies, and their energetics is enough to account for a non-negligible fraction of the Galactic CRs. Anyhow, the theoretical expectations need to be corroborated by clear observations. Despite the increasing number of detections at different energies, the contamination of other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from stellar winds only, unless one selects objects younger than a few million years, namely before stars start to explode inside clusters.

Analysing their luminosity-specific number density across galaxies of different morphologies has also shown hints that they may be used as tracers of the age and metallicity of stellar populations. A proper understanding of this relation has been hindered by the fact that simultaneously detecting PNe and accurately measuring stellar properties is extremely difficult using classical narrow-band imaging methods, which cannot detect PNe in the bright centres of galaxies. In this work, we use integral-field spectroscopy to overcome this challenge, analysing the inner regions of a sample of ten early-type galaxies from the Extended Planetary Nebulae Survey (ePN.S) for which archival MUSE data was available. With the Diffuse Emission-Line Filter (DELF) technique, we automate the detection of PNe, and perform spectral fitting on the diffuse light to infer kinematics and stellar population parameters. We compare the PN number density profile and its associated alpha-parameter with multiple properties of the host galaxies. We find that our sample follows the previously observationally constrained correlation with the metallicity of the host galaxy. We find a weak anti-correlation between the alpha-parameter and the FUV excess, highlighting the possible relation between the visibility lifetime of PNe on the spectral energy distribution of their host galaxies, with fewer PNe detected in association with stellar populations characterized by a UV excess.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11501" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer II.

We reconstruct the evolution of the near-IR CIB anisotropies on sub-arcminute scales by known galaxy populations. This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $&lt; 10\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $\lambda &lt;2\ \mu$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Survival of higher overdensity cold gas in a turbulent, multiphase medium</a><span class="id">[2507.20962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cold gas clouds embedded in a hot, turbulent medium are expected to be short-lived due to disruptive hydrodynamic instabilities.

Deep surveys have enabled the study of these objects down to the low surface brightness (LSB) regime. In this paper, we estimate Euclid's dwarf detection capabilities as well as limits of its MERge processing function (MER pipeline), which is responsible for producing the stacked mosaics and final catalogues. To do this, we injected mock dwarf galaxies in a real Euclid Wide Survey (EWS) field in the VIS band and compared the input catalogue to the final MER catalogue. The mock dwarf galaxies were generated using simple Sersic models with structural parameters (including size and surface brightness) drawn from observed dwarf galaxy catalogues. These simulations represent an idealised case in the sense they do not account for additional factors such as ellipticity, morphology, or crowding. To characterise the detected dwarfs, we used the mean surface brightness inside the effective radius SB_e (in mag arcsec^-2). The final MER catalogues achieve completenesses of 91% for SB_e in [21,24] and 54% for SB_e in [24,28]. These numbers do not take into account possible contaminants, including confusion with background galaxies at the location of the dwarfs. After taking those effects into account, they respectively became 86% and 38%. The MER pipeline performs a final local background subtraction with a small mesh size, leading to a flux loss for galaxies with R_e &gt; 10 arcsec. By using the final MER mosaics and reinjecting this local background, we obtained an image in which we recover reliable photometric properties for objects under the arcminute scale. This background-reinjected product is thus suitable for the study of Local Universe dwarf galaxies. Euclid's data reduction pipeline serves as a test bed for other deep surveys, particularly regarding background subtraction methods, a key issue in LSB science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25070" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interstellar Dust-Catalyzed Molecular Hydrogen Formation Enabled by Nuclear Quantum Effects</a><span class="id">[2509.25070]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) plays a critical role in astrophysical processes from galaxy evolution to the formation of planets. While the dominant formation channel in the interstellar medium is considered as dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, this process could become inefficient at low temperatures suppressed by the Boltzmann factor. This work demonstrates that quantum tunneling can dominate the formation of H$_2$, resolving the long-standing problem of formation efficiency. Path integral Monte Carlo simulations reveals that the quantum tunneling of hydrogen atoms maintains stable reaction rates at temperatures below 50 K on both graphitic and silicate grain surfaces. Kinetic Monte Carlo calculations further indicate that the actual H$_2$ formation efficiency is governed not by atomic diffusion, but rather by the energy barriers associated with chemisorption, desorption, and the association of two hydrogen atoms. These findings establish a robust physical basis for dust-catalyzed H$_2$ formation, offer quantitative reaction rates for refining astrophysical models, and provide a framework for interpreting observations of interstellar molecular materials.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHEMOUT: CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the OUTer Galaxy.

To understand chemical evolution across the Milky Way, deriving molecular abundances in star-forming regions in the outer Galaxy is essential for refining models of sub-Solar metallicity environments. We analyzed IRAM 30 m observations at 3 and 2 mm toward 35 sources at Galactocentric distances of 9$-$24 kpc, within the &quot;CHEMical complexity in star-forming regions of the outer Galaxy&quot; (CHEMOUT) project. We focused on species with the highest detection rates (i.e., HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCO, SO) and searched for trends in column densities, abundances, and line widths with Galactocentric distance. Abundances for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH were updated using H$_2$ column densities from new NIKA2 dust maps. Fractional abundances relative to H$_2$ of most species (HCN, HCO$^+$, c-C$_3$H$_2$, HCO, H$_2$CO, CH$_3$OH) scale at most with the elemental carbon abundance ([C/H]) up to $\sim$24 kpc. SO shows a steeper gradient than sulfur abundance ([S/H]), while H$^{13}$CO$^+$ shows a shallower gradient than [$^{13}$C/H]. Gas turbulence, inferred from line widths, decreases with Galactocentric distance, suggesting a more quiescent environment in the outer Galaxy with respect to the inner Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, the formation efficiency of most molecules, following the parent element availability, is comparable or higher (e.g., for H$^{13}$CO$^+$) than in the local Galaxy, whereas SO forms less efficiently. These results have significant implications for chemical models of the outermost star-forming regions and for understanding molecule formation under lower metallicity conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07407" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The evolution of the bar fraction and bar lengths in the last 12 billion years</a><span class="id">[2510.07407]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the evolution of the bar fraction and length using an extended JWST NIRCam imaging dataset of galaxies at $1 \leq z \leq 4$.

A similar bar fraction is observed for both samples, and combined, we find a declining bar fraction from $0.16^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ to $0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.01}$ over the redshift range. No evolution in the F356W+F444W bar length is measured, with a mean of 3.6 kpc. A slight increase of $\sim 1$ kpc towards $z = 1$ is measured in the F200W sample, with a mean of 2.9 kpc. We find that the correlation between bar length and galaxy mass, for massive galaxies at $z &lt; 1$, is unseen at $z &gt; 1$. By incorporating barred galaxies at $z&lt;1$, we show that there is a modest increase in the bar length ($\approx 2$ kpc) towards $z=0$, but bars longer than $\approx8$ kpc are only found at $z&lt;1$. We show that bars and discs grow in tandem, for the bar length normalised by disc size does not evolve.

One open question is the driving mechanism of galaxy-scale outflows. At low redshift, radio jets often interact with the ISM, generating turbulence and driving ionized outflows. Despite this evidence at low redshift, relatively few studies have investigated the radio-ionized gas connection at cosmic noon. Thus, our main goal is to conduct a pilot study using VLA data for three quasars with moderate/high radio power, which have ionized outflows identified in observations from the SUPER survey. We used [OIII] data from SINFONI analyzed in earlier studies, along with new 6.2 GHz VLA radio observations, at comparable spatial resolution. We also incorporate radio data from the literature to explore the radio emission. We detected extended radio structure in our VLA A-array data for two quasars. The extended structure in J1333+1649 aligns with the smaller-scale emission seen in archival images, suggesting a jet propagating from nuclear to galaxy-wide scales. In all three quasars, we found that the brightest radio emission and ionized gas have comparable spatial scales. Furthermore, the position angles of the radio emission and ionized gas present small offsets for the two targets with extended structures. Given that the kinematics of the ionized gas in all three quasars is dominated by outflows, our results suggest a strong connection between radio emission and ionized outflows in typical AGN at cosmic noon. Based on energetic considerations and comparisons with archival data, radio jets could be a significant mechanism for driving outflows in AGN from cosmic noon to low redshifts. However, with the exception of one object (J1333+1649), we cannot rule out the possibility that the radio emission arises from shocks in the interstellar medium caused by disk winds or radiatively driven outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at $z\sim~1$ and their connection with dark matter halos</a><span class="id">[2511.08685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ, f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$.

We infer that at $z=0.9$ both $f_{\rm M}$ and $f_{\rm j}$ are higher and less mass-dependent than at $z=0$. We speculate that the evolution of $f_{\rm j}$ can be driven by more efficient and centrally concentrated stellar feedback at $z=0.9$, or by an appreciable dry merger history. We also show that assuming the galaxies populating our $z=0.9$ relations evolve into those populating the $z=0$ relations leads to an apparent discrepancy with the hierarchical growth of dark matter halos. To solve this issue, one needs to evoke a progenitor bias scenario, unknown systematics affecting our and previous measurements, or consider the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics is not a reliable dynamical tracer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10640" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flexible Simulation Based Inference for Galaxy Photometric Fitting with Synthesizer</a><span class="id">[2511.10640]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce Synference, a new, flexible Python framework for galaxy SED fitting using simulation-based inference (SBI).

However, accurately grouping and linking a researcher's entire body of work with their individual identity is challenging because of widespread name ambiguity across the growing literature. Algorithmic author name disambiguation provides a scalable approach to disambiguating author identities, yet existing methods have limitations. Many modern author name disambiguation methods rely on comprehensive metadata features such as venue or affiliation. Despite advancements in digitally indexing publications, metadata is often unavailable or inconsistent in large digital libraries(e.g. NASA/ADS). We introduce the Neural Author Name Disambiguator, a method that disambiguates author identities in large digital libraries despite limited metadata availability. We formulate the disambiguation task as a similarity learning problem by employing a Siamese neural network to disambiguate author names across publications relying solely on widely available publication metadata-author names, titles and abstracts. We construct the Large-Scale Physics ORCiD Linked dataset to evaluate the Neural Author Name Disambiguator by cross-matching NASA/ADS publications ORCiD. By leveraging foundation models to embed metadata into features, our model achieves up to 94% accuracy in pairwise disambiguation and over 95% F1 in clustering publications into their researcher identities. We release the testing dataset as a benchmark for physics and astronomy, providing realistic evaluation conditions for future disambiguation methods. The Neural Author Name Disambiguator algorithm demonstrates effective disambiguation with minimal metadata, offering a scalable solution for name ambiguity in large digital libraries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XSNAP: An X-ray Supernova Analysis Pipeline with Application to the Type II Supernova 2024ggi</a><span class="id">[2511.10744]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray observations of Type II supernovae (SNe II) probe the physics of supernova (SN) shocks and the mass-loss histories of their progenitor stars.

We explore how neglecting indirect forces changes (1) the spatial pattern of the surface density perturbation in the disc, (2) the calculation of the torque exerted on the disc by the planet, and (3) the torque on the planet exerted by the disc. For low-mass planets, in the linear regime, the differences in the perturbation pattern are only in its $m=1$ azimuthal harmonic, with an amplitude increasing with the distance from the star. In this regime both the torque on the planet and the deposition torque density in the disc are only weakly affected by non-inclusion of indirect forces, corroborating some results of studies neglecting indirect forces altogether. For higher mass planets, a broader range of azimuthal harmonics of the perturbation are affected. Also, indirect forces have a stronger effect on the planetary torque and on planet migration in the Type II regime. We highlight the importance of including the planetary indirect force in the calculation of the torque on the disc (if disc evolution accounts for indirect force) to ensure conservation of angular momentum carried by the planet-driven density waves. The corresponding indirect torque has an oscillatory, radially-diverging character.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10773" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimization of lenslet arrays for PRIMA Kinetic Inductance Detectors</a><span class="id">[2511.10773]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) is a cryogenically cooled 1.8-m space telescope designed to address fundamental questions about the evolution of galactic ecosystems, the origins of planetary atmospheres, and the buildup of dust and metals over cosmic time. PRIMA will achieve unprecedented sensitivity in the 24 - 261 $\mu$m wavelength range, enabled by background-limited kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs) cooled to 120 mK. For PRIMA's Far-InfraRed Enhanced Survey Spectrometer (FIRESS) instrument, we have developed monolithic kilopixel silicon lenslet arrays to efficiently couple incident radiation from the telescope's fore-optics onto the KID absorber elements. These three-dimensional lenslet arrays are fabricated using grayscale lithography, followed by deep reactive ion etching (DRIE), and are anti-reflection (AR) coated with a quarter-wavelength thick deposition of Parylene-C. The lenslet arrays are aligned and bonded to the KID arrays using a thin layer of epoxy through a flip-chip bonder. In this work, we report on the optimized fabrication, lens design, AR coating, and bonding processes developed for the FIRESS lenslet arrays. We characterize brassboard lenslet arrays fabricated to meet the specifications of the FIRESS low and high spectral bands, demonstrate stepped-thickness AR-coatings to achieve high efficiency across broad wavelength ranges, and present spectral transmission measurements of the AR coating and the epoxy bonding layers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Historical Surveys to Rubin First Look: Absolute Colors of trans-Neptunian objects</a><span class="id">[2511.10782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive photometric study of transNeptunian objects (TNOs) by combining data from SDSS, Col-OSSOS, DES, and the recent Rubin First Look (RFL) data. Our database comprises 43 878 measurements in the u, g, r, i, z, and J filters, from which we derived 8 738 phase curves for 1 921 unique objects. From these data, we computed 12 852 absolute color measurements and spectral slope differences for 1 761 objects, allowing a statistical characterization of phase coloring effects. The colors show no strong bimodality or correlation with orbital parameters, emphasizing the importance of phase correction even for small phase angles. The increase in sample size and application of phase corrections fill previously empty regions in color magnitude space likely affected by observational biases, as redder (and thus darker) objects are preferentially lost near detection limits. Notably, our dataset includes the first photometric measurements from Rubin Observatory during RFL, covering eight objects (five newly discovered TNOs and three previously known). These early LSST observations occupy sparsely sampled regions of parameter space, particularly at faint magnitudes, highlighting the discovery and characterization potential of the full survey. We confirm previous results showing that TNO colors vary with phase angle, exhibiting both reddening and bluening trends. Correlations between (dS'/dalpha) and (alpha) strengthen with increasing (Delta lambda), except for Hi - Hz, which tends to neutralize, consistent with the spectral flattening previously reported in visible wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolutionary Map of the Universe: A pilot survey to detect high Galactic latitude pulsars in variance images with ASKAP</a><span class="id">[2511.10886]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has been proposed that radio pulsars can be distinguished from other point-like radio sources in continuum images by their unique interstellar scintillation signatures. Using data from the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) survey, we conducted a pilot survey of radio pulsars at high Galactic latitude regions via the variance imaging method. Out of approximately 59,800 compact radio sources detected in a  480 square degree survey area, we identified 20 highly variable sources. Among them, 9 are known pulsars, 1 is a known radio star, 1 is an ultra-long period source, 3 are radio star candidates, and the remaining 6 are pulsar candidates. Notably, we discovered two strongly scintillating pulsars: one with a period of 85.707 ms and a dispersion measure (DM) of 19.4 pc/cm^3, and another with a period of 5.492 ms and a DM of 29.5 pc/cm^3. In addition, a third pulsar was discovered in the variance images, with a period of 14.82 ms and a DM of 39.0 pc/cm^3. This source shows a steep radio spectrum and a high degree of circular polarisation. These results underscore the strong potential of variance imaging for pulsar detection in full EMU and future radio continuum surveys planned with Square Kilometre Array (SKA).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPICE – modelling synthetic spectra of stars with non-homogeneous surfaces</a><span class="id">[2511.10998]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the era of large time-domain spectro-photometric surveys, surface variations such as starspots, chemical inhomogeneities, pulsations, rotational distortions, and binary interactions can now be directly detected and modelled. Accurately interpreting these phenomena requires stellar spectral synthesis frameworks that go beyond the assumption of homogeneous surface properties. Yet most existing tools remain limited by this simplification, hindering their applicability to stars with complex surface structures. To address this need, we present SPICE (SPectral Integration Compiled Engine), an open-source Python package for generating high-resolution spectra and photometry from non-homogeneous stellar surface models. SPICE integrates angle-dependent specific intensities from each surface element, enabling forward modelling of both photometric and spectroscopic variability. Case studies demonstrate applications to spotted stars, Cepheid pulsations, and eclipsing binaries, making SPICE well-suited for analysing current and upcoming survey data. In addition, SPICE can directly import meshes from PHOEBE, enabling the modelling of complex binary configurations beyond these case studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surface figure metrology for reflective membrane mirrors based on phase-measuring deflectometry</a><span class="id">[2511.11049]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reflective membrane mirrors provide a lightweight, low-cost alternative to traditional optics for next-generation large-aperture telescopes, but their non-rigid, thin structure poses challenges for surface metrology.

We present in this paper an approach to enable the simulation of SSSB conditions in a drop tower facility on Earth, which is being addressed as part of the AKUS (&quot;Activity of Comets under Partial Gravity&quot;) project. This especially concerns their prevailing gravity levels, which range between 10^-2 g and 10^-4 g. In order to simulate the conditions of SSSB as accurately as possible, an acceleration system based on servo motors and spindle axes has been developed. The accelerations are transferred from the motors to the spindle axes containing a comet-like sample. These are together placed inside a vacuum chamber providing a vacuum quality of 10^-6 mbar. The whole setup is installed inside the Einstein-Elevator. Our results show that, with the current setup, we are able to generate conditions from 10^-2 g down to 10^-3 g. The maximum deviations under these conditions are +/-5x10^-4 g. Additionally, this setup offers the opportunity to conduct different kinds of experiments in which the described gravity levels and vacuum conditions are needed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics in pkdgrav3 for Shock Physics Simulations I: Hydrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2511.11425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present pkdgrav3, a high-performance, fully parallel tree-SPH code designed for large-scale hydrodynamic simulations including self-gravity.

In particular, we focus on the color difference between the optical V band and the WISE 3.4 microns W1 band as a diagnostic. We compared their infrared light curves with their optical counterparts. We identified a strong correlation from which we proposed a color difference model that can be used for further identification and characterization of novae. Our analysis validates the mass-loss timescale theory, which predicts that systems with lower accretion rates accumulate larger envelopes and produce more massive ejecta. We also confirm models' prediction that the early color evolution of novae is governed by ejecta expansion and cooling. From our sample statistics, we infer a Galactic nova rate of approximately 40 to 50 novae per year, consistent with modern and infrared-corrected estimates. The resultant model from this work paves the way for future large-scale investigations of nova candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-situ environmental radiation background measurement in the second phase of CJPL</a><span class="id">[2511.11044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL), the deepest and largest underground laboratory worldwide, provides a low radiation background environment, which is necessary to frontier scientific research, such as the experimental studies of rare-event physics.

Several GNSS satellites pass through the main and sidelobes of the beam each day, enabling efficient mapping of the 2D beam structure. Due to the high SNR and abundance of GNSS satellites, we find evidence that GNSS can probe several sidelobes of the beam through repeatable measurements of the beam over several days. Over three days of measurements, the smallest observed difference in the primary beam's main lobe was 0.56 dB-Hz. We also compare our results in the sidelobes to simulations and find rough agreement in shape. When scaling the observations and simulations to match in the main lobe power levels, we find deviations in at least one of the first few nulls of approximately 5 dB or less. There is saturation in the main lobe for most satellites, which can likely be mitigated by better attenuation before the receiver input. We compare our work to other satellite systems that have been successful and are likely complementary to this technique. However, GNSS offers key advantages, including continuous transmission, broader frequency coverage relevant to CHORD, SKA-mid, and the DSA-2000, as well as more frequent satellite passes, making it a promising calibration method.

This approach enables analytical exploration of atomic-scale transport within the lattice without necessitating parameterization. The quenching factors across the nuclear recoil energy range from 20 eV to 10 keV have been thoroughly investigated. A remarkable agreement with experimental data is achieved, particularly for the minimal energy regime conducted to date, reaching the level of a single electron-hole pair. This work presents evidence of a crucial and fundamental distribution of the quenching factor, which can be associated to the collisional interactions underlying the transport phenomena. The region below 4 keV of the quenching factor, where discrepancies have been observed with the Lindhard's model, is found to be significantly attributed to the lattice binding effect and the specific crystal structure. In contrast, a gradual functional relationship is identified below approximately 100 eV, indicating that the quenching factor is influenced by the crystallographic orientation of the target material. From a distributional perspective, our analysis allows for the determination of the minimum exclusion mass for the dark matter nucleon elastic scattering channel at 0.29 $\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity for the sub-$\mathrm{GeV}/c^2$ mass region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of Concept</a><span class="id">[2506.16810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar spectropolarimetric inversion – inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector – is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We explore attention maps, linking the transformer's learned behaviour to line-formation physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Model Framework for Reconstructing Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curves</a><span class="id">[2506.23681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mitigating data gaps in Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) light curves (LCs) is crucial for cosmological research, enhancing the precision of parameters, assuming perfect satellite conditions for complete LC coverage with no gaps.

The study expands on a previous 521 GRB sample by incorporating seven models: Deep Gaussian Process (DGP), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), Hybrid CNN with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-BiLSTM), Bayesian Neural Network (BNN), Polynomial Curve Fitting, Isotonic Regression, and Quartic Smoothing Spline (QSS). Results indicate that QSS significantly reduces uncertainty across parameters: 43.5% for log Ta, 43.2% for log Fa, and 48.3% for alpha, outperforming the other models where alpha denotes the slope post-plateau based on Willingale 2007 functional form. The Polynomial Curve Fitting model demonstrates moderate uncertainty reduction across parameters, while CNN-BiLSTM has the lowest outlier rate for alpha at 0.77%. These models broaden the application of machine-learning techniques in GRB LC analysis, enhancing uncertainty estimation and parameter recovery, and complement traditional methods like the Attention U-Net and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP).

Extending this analysis to also combine with the DES-Y5 supernova catalogue, our Bayesian analysis reaches a significance of $3.07{\scriptstyle\pm0.10}\,\sigma$ in favour of $w_0w_a$CDM. By performing a comprehensive tension analysis, employing five complementary metrics, we pinpoint the origin: a significant ($\approx 2.95\sigma$), low-dimensional tension between DESI DR2 and DES-Y5 that is present only within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. The $w_0w_a$CDM model is preferred precisely because its additional parameters act to resolve this specific dataset conflict. The convergence of our findings with independent geometric analyses suggests that the preference for dynamic dark energy is primarily driven by the resolution of inter-dataset tensions, warranting a cautious interpretation of its statistical significance.</p></div></details></article></body>
