Consequently, there have been many efforts to probe their existence in astrophysical black hole candidates, spanning ten orders of magnitude in mass. Nevertheless, horizons remain an obstacle to unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, most sharply presented by the information paradox. This has motivated a proliferation of horizonless alternatives (black hole foils) that avoid event horizons and are therefore benign. We show that for typical accreting astronomical targets, largely independent of a foil's underlying microphysics, a horizonless compact surface will generically be ensconced within an optically thick, scattering dominated baryonic settling layer that efficiently reprocesses the kinetic energy of infalling matter into observable thermal emission. The emergent photosphere luminosity is driven toward the accretion-powered equilibrium value and is only weakly sensitive to the foil redshift. These atmospheres are convectively stable and naturally imply that the emitting photosphere forms at modest redshift even when the surface redshift is extreme. Moreover, local gas-surface interaction provides a microphysical lower bound on the effective base temperature, insulating the atmosphere from arbitrarily cold foils. The unknown properties of the foil enter only through local boundary conditions controlling baryon processing and thermal coupling at the surface, making the solutions broadly applicable to horizonless alternatives that do not invoke significant additional nonlocal interactions. Thus, under minimal assumptions (GR exterior and local surface interactions), horizonless foils are generically observationally exposed: the absence of a thermal photosphere directly constrains or rules out broad classes of such models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supermassive black holes swallow stellar objects at high rates: from Little Red Dots to Black Hole Stars</a><span class="id">[2602.15929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supermassive black hole growth plausibly occurs via runaway astrophysical black hole mergers in nuclear star clusters that form intermediate mass black hole seeds at high redshifts. Such a model of Little Red Dots yields an order-of-magnitude higher rate of tidal disruption events than that of black hole captures. Our prediction, normalised to our proposed resolution of SMBH seeding, yields detectable TDE rates at high redshift. The resulting dense gas cocoons generate the nuclei of LRDs, each incorporating a central massive black-hole-star, with comparable masses in gas, stars, and massive black hole within a scale of around a parsec as inferred from the various spectral signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MadEvolve: Evolutionary Optimization of Cosmological Algorithms with Large Language Models</a><span class="id">[2602.15951]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a general framework to discover scientific algorithms and apply it to three problems in computational cosmology. Our code, MadEvolve, is similar to Google's AlphaEvolve, but places a stronger emphasis on free parameters and their optimization. Our code starts with a baseline human algorithm implementation, and then optimizes its performance metrics by making iterative changes to its code. As a further convenient feature, MadEvolve automatically generates a report that compares the input algorithm with the evolved algorithm, describes the algorithmic innovations and lists the free parameters and their function. Our code supports both auto-differentiable, gradient-based parameter optimization and gradient-free optimization methods. We apply MadEvolve to the reconstruction of cosmological initial conditions, 21cm foreground contamination reconstruction and effective baryonic physics in N-body simulations. In all cases, we find substantial improvements over the base algorithm. We make MadEvolve and our three tasks publicly available at this http URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planet-Disk Interactions and the Convective Overstability. I. Low Mass Planets</a><span class="id">[2602.15978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapid inward migration driven by Type I torques threatens the survival of low-mass planets in their nascent protoplanetary disks (PPDs). Positive co-rotation torques offer a potential solution, but require viscous diffusion to remain unsaturated. However, it is unclear if (magneto)-hydrodynamic turbulence provides the necessary diffusion, and disk profiles supporting such torques are often also susceptible to the Convective Overstability (COS) for suitable gas cooling timescales. To this end, we investigate torques on low-mass planets through radially global 2D (razor-thin) and vertically unstratified 3D hydrodynamic simulations of PPDs with thermal diffusion and optically thin cooling. Our 3D models with thermal diffusion, which allows COS development, show systematically different torque behavior compared to 2D models, wherein COS is absent. In 3D, the COS saturates into large-scale, long-lived vortices that migrate radially and interact gravitationally with the embedded planet. When these vortices encounter the planet, they typically provide positive torque &quot;kicks&quot; counteracting inward migration, as the less-massive vortices are scattered onto horseshoe orbits by the more-massive planet. We validate our simulation methods against the theoretical framework of Paardekooper et al. (2011) and demonstrate that COS-induced torque modifications can extend migration timescales by factors of approximately 10. For plausible disk models, our results suggest that COS activity can lengthen migration timescales sufficiently to overlap with, or even exceed Super-Earth formation windows (0.1-5 Myr). In contrast, simulations with optically thin cooling do not show significant torque modifications, as COS saturates in near-axisymmetric structures without producing large-scale vortices for the disk models considered here.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diffusive Instabilities in Dusty Disks: Linear Growth and Nonlinear Breakdown</a><span class="id">[2602.16043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We revisit the diffusive instability in dusty disks that arises when the dust mass diffusivity and/or viscosity decreases sufficiently steeply with increasing dust density. Our updated model includes an incompressible, viscous gas that responds azimuthally and couples to the dust through drag. We show that the basic criterion for diffusion-slope-driven instability remains approximately $\beta_\mathrm{diff}\lesssim -2$ for small dust stopping times, with gas feedback providing only modest quantitative changes for parameters motivated by streaming-instability turbulence. We perform nonlinear numerical calculations and confirm linear growth and mode selection toward the fastest-growing wavenumber. However, for power-law closures $D\propto\Sigma^{\beta_\mathrm{diff}}$ with $\beta_\mathrm{diff}&lt;0$, the nonlinear evolution does not saturate. Instead, steepening gradients amplify the nonlinear dust-pressure term and drive finite-time collapse into increasingly sharp spikes. Motivated by the absence of multidimensional saturation channels in our 1D framework, we test a simple piecewise closure in which the negative diffusion slope operates only over a finite density interval. This modification eliminates blowup and produces peak densities controlled by the imposed saturation scale. Our results support diffusive instabilities as a linear organizing mechanism in dusty turbulence, while highlighting that realistic nonlinear saturation requires additional physics beyond the present closure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Direct contact binary planetesimal formation from gravitational collapse</a><span class="id">[2602.16056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bilobate contact binaries comprise a significant fraction of the relict Kuiper Belt, which includes the exemplary contact binary (486958) Arrokoth. The surfaces of its lobes contain similar amounts of highly volatile chemical species and few craters, indicating formation in a homogeneous and gentle environment. Arrokoth's bilobate shape was initially hypothesized to have formed via the direct gravitational collapse of a pebble cloud in the solar system's protoplanetary disk. However, alternative hypotheses have proposed that Arrokoth may be the result of binary planetesimal formation and the subsequent dynamical evolution of the binary components into contact through external perturbations over long timescales. Here, we show that contact binary planetesimals like Arrokoth can form directly from the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds. We used a soft-sphere discrete element method (SSDEM) to discover that planetesimals form a wide variety of shapes, including bilobate contact binaries. This method creates planetesimals as particle-aggregates with particles resting upon each other's surfaces via mutual surface penetration. The formation of contact binaries in our simulations strengthens the hypothesis that Arrokoth, and perhaps many other contact binaries in the Kuiper Belt, formed directly as bilobate objects from gravitational collapse, and so their shapes and surfaces record the era of planet formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Carousel Lens II: Cosmological Constraints with GIGA-Lens</a><span class="id">[2602.16077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nature of dark matter and dark energy are among the central questions in cosmology. Strong gravitational lenses with multiple source planes provide a geometric probe of cosmology: the ratio of deflection angles at different redshifts depends only on angular-diameter distances, constraining the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the dark energy equation of state $w$. However, constraints from this technique have historically lagged behind those from the CMB, SNe Ia, and BAO. In this work, we present new cosmological constraints from the Carousel Lens, a cluster-scale lens with more than 40 extended images from 11 spectroscopically confirmed sources. Its relaxed core and rich set of extended images behind the main halo make it particularly suitable for cosmological inference. Using the GIGA-Lens pipeline, we construct a pixel-level lens model including six HST-detected sources and four mass components. From this model, we obtain $w$CDM constraints of $\Omega_m = 0.34^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ and $w = -1.31^{+0.35}_{-0.32}$ from the Carousel Lens alone, accounting for both statistical and systematic uncertainties. We further project that including four additional known higher-redshift sources, assuming similar fractional uncertainties, could improve the constraining power by  80%, bringing the precision close to that of the CMB and SNe Ia. For an evolving dark energy model ($w_0w_a$CDM), the Carousel Lens alone yields constraints comparable to the CMB, providing an independent and complementary probe alongside SN Ia and BAO. While currently systematic uncertainties dominate, which we quantify through simulations, our results demonstrate that relaxed multi-source-plane cluster lenses can deliver competitive cosmological constraints. Further improvements are expected from reductions in systematics and from incorporating higher-redshift sources (known and new) with high-resolution imaging.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16107" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Symmetron on growth and RSD multipoles</a><span class="id">[2602.16107]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate the effects of the growth rate scale dependence in the Symmetron modified gravity (MG) model on cosmic structure formation and we analyze the redshift-space distortion (RSD) multipoles, comparing with the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model (specifically the F6) and the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The analysis employs a scale-dependent growth equation and utilizes the fk-PT perturbation theory approach, implemented in the FOLPS-nu code, to compute the full 1-loop power spectrum multipoles, in particular, the monopole and quadrupole ($\ell=0,2$, respectively). The results show that at redshift $z=0$, the monopole of both MG models is suppressed compared to $\Lambda$CDM, with the Symmetron being closer to the standard model, while the quadrupole presents the opposite behavior. To validate the pipeline, we use General Relativity (GR) mock catalogs (EZMocks), since suitable Symmetron simulations are not available. The main result is that the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis successfully recovers the expected GR limit (i.e., $\beta_0 \approx 0$) from the Symmetron model when applied to this mock data, confirming the viability of our methodology for cosmological inference. Then, we conclude that the pipeline is prepared to test MG models against current and near-future galaxy surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Detection of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) Feature in the 3-Point Correlation Function of DESI DR1 Luminous Red Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.16134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first detection of the 3-Point Correlation Function (3PCF) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signal from the DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) sample of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs), which contains over 2.1 million galaxies. Our analysis is based on a tree-level redshift-space bispectrum template, which is then transformed to position space using the Fast Fourier Transform on Logarithmic scales (FFTLog) algorithm. We detect the BAO feature with a significance of approximately $8.1\sigma$ using the EZmock covariance matrix and $8.5\sigma$ using the analytical covariance matrix, for the full LRG redshift range ($0.4&lt;z&lt;1.1$), denoted as the $z_{\rm full}$ sample. We use the Abacus altMTL mocks, the most precise DESI DR1 mock catalogs currently available, to validate our model. We find that our model fits the mocks well, with a small offset of $0.6\%$ in the recovered BAO scale, which we treat as a systematic error due to modeling. We measure the angle-averaged distance, $D_{\rm V}(z = 0.68)/r_{\rm d} = 15.88 \pm 0.27$ ($1.72\%$ precision) when using the covariance matrix estimated from EZmocks and $D_{\rm V}(z = 0.68)/r_{\rm d} = 15.72 \pm 0.18$ ($1.12\%$ precision) when using the analytical Gaussian covariance matrix. Our results show excellent agreement with the DESI DR1 2PCF BAO measurements as well. We also explore several other ways to estimate the error and find between $1.7$–$2.2\%$ precision on the BAO scale from the EZmock covariance matrix and between $1.1$–$1.5\%$ precision from the analytical covariance matrix. This work represents the first detection of the BAO feature in the DESI 3PCF, establishing its ability to probe the expansion history of the Universe with future DESI 3PCF measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Ionospheric TEC Variations in Solar and Geomagnetic Influences Across Solar Activity Phases</a><span class="id">[2602.16139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study examines the variability of ionospheric total electron content (VTEC) in response to solar and geomagnetic drivers across solar cycles 23 to 25. While the dominant effect of solar radiation on VTEC is well-known, a comprehensive understanding of how these relationships and their time-lags vary across distinct solar cycle phases and across cycles of differing intensity has been lacking. Using global VTEC data from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Global Ionospheric Maps (CASG) and solar-geophysical indices from NASA's OMNI dataset spanning from 1998 to 2025, this study bridges that gap by quantifying correlation strengths and time-lag relationships between VTEC and parameters such as $F_{10.7}$ solar flux, R sunspot number, Kp, Ap, and Dst indices, and solar wind properties. Results show that solar proxies, particularly $F_{10.7}$ and R sunspot number, exhibit the strongest, most consistent correlations with VTEC, especially during the ascending and descending phases of the solar cycle, with a characteristic $\sim2$-day lag attributed to thermospheric oxygen dynamics and ionospheric recombination processes. In contrast, geomagnetic indices exhibit weaker and phase-dependent correlations, while direct correlations between solar wind parameters and global VTEC are weak, as their influence is primarily mediated by geomagnetic activity and exhibits strong regional and temporal heterogeneity. Phase-resolved analyses further reveal that geomagnetic activity plays a more prominent role during transitional phases, while maximum and minimum periods are dominated by EUV variability and non-solar drivers, respectively. These findings highlight the necessity of incorporating solar phase and time-lag dependencies in ionospheric modelling and forecasting efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16214" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Ray Spectra and Metal Budget Regulated by the Galactic Wind</a><span class="id">[2602.16214]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the advection effect of the Galactic wind on the local cosmic ray spectra. The spectral hardening from a few hundred GV and softening from a few TV are reproduced by a velocity profile with a maximum velocity of $\sim 700~\mbox{km}~ \mbox{s}^{-1}$ without introducing a break in the power-law dependence of the diffusion coefficient. Additionally, we find that a hard CR spectrum below $\sim$ TV with an index of $\sim 2$ at an altitude $\sim 3$-$5$ kpc from the Galactic disk. This hard spectrum is favorable for the gamma-ray spectrum of the Fermi bubbles. With the obtained CR fluxes, we discuss the matter circulation in our Galaxy with the wind. While the wind has an essential role in maintaining the metal abundance in the disk, the production rate of Beryllium, which originates from CR spallation, is so low that the ratio Be/O in the halo should be larger than that in the disk gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16221" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reinterpreting the sunward electron deficit: Implications for solar wind acceleration and core population formation</a><span class="id">[2602.16221]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper re-evaluates the relationship between the observed sunward electron cutoff energy and the depth of the Sun's global electrostatic potential. It investigates whether taking into account the effects of local traps formed by magnetic fluctuations provides an alternative explanation for the observed electron deficit. The fluctuations of the highly variable interplanetary magnetic field form a series of shallow magnetic mirror traps that move at approximately the speed of the solar wind. The study investigates the dynamics of electrons as they move outward against an attractive solar electrostatic potential and interact with these traps. By following the motion of the electrons using first-principles calculations, we assess the effect of the traps on the velocity distribution of the particles. Electrons that escape the local trap continue to lose energy as they move outward until they are eventually captured by subsequent traps, preventing them from returning to the observer as sunward-moving particles. We derive a mathematical expression for the cutoff velocity, defined as the limit beyond which particles can no longer overtake the outer endpoint of a local trap. It turns out that the observed cutoff energy characterizes only the local potential drop within a trap, rather than the total depth of the Sun's potential well. The true potential well can be significantly deeper, scaled by the ratio of the radial distance from the Sun to the trap size. Furthermore, electrons captured by these moving traps contribute to the formation of the solar wind core population. The Sun's electrostatic potential is a more significant factor in solar wind acceleration than previously interpreted from cutoff data. The interaction between electrostatic deceleration and moving magnetic traps provides a new framework for understanding the origin and behavior of the solar wind core electrons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Enigmatic Type Icn Supernova 2024abvb Located  22 kpc from Its Host Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2602.16227]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report multiwavelength observations of the highly offset ( 22.4 kpc) SN 2024abvb, the sixth Type Icn supernova to date. With a peak magnitude of Mr = -19.55 +/- 0.11 mag, it is among the most luminous in the existing sample and shows similar colours and decline rates to other SNe Icn. The early optical spectra show a blue continuum with narrow C II features (vFWHM   2000 km s^-1), consistent with a typical wind velocity of a Wolf-Rayet star. The absence of C III lambda 5696 emission at the time of explosion is consistent with a Type Ibn supernova; however, the lack of narrow He lines in both the optical and near-infrared spectra supports a SNe Icn classification. Unlike the majority of SNe Icn, we do not detect broad features in the late-time (7-21 days relative to o-band peak) spectral phase of SN 2024abvb. Semi-analytical modelling of the light curves shows that it can be reproduced by  2.6 Msun of SN ejecta interacting with  0.3 Msun of circumstellar material (CSM), both larger than other SNe Icn but consistent with rapidly evolving SNe Ibn. The metallicity at the SN location is significantly lower than the global metallicity of its host galaxy, suggesting that line-driven mass loss required to strip the progenitor of its H and He envelopes was likely inefficient. We estimate the star-formation-rate history at the location of SN 2024abvb and find that it lies at the bottom  5th percentile among SESNe hosts, inconsistent with a Wolf-Rayet progenitor. Based on its spectral features, local and host environment properties, and host-galaxy offset, we favour an 8-10 Msun star stripped by a compact companion as the progenitor, with a sufficient runaway velocity to reach the observed offset.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Propagation Characteristics of the April 21, 2023 CME</a><span class="id">[2602.16239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate estimation of propagation characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is crucial for predicting their geoeffectiveness. Stereoscopic techniques to study the kinematics of CMEs generally have been carried out using remote sensing observations from three viewpoints, i.e. STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and SOHO. Since the loss of STEREO-B in 2014, stereoscopic reconstruction of CMEs has been restricted to the observations from only two viewpoints, i.e., STEREO-A and SOHO. When the angle of separation between STEREO-A and SOHO is small, it leads to larger uncertainties in the CME kinematics derived using stereoscopic techniques. In this paper, we demonstrate how this limitation can be addressed and how uncertainties in the estimation of CME kinematics and propagation direction can be reduced. For this purpose, we selected the CME of April 21, 2023, which was observed by two spacecraft, i.e. STEREO-A and SOHO, separated by a small 10 degree angle. Using the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) model on the remote-sensing observations near the Sun and the Advanced Drag-Based Model (ADBM) in the heliosphere, we estimated the arrival time of the CME at different locations in the heliosphere and compared it with the actual arrival time obtained from the in-situ measurements taken by three spacecraft, BepiColombo, STEREO-A and Wind. Our analysis reveals a directional uncertainty of approx 20 degree from observations from two viewpoints. These uncertainties significantly affect the arrival-time prediction of the CME. We consider the actual chronology of CME arrival times at STEREO-A and Wind as critical parameters to constrain the direction of propagation, which serves as a key input in the ADBM. The chronology of arrival of the CME ejecta at STEREO-A, which is 4.5 hrs earlier than at Wind, proved essential for resolving directional ambiguities in the GCS reconstruction model</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16359" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical analysis of Lyapunov Times for Trans-Neptunian Objects and Main-Belt Asteroids: stability, accuracy, and methodological comparisons</a><span class="id">[2602.16359]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We computed Lyapunov times ($T_L$) for a sample of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) and outer main-belt asteroids (MBAs) using three numerical approaches: the variational method and two implementations of the renormalization technique. For each object, $T_L$ was derived both from the nominal orbit and from ensembles of 1001 orbital clones, enabling direct comparison between single-orbit and ensemble-based estimates. Across the sample, the methods generally produced consistent results, though larger discrepancies were observed for some MBAs. TNOs, in contrast, displayed greater consistency across methods, likely due to fewer overlapping resonances. Importantly, clone ensembles provided more robust and reliable stability indicators than nominal-orbit computations. Median values from clone populations reduced method-dependent biases and revealed dynamical behaviors that would remain hidden in single-orbit analyses, especially for objects with poorly constrained orbits or evolving in resonant regions. While our study focused on a limited but diverse set of objects, the methodology can be directly extended to larger populations, offering a systematic framework for exploring the long-term stability and dynamical evolution of main-belt asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects or other classes of objects in the Solar System.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16364" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High significance detection at 4.8 GHz of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster with the Sardinia Radio Telescope</a><span class="id">[2602.16364]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of observations of the radio halo in the Coma galaxy cluster at 4.8 GHz performed with the Sardinia Radio Telescope. The radio halo in this cluster is detected for the first time at this frequency with a statistical significance higher than $3\sigma$. After the removal of the Radio Frequency Interference and of the discrete sources contribution, and after the correction for the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, we estimate a flux density of $61\pm11$ mJy, higher than the value previously reported in literature at this frequency. By using the value we obtained, it is possible to estimate an integrated spectral index between 4.8 and 6.6 GHz of $\alpha\sim1.17$, where $F(\nu)\propto \nu^{-\alpha}$, indicating a possible higher-frequency slowdown of the spectral steepening observed between 1.4 and 4.8 GHz. Such a spectral behavior is compatible with turbulent re-acceleration if the seed electrons have a spectrum extending up to high energies, as in the case of continuous injection by hadronic interactions or dark matter annihilation. We also report the detection at 4.8 GHz of a polarized spot inside the halo, without an evident counterpart, already detected at 6.6 GHz.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion Disk Magnetic Braking</a><span class="id">[2602.16395]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A protostellar disk is threaded by a static magnetic field that is perpendicular to the disk-surface.

From a comparison with a large number of Geminids observed by the European Fireball Network and all brightest Geminids from the Prairie Fireball Network in USA and the Canadian MORP Network, we have shown that for Geminids with an entry mass greater than approximately 10 grams, the terminal altitude limit does not decrease further as it does for smaller Geminids, but remains constant at around 38 km. In this comparison, we have shown that there is only one exception, and that is the Geminid presented here. This one penetrated nearly 6 km deeper with very low terminal speed for Geminids. During the atmospheric flight this Geminid meteoroid slowed down from its original speed of 35.75 km/s to 6.8 km/s. This small meteoroid with initial mass of only 0.25 kg is probably the fastest candidate for a meteorite dropping event ever observed. This solid meteoroid belonging to the meteor shower survived a significant dynamic pressure of almost 2 MPa and thus ranks among the interplanetary bodies of asteroidal origin that caused the observed meteorite fall. Although a similar Geminid event has been previously presented in the literature, we demonstrate here that this claim was flawed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A fast radio burst cyclone in technicolour: evidence of plasma lensing</a><span class="id">[2602.16409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are bright, energetic, radio pulses of extragalactic origin. A dichotomy has emerged in the population: some produce repeat bursts, while the majority do not. Most repeating sources only show rare repetitions, and none have been studied extensively over the wide bandwidths necessary to disentangle the physical processes that produce emission from distortions to bursts caused by intervening ionised gas. Here we present radio observations of the most active repeating source, FRB 20240114A. Using an ultrawideband receiving system, we have detected 5526 repetitions, revealing an extreme spectral and temporal variability in the burst emission. The bursts exhibit longer-term broadband variations in central emission frequency over multiple months, and narrowband bursts that have correlations in central frequencies on time scales of milliseconds to minutes. The spectral and temporal properties are consistent with the source undergoing magnification by foreground plasma lenses, potentially embedded in a turbulent circumsource medium. This extreme example highlights the role of plasma lenses in the observed properties of burst emission and can explain the diversity in activity and energetics of the entire FRB population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation. Impact of galaxy intrinsic alignment modelling choices on Euclid 3x2pt cosmology</a><span class="id">[2602.16448]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Euclid galaxy survey will provide unprecedented constraints on cosmology, but achieving unbiased results will require an optimal characterisation and mitigation of systematic effects. Among these, the intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies are one of the dominant contaminants of the weak lensing (WL) and galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) probes. In this work, we assess IA modelling choices for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses by comparing the performance of the two most commonly used IA models, nonlinear alignment (NLA) and tidal alignment tidal torquing (TATT), along with several variations. Our analyses combine three perspectives: i) the constraining power on the IA and cosmological parameters for each IA model, ii) the bias that results when the IA analysis model differs from the model used to generate the synthetic data vector, and iii) the degeneracies between IA and photometric redshift (photo-z) nuisance parameters. Among the IA models analysed, the redshift-dependent TATT model (zTATT) provides the most flexible description of IA, with a similar constraining power compared to simpler IA models, making it a well-motivated choice for Euclid DR1 3x2pt analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16453" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Benchmarking Photolysis Rates with Socrates (24.11): Species for Earth and Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2602.16453]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the Socrates photolysis scheme, we present newly calculated photolysis rates under modern Earth atmospheric conditions for species directly relevant to Earth and species relevant to different atmospheric compositions.

We provide a new set of benchmark photolysis rates for additional species both for Solar irradiance and when irradiated by an M dwarf host star. In general, the higher actinic flux at far-UV and shorter wavelengths of the M dwarf compared to the Sun drives increased photolysis rates for reactions with high threshold energies.

Therefore, the ability to accurately determine properties of the magnetic field requires a thorough understanding of the dust alignment mechanism. We investigate the influence of anisotropic radiation fields on the alignment of dust particles by magnetic fields, known as radiative torque (RAT) alignment. Specifically, we take advantage of the unique spatial configuration of the molecular cloud core L43, which contains an embedded yet optically visible star acting as a local source of anisotropic illumination. Based on polarization maps obtained at wavelengths of $154 \mu\mathrm{m}$ (SOFIA/HAWC+), as well as $450 \mu\mathrm{m}$ and $850 \mu\mathrm{m}$ (JCMT/SCUBA-2), which show variations in the degree and angle of polarized emission across all wavelengths, we applied the differential measure analysis method to infer magnetic field strengths and analyze the global polarization spectrum of this source. We derived plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths ranging from approximately 13 to 60 $\mu\mathrm{G}$, varying with wavelength, and find a negative slope of the polarization spectrum. Compared to 3D radiative transfer simulations, this finding can be attributed, at least partially, to variations in dust properties and temperatures along the line of sight. However, the additional influence of variations in the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight cannot be ruled out. Our results favor radiative torques as the primary alignment mechanism, as they indicate that the degree of polarization is dependent on temperature and hence the strength of the local radiation field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New self-consistent theoretical descriptions for mass-loss rates of O-type stars</a><span class="id">[2602.16526]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive O-type stars lose a significant fraction of their mass through radiation-driven winds, a process that critically shapes their evolution and feedback into the interstellar medium. Accurate predictions of mass-loss rates are essential for models of stellar structure and population synthesis. We computed wind parameters for O-type stars using a self-consistent approach that couples the hydrodynamics of the wind with detailed calculations of the line acceleration. This approach follows the theory of radiation-driven stellar winds and allows us to derive mass-loss rate distributions for different atomic configurations of the stellar flux. We used the TLUSTY code for stellar atmosphere models to compute non-local thermodynamic equilibrium models; these models served as input radiation fields for the calculation of the line-force parameters, for which we used the LOCUS code. These line-force parameters were then iteratively coupled with the HYDWIND code to solve the wind hydrodynamics. The procedure was applied across a grid of stellar parameters for three chemical configurations. We obtain self-consistent wind parameters for a broad set of O-type stellar models. The results show a systematic decrease in mass-loss rates with the inclusion of more elements in the radiation field, which is attributed to a strong effect on the UV region of the spectral energy distribution. As more elements are included, resulting in a larger number of spectral lines, the contribution from the UV diminishes, leading to lower mass-loss rates. We fitted three theoretical prescriptions for $\dot{M}$ using a Bayesian approach; this yielded Pearson correlation values greater than 0.92 for all three model grids. It also allowed for the estimation of the wind momentum-luminosity relationships for each of the grids, yielding results similar to those based on observations of O-type stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16559" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOTO identification and broadband modelling of the counterpart to the SVOM GRB 250818B</a><span class="id">[2602.16559]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapid localisation and follow-up of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) increasingly rely on low-latency triggers from new missions coupled to wide-field robotic optical facilities.

We compile and homogenise X-ray, optical/NIR, and radio data to build broadband light curves and spectral energy distributions. The afterglow is unusually luminous for a nominal short GRB, lying on the bright end of the short-GRB population in X-rays and optical and among the most luminous high-redshift short-GRB afterglows in the radio. MeerKAT detects the source at 3.1 GHz, while ALMA provides deep higher-frequency limits. Keck/LRIS spectroscopy shows continuum and metal absorption (Fe II, Mg II, Mg I), giving $z=1.216$. Synchrotron forward-shock modelling favours a constant-density medium and strongly prefers refreshed (energy-injection) emission, well described by a two-component jet with $E_{K,iso} \sim 4\times10^{52}$ erg, $n_0 \sim 3.6$ cm$^{-3}$, $\theta_j \simeq 0.10$ rad ($\sim 5.7$ deg), and $p \simeq 1.64$.

However, constructing models able to generate cosmological magnetic fields while avoiding strong coupling, backreaction, and cosmic microwave background constraints remains challenging. We study a novel mechanism in which brief non–slow-roll phases during inflation amplify primordial magnetic fields at small scales, while maintaining theoretical consistency and observational viability. We incorporate parity-violating interactions in the vector sector and demonstrate, for the first time in a non–slow-roll framework, that chirality can significantly boost magnetic-field amplitudes and imprint distinctive polarization-dependent spectral features. We complement detailed numerical computations with an analytical treatment yielding compact expressions for chiral vector mode functions that reproduce the main spectral properties. We then develop a systematic formalism to evaluate the stochastic gravitational-wave background naturally induced at second order by these amplified fields, identifying both an intensity component and a circularly polarized contribution with characteristic frequency profiles. We discuss detection prospects with future multiband gravitational-wave observatories, showing that chiral signatures could provide a distinctive observational probe.

The distribution of observed magnitudes preserves this behavior, but is truncated by the detection threshold. If both the population index and detection threshold can be determined, observed meteor rates can be converted to fluxes and extrapolated to any desired brightness or size. We argue that the distribution of observed or instrumental meteor magnitudes is best modeled as an exponentially modified Gaussian (exGaussian) distribution. This is for three reasons: first, an exGaussian distribution is the natural result of random variations in detection threshold and/or post-detection measurement errors in magnitude. Second, an exGaussian distribution provides a better fit to the magnitude distribution than all other competing distributions in the literature; we demonstrate this using both a set of faint optical meteor magnitudes and a set of radar meteor echo amplitudes. Finally, the population index, mean detection threshold, and random variation/error terms are easily extracted from the best-fit parameters of an exGaussian distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16646" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two warm sub-Saturn mass planets identified from the TESS Full Frame Images</a><span class="id">[2602.16646]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Characterization of warm giants is crucial to constrain giant planet formation and evolution.

Aims. We present the discovery of two transiting warm giant planets orbiting solar-type stars from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which were characterized by further spectroscopic and photometric ground-based observations. Methods. We performed a joint analysis of photometric data with radial velocities to confirm and characterize TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b, two sub-Saturns orbiting solar-like stars. Results. TOI-883 b and TOI-899 b have masses of $0.123 \pm 0.012$ $M_J$ and $0.213 \pm 0.024$ $M_J$, radius of $0.604 \pm 0.028$ $R_J$ and $0.991 \pm 0.044$ $R_J$, periods of $10.06$ d and $12.85$ d and equilibrium temperature of $1086 \pm 19$ K and $1040 \pm 19$ K, respectively. Conclusions. While having similar masses, orbital periods and stellar host properties, these planets seem to have different internal compositions, which could point to distinct formation histories.

The topology of ionized regions allows us to infer the nature and properties of ionizing sources, i.e., early galaxies and AGNs. Traditional Fourier statistics, such as the power spectrum, help us quantify the strength of fluctuations in this field at different length scales but do not preserve its phase information. Analyzing the 21-cm brightness temperature field in the image domain retains its non-Gaussian characteristics and morphological information. One such approach is to track the coalescence of multiple ionized regions to form one contiguous ionized region spanning the universe. This is referred to as percolation, and its onset is quantified by a sharp rise in the value of the Largest Cluster Statistic (LCS) approaching unity. In this work, we carry out a percolation analysis of 21-cm brightness temperature fields by studying the redshift evolution of the LCS along a lightcone to distinguish between several simulated reionization scenarios. We have extended previous results on reionization model comparison from the analysis of coeval 21-cm maps to understand how the lightcone effect biases the observed percolation behavior and affects the distinguishability of the source models. We estimate the LCS of subvolumes of different sizes in the 21-cm lightcone maps and study their redshift evolution for different reionization scenarios using a moving volume approach. We find that the percolation transition inferred from a lightcone approaches that from the coeval box as we increase the bandwidth of the moving volume in all but one reionization scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Nonlinear Quenching Effects on Polar Field Buildup in the Sun Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2602.16656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation, embedding physical constraints directly into the neural network framework. By systematically varying transport parameters, we isolate the relative contributions of TQ and LQ to polar dipole buildup. We use the residual dipole moment as a diagnostic for cycle-to-cycle amplification and show that TQ suppression strengthens with increasing diffusivity, while LQ dominates in advection-dominated regimes. The ratio $\Delta D_{\mathrm{LQ}}/\Delta D_{\mathrm{TQ}}$ exhibits a smooth inverse-square dependence on the dynamo effectivity range, refining previous empirical fits with improved accuracy and reduced scatter. The results further reveal that the need for a decay term is not essential for PINN set-up due to the training process. Compared with the traditional 1D SFT model, the PINN framework achieves significantly lower error metrics and more robust recovery of nonlinear trends. Our results suggest that the nonlinear interplay between LQ and TQ can naturally produce alternations between weak and strong cycles, providing a physical explanation for the observed even-odd cycle modulation. These findings demonstrate the potential of PINN as an accurate, efficient, and physically consistent tool for solar cycle prediction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated Constraints on Infrared Cutoff Models and Implications for Large-Scale CMB Anomalies</a><span class="id">[2602.16659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum provides the standard initial conditions for cosmological perturbations. However, the largest scales remain only weakly constrained by CMB observations, leaving room for deviations such as an infrared (IR) cut-off. This possibility is further motivated by the persistence of large-scale CMB anomalies, most notably the low quadrupole power. In this work, we revisit several broad classes of phenomenologically motivated IR cut-off scenarios using parametrised functional forms of the primordial power spectrum. We confront these models with the latest CMB, BAO, and supernova data and derive updated constraints on the cut-off scale and associated features. Our results remain consistent with earlier studies, showing that although such models suppress power at low multipoles, the improvement in fit is marginal and does not overcome the associated parameter penalties. We therefore find no statistically significant evidence favouring IR cut-off models over the standard power-law spectrum with current data. We further explore the interplay between IR cut-off features and a possible increase in the reionisation optical depth, motivated by the recent CMB-BAO tension highlighted by DESI DR2 within the $\Lambda$CDM framework. We show that the additional freedom introduced by large-scale suppression is generally insufficient to support a substantial increase in optical depth, owing to the weak statistical preference for suppressed large-scale temperature power. Finally, we examine the implications of IR cut-off models for large-scale CMB anomalies by analysing the corresponding anomaly statistics within a Bayesian framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital Motions of Binaries in Orion South</a><span class="id">[2602.16676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-angular resolution ($\simeq 0\rlap.{''}06$) VLA and ALMA observations of Orion South separated by 15.52 years.

Such observations allow quantitative tests of the Kerr paradigm and of possible deviations from the no-hair theorem. In scalar-tensor extensions of gravity, black holes may possess primary scalar hair, introducing an additional independent parameter beyond mass and spin. In this work, we construct rotating black hole solutions with primary scalar hair in beyond Horndeski gravity and analyze their photon regions and shadow formation. We show that the scalar hair parameter $Q$ induces characteristic modifications of the shadow, and in particular negative $Q$ enlarges the shadow and reduces its oblateness, while positive $Q$ shrinks and enhances its distortion. Modeling M87* within this framework and imposing the EHT bounds on $\theta_d$ and $\Delta C$, we determine the viable $(a,Q)$ parameter space. We find that current observations do not exclude rotating black holes with primary scalar hair, although the allowed region is significantly restricted for $Q&gt;0$.

Unraveling the Nature of Initial Conditions in the Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2307.11043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The non-thermal nature of the cosmological gravitational wave background (CGWB) makes it difficult to define the initial condition for the graviton distribution, which determines the initial contribution to the CGWB anisotropies. Specifically, unlike Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) photons, primordial gravitational waves (GWs) are not necessarily subject to adiabatic initial conditions. For the CGWB generated by quantum fluctuations of the metric during inflation the initial conditions are not adiabatic. The violation of adiabaticity arises from the presence of independent tensor perturbations during inflation, which behave as two extra fields that affect the standard single-clock argument. The non-adiabatic initial contribution enhances the total CGWB angular power spectrum compared to the standard adiabatic case. Given the high degree of correlation between the CGWB and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies, we present the constrained realization maps of the CGWB built using the high-resolution CMB Planck maps for different initial conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey: Galaxy Sample for the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation Measurement from the Final Dataset</a><span class="id">[2402.10697]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we present and validate the galaxy sample used for the analysis of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) signal in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y6 data. The definition is based on a color and redshift-dependent magnitude cut optimized to select galaxies at redshifts higher than 0.6, while ensuring a high-quality photo-$z$ determination. The optimization is performed using a Fisher forecast algorithm, finding the optimal $i$-magnitude cut to be given by $i$&lt;19.64+2.894$z_{\rm ph}$. For the optimal sample, we forecast an increase in precision in the BAO measurement of $\sim$25% with respect to the Y3 analysis. Our BAO sample has a total of 15,937,556 galaxies in the redshift range 0.6&lt;$z_{\rm ph}$&lt;1.2, and its angular mask covers 4,273.42 deg${}^2$ to a depth of $i$=22.5. We validate its redshift distributions with three different methods: directional neighborhood fitting algorithm (DNF), which is our primary photo-$z$ estimation; direct calibration with spectroscopic redshifts from VIPERS; and clustering redshift using SDSS galaxies. The fiducial redshift distribution is a combination of these three techniques performed by modifying the mean and width of the DNF distributions to match those of VIPERS and clustering redshift. In this paper we also describe the methodology used to mitigate the effect of observational systematics, which is analogous to the one used in the Y3 analysis. This paper is one of the two dedicated to the analysis of the BAO signal in DES Y6. In its companion paper, we present the angular diameter distance constraints obtained through the fitting to the BAO scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AbacusPNG: A modest set of simulations of local-type primordial non-Gaussianity in the DESI era</a><span class="id">[2402.10881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A measurement of a primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) signal through late- or early-Universe probes has the potential to transform our understanding of the physics of the primordial Universe. $N$-body simulations, such as the public \textsc{AbacusPNG} set presented in this study, consisting of 9 boxes, each of size $L_{\rm box} = 2~{\rm Gpc}/h$ and particle mass of $1.01 \times 10^{10} \ M_\odot/h$, provide a viable path forward. As validation, we find good agreement between the simulations and our expectations from one-loop perturbation theory and the `separate universe' method for the matter bispectrum, matter power spectrum and the halo bias parameter associated with PNG, $b_\phi$. As a science application, we investigate the link between halo assembly bias and $b_\phi$ for halo properties known to play a vital role in accurately predicting galaxy clustering: concentration, shear (environment), and accretion rate. We find a strong response for all three parameters, suggesting that the connection between $b_\phi$ and the assembly history of halos needs to be taken into account by future PNG analyses. We further perform the first study of the $b_\phi$ parameter from fits to early DESI data of the luminous red galaxy (LRG) and quasi-stellar object (QSO) samples and comment on the effect on $f_{\rm NL}$ constraints for the allowed galaxy-halo models (note that $\sigma [f_{\rm NL}] \propto \frac{\sigma [b_\phi]}{b_\phi}$). We find that the error on $f_{\rm NL}$ is 21, 6, 22 for the LRGs at $z = 0.5$ and $z = 0.8$ and QSOs at $z = 1.4$, respectively, suggesting that a thorough understanding of galaxy assembly bias is warranted so as to perform robust high-precision analysis of local-type PNG with future surveys.

Yet, simulations indicate that hydrodynamic escape of secondary atmospheres, composed of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, requires intense fluxes of ionizing radiation (XUV) to overcome the effects of high molecular weight and efficient line cooling. This transonic outflow of hot, ionized metals (not hydrogen) presents a novel astrophysical regime ripe for exploration. We introduce an analytic framework to determine which planets retain or lose their atmospheres, positioning them on either side of the cosmic shoreline. We model the radial structure of escaping atmospheres as polytropic expansions - power-law relationships between density and temperature driven by local XUV heating. Our approach diagnoses line cooling with a three-level atom model and incorporates how ion-electron interactions reduce mean molecular weight. Crucially, hydrodynamic escape onsets for a threshold XUV flux dependent upon the atmosphere's gravitational binding. Ensuing escape rates either scale linearly with XUV flux when weakly ionized (energy-limited) or are controlled by a collisional-radiative thermostat when strongly ionized. Thus, airlessness is determined by whether the XUV flux surpasses the critical threshold during the star's active periods, accounting for expendable primordial hydrogen and revival by volcanism. We explore atmospheric escape from Young-Sun Mars and Earth, LHS 1140 b and c, and TRAPPIST-1 b. Our modeling characterizes the bottleneck of atmospheric loss on the occurrence of observable Earth-like habitats and offers analytic tools for future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of Foreground Galaxies on the Estimation of the Hubble Constant from Type Ia Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2502.01602]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae are the established `standard candle' in the construction of the Hubble diagram out to high luminosity distances. Since the Hubble constant that best fits observations of these supernovae often turns out to be high compared to fits to other data, they are currently being investigated for possible systematic effects, with many studies focusing on the calibration of the distance ladder in the local Universe. Here we present a simulation-based assessment of another type of systematic effect, related to the chance that the line of sight to a distant supernova passes close to a foreground galaxy. We consider two cases separately: First, the foreground galaxy may block the line of sight so that the supernova is not observed. Since foreground galaxies are correlated with overdensities that typically magnify the flux of background sources, this effect leads to a systematic removal of lensed supernovae from the sample, biasing the high-redshift Hubble diagram towards demagnified (fainter) supernovae. Second, if the supernova can be observed, its proximity to the foreground galaxy can lead to an incorrect host assignment, especially if the true host has a low surface brightness. Since foreground galaxies are typically found at lower redshifts, this effect introduces another systematic bias. The probability of line-of-sight alignments with foreground galaxies increases with redshift and therefore affects distant supernovae more strongly. We find that both effects are small, but the effect of host misidentification should be included in the systematic error budget at current levels of measurement precision.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray emission in IllustrisTNG circum-cluster environments.

The physical origin of this emitting medium above hot ICM has not yet been determined, especially whether it be thermal or non-thermal. We aim to investigate which gas phase and gas structure more accurately reproduce the soft excess radiation from the cluster core to the outskirts, using simulations. By using the simulation TNG300, we predict the radial profile of thermodynamic properties and the Soft-X-ray surface brightness of 138 clusters within 5 $R_{200}$. Their X-ray emission is simulated for the hot ICM gas phase, the entire Warm-Hot medium, the diffuse and low-density Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). Inside clusters, the soft excess appears to be produced by substructures of the WARM gas phase which host dense warm clumps (i.e, the Warm Circum-Galactic Medium, WCGM), and in fact the inner soft excess is strongly correlated with substructure and WCGM mass fractions. Outside of the virial radius, the fraction of WHIM gas that is mostly inside filaments connected to clusters boosts the soft X-ray excess. The more diffuse the gas is, the higher the soft X-ray excess beyond the virial region. The thermal emission of WARM gas phase, in the form of WCGM clumps and WHIM diffuse filaments, reproduces well the soft excess emission that was observed up to the virial radius in Coma and in the inner regions of other massive clusters. Moreover, our analysis suggests that soft X-ray excess is a proxy of cluster dynamical state, with larger excess being observed in the most unrelaxed clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary Fossils Beyond Perturbation Theory</a><span class="id">[2507.17593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation.

In this analysis, The sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, is treated as a free parameter. By combining uncalibrated comoving distances from BAO and supernovae with constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ from CMB and galaxy lensing/clustering, we break the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy and obtain $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 1.7$ km/s/Mpc when the sum of the neutrino masses is fixed at $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.06$ eV. With an informative prior on the amplitude of primordial fluctuations, $A_s$, we find $H_0 = 70.03 \pm 0.97$ km/s/Mpc. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$ to vary, we find that the neutrino mass is weakly constrained and strongly prior-dependent. Consequently, the inferred $H_0$ is sensitive to the choice of the $\Sigma m_\nu$ prior, with a uniform prior biasing results toward larger neutrino masses and higher $H_0$, while a logarithmic prior reduces this bias significantly. Forecasts for the completed DESI BAO program, combined with Simons-Observatory-like CMB lensing, next-generation $3\times2$-pt data, and expanded supernova samples predict $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 0.67$ km/s/Mpc with fixed $\Sigma m_\nu$, and $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 1.1$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.133$ ($&lt;0.263$) eV at 68% (95%) CL when $\Sigma m_\nu$ is varied.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Explicit M1 Radiation-hydrodynamics Scheme for 3D Protostellar Evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.13949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) scheme that enables 3D simulations resolving both protostellar interiors and their surrounding accretion flows within a single framework, to clarify how a protostar evolves while interacting with the accretion flow. The method builds on an explicit two-moment M1 closure scheme with a reduced speed of light approximation (RSLA) for massively parallel computation. Our scheme introduces a complementary non-RSLA radiation component that dominates in optically thick regions. This hybrid treatment restores physical energy conservation inside protostars, which would otherwise be violated under the RSLA, while retaining the advantage of large time steps. To overcome the limitation of the conventional M1 closure in solving radiative transfer in extremely optically thick regions inside protostars and across steep optical-depth gradients near their surfaces, we incorporate the optical-depth information of neighboring cells into the radiative transfer calculation. We further evolve photon-number densities in addition to radiation energy densities to reconstruct an effective local spectrum on the fly without resorting to costly multi-frequency transport. We implement this scheme in the adaptive mesh refinement code SFUMATO and verify its validity through a series of test calculations. As an application, we follow the early evolution of a massive protostar formed at high redshift, within a full cosmological context. The results reveal a continuous structure connecting the swollen protostar and its surrounding disk, which cannot be captured in conventional 1D models. This RHD scheme opens a path to studies of protostellar evolution and its interaction with the accretion flow in realistic 3D environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation-dominated polar emitting region of an accreting X-ray pulsar – I.

The radiative transfer within the emitting region and the structure of the latter are calculated with the use of the self-consistent algorithm developed earlier. The magnetic scattering cross sections dependent on the photon energy and polarization have been incorporated. Second-order bulk Comptonization over entire emitting region, induced Compton scattering, the switching of the polarization modes, free-free processes, the cyclotron emission because of electron-proton collisions, and a realistic shape of the accretion channel have been taken into account. The case of a dipole magnetic field is considered. It is shown that the induced Compton effect can play a notable role in establishing the electron temperature in the post-shock zone. Within the model shock wave, a higher electron temperature is achieved than in the post-shock zone by means of the bulk-heating mechanism. The photons gaining the energy in the shock wave and above it due to bulk motion effects and the thermal Doppler effect are responsible for the formation of high-energy regions in the emergent continuum of the polarization modes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: Simulation-based $w$CDM inference from weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps with deep learning: Analysis design</a><span class="id">[2511.04681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Data-driven approaches using deep learning are emerging as powerful techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI) pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level. Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs. Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m - S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination.

We refine the hybrid model strategy, which was described in the earlier paper of this series, to model the emergence of the active region during 4 solar days starting shortly before 2011 February 11 and the eruption of an X2.2 flare on February 15. After 4 days of evolution, a major eruption of a magnetic flux rope occurs in the simulation at approximately 3 hours (3\% difference) before the real flare. The eruption leads to magnetic reconnection that contributes to bulk heating in the chromosphere and corona. The deposition of flare energy in the chromosphere causes strong condensations and evaporations, which fill hot post-flare loops and bright flare ribbons that exhibit separation and extension similar to the observed ribbon evolution. The synthesized soft X-ray flux corresponds to X class, which is close to the real event. The upward eruption of the flux rope leads to a piston-driven shock and horizontal expansion that exerts a strong downward impact on the lower atmosphere and generate an apparently fast-propagating chromospheric Moreton wave. We conclude that the data-driven radiative simulation of this active region can reproduce the key observational results of the real flare and demonstrate the great potential of this method for studying solar eruptions in a realistic corona environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Universal CMB $B$-Mode Spectrum from Early Causal Tensor Sources</a><span class="id">[2601.20967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many early universe scenarios predict post-inflationary tensor perturbations from causality-limited, sub-horizon sources. While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06092" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Cosmological Tensions with Hubble Parameter Tomography via Linear Cosmography</a><span class="id">[2602.06092]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Given the persistence of various tensions in the &quot;Cosmic Concordance&quot; – such as the &quot;Hubble Tension&quot;, and possible departures from LambdaCDM time evolution – seen from combinations of complementary data sets (e.g., Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae), it remains an ongoing possibility for these to have a real cosmological origin. If one assumes such deviations to be real, a model-independent formalism (cosmography) is useful for locating the source of the problem with concordance cosmology. The extraordinarily good fit of LambdaCDM to CMB data shows that it was a successful model of the universe at high redshift. Yet at lower redshift – when the dark energy density becomes significant, and its precise physical nature becomes important – the universe may have gone off the track of simple LambdaCDM. Here we use linear cosmography fits to binned Supernova data to reconstruct the detailed temporal history of the Hubble parameter, probing for interesting time-dependent behaviors of the expansion rate during and after the onset of cosmic acceleration. Using combined Type Ia supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey 5-Year data release and the Union2.1 compilation, we find intriguing hints of oscillations in the Hubble parameter during the acceleration era. While these hints are of limited statistical significance, and not robust under different redshift binnings, we present this work as a proof-of-concept demonstration of this method for reconstructing the Hubble parameter evolution, which may be useful for the voluminous Supernova data sets anticipated to become available during the next few years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TIC-65910228 b / NGTS-38 b, a 180 day transiting warm super-Jupiter</a><span class="id">[2602.12977]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery of TIC-65910228 b / NGTS-38 b, a giant exoplanet with a radius of $1.081\pm0.047$ R$_\text{J}$ and a mass of $4.78_{-0.37}^{+0.40}$ M$_\text{J}$ on a long-period ($180.52791\pm0.00038$ day), moderately eccentric ($e=0.308\pm0.011$) orbit transiting a bright (V=$10.230\pm0.020$ mag) metal rich ([Fe/H]=$0.33\pm0.09$, 'dex') F6V-F7V type host star.

Building upon the variance-based probing method \cite{Omarov_2023}, we extend this concept to the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal coupled to the resonant microwave cavity field at cryogenic temperatures, and the axion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The injected rf signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field, amplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity. While our EO-based method employs a Fabry-Pérot resonator, we do not require Michelson interferometers. Our method hence enables compact, high-frequency axion searches across the $0.5$–$50\,\mathrm{GHz}$ range. Operating at cryogenic temperatures not only suppresses thermal backgrounds but, critically, allows the probing method to mitigate quantum noise.

We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photon Accelerator in Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma</a><span class="id">[2512.16630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong magnetic fields and plasmas are intrinsically linked in both terrestrial laboratory experiments and in space phenomena. One of the most profound consequences of that is the change in relationship between the frequency and the wave number of electromagnetic waves propagating in plasma in the presence of such magnetic fields when compared to the case without these fields. Furthermore, magnetic fields alter electromagnetic wave interaction with relativistic plasma waves, resulting in different outcomes for particle and radiation generation. For a relativistic plasma wave-based photon acceleration this leads to an increased frequency gain, and, thus, potentially to higher efficiency. The influence of a magnetic field leads to quantitative and qualitative change in the properties of photon acceleration, amplifying the increase in the electromagnetic wave frequency.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Post-Newtonian Dynamics of Radiating Charges: Canonical Formulation and Binary Inspiral Laws</a><span class="id">[2512.18637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct an explicit electromagnetic analogue of the post-Newtonian Hamiltonian framework widely used in gravitational-wave physics. Starting from the Lorentz-Dirac equation and implementing Landau-Lifshitz order reduction, we derive the near-zone 1.5 PN dipole radiation-reaction force and combine it with the Darwin Hamiltonian through 1PN order to obtain a closed canonical N-body phase-space system. The equations are directly implementable, strictly conservative when dissipation is switched off, and exhibit monotonic energy loss, secular inspiral, and circularization when radiation reaction is included. For binaries we derive analytic circular and eccentric inspiral laws, including 1PN conservative corrections to the dipole-driven inspiral and merger time. Extending to charged compact binaries in Einstein-Maxwell theory, we combine the 2PN ADM-type conservative Hamiltonian with leading 1.5PN dipole dissipation and gravitational quadrupole flux, obtaining gauge-invariant energy–frequency relations, closed-form circular inspiral laws, and a dipole-quadrupole crossover scale that separates electromagnetic and gravitational flux dominated inspirals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter Heating of Compact Stars Beyond Capture: A Relativistic Framework for Energy Deposition by Particle Beams</a><span class="id">[2602.06111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, can act as detectors of energetic particle fluxes originating from astrophysical accelerators. While most existing capture and heating calculations assume isotropic very low energetic incident fluxes from the halo dark matter, many realistic sources produce highly directional beams or jets, for which gravitational focusing, trajectory multiplicity, and local energy deposition must be treated consistently. In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star. In particular, we illustrate the framework using boosted dark matter produced in a list of 324 blazars as a representative case study, computing the resulting fluxes and the associated heating in the selected stars. Additional regimes such as the interaction roof and geometric limit are discussed, highlighting the conditions under which compact objects can efficiently convert incident beam energy into observable heating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some phenomenological aspects of a quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole: quasi-periodic oscillations, scalar perturbations and thermal fluctuations</a><span class="id">[2602.15551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate several phenomenological aspects of a covariant quantum-corrected Reissner-Nordström black hole characterized by the mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, and the quantum correction parameter $\zeta$. We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.</p></div></details></article></body>
