<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01302" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Todos estos edificios se hacen de diverso modo que en Europa: Estudio arqueoastronómico de las iglesias jesuíticas de Chiquitos</a><span class="id">[2602.01302]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of the spatial layout of Christian churches has been of great interest since late Antiquity and the beginning of the Early Middle Ages, and has received a new impetus in recent literature when it was recognized that the orientation of their main axes represents a key feature of their architecture. From the earliest Christian communities, the orientation of the church allowed the faithful to pray facing the east, towards the rising Sun. Several authors were careful to point this out in their writings; in particular, prior to the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), the Apostolic Constitutions indicated: &quot;And let it be, first, the elongated building, with its head facing east&quot;. We present a detailed analysis of the spatial orientation of the historic churches located in the Jesuit towns of Chiquitania (Bolivia). We have measured in situ the main characteristics of eight churches currently standing and the ruins of a ninth construction. In all cases, we carry out a thorough survey of the landscape surrounding each church, trying to find some common pattern, possibly astronomical, that explains its orientations. To our list we also add the orientation measures of a tenth church based on work with plans and satellite maps. We complement our data with a detailed cultural and historical study of the characteristics of missionary towns. Unlike the churches of the Guarani towns of the historic province of Paraquaria where the meridian orientations stand out, in the case of the Jesuit churches of Chiquitos, half of the measured constructions show orientations that fall within the solar range, with three churches oriented equinoctially with high precision. We analyze the reasons for these orientations and delve further on the possible relevance that lighting effects could have had for the architects of these churches, which represent true hidden cathedrals in the virgin tropical forest.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Deflationary Account of Quantum Theory and its Implications for the Complex Numbers</a><span class="id">[2602.01043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Why does quantum theory need the complex numbers? With a view toward answering this question, this paper argues that the usual Hilbert-space formalism is a special case of the general method of Markovian embeddings. This paper then describes the indivisible interpretation of quantum theory, according to which a quantum system can be regarded as an indivisible stochastic process unfolding in an old-fashioned configuration space, with wave functions and other exotic Hilbert-space ingredients demoted from having an ontological status. The complex numbers end up being necessary to ensure that the Hilbert-space formalism is indeed a Markovian embedding.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demystifying the oracle: A &quot;20 Questions&quot; game to promote AI ethics and literacy</a><span class="id">[2602.01254]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As Generative AI becomes a key component in physics education, a significant ethical challenge has emerged: the tendency of students to anthropomorphize Large Language Models (LLMs), treating them as authoritative &quot;oracles&quot; that retrieve fixed facts from an internal database. However, LLMs operate fundamentally as probabilistic engines. This paper describes the design and implementation of a didactic activity, a reduced version of the &quot;20 Questions&quot; game, aimed at making this stochastic nature directly observable. Unlike a human player who fixes a target object at the start of the game, students discover that the model generates answers based solely on local coherence with the interaction history. By utilizing functionalities such as re-sampling and history rewinding, students act as experimenters, observing how identical interaction histories can yield diverging narrative paths. We discuss how mapping these behaviors to familiar physics concepts provides the epistemic scaffolding necessary to promote informed skepticism, framing the verification of AI outputs not merely as a compliance rule, but as a technical necessity derived from the system's probabilistic nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00643" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Block Diagrams to Bloch Spheres: Graphical Quantum Circuit Simulation in LabVIEW</a><span class="id">[2602.00643]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As quantum computing transitions from theoretical physics to engineering applications, there is a growing need for accessible simulation tools that bridge the gap between abstract linear algebra and practical implementation. While text-based frameworks (like Qiskit or Cirq) are standard, they often present a steep learning curve for students and engineers accustomed to graphical system design. This paper introduces QuVI (Quantum Virtual Instrument), an open-source quantum circuit toolkit developed natively within the NI LabVIEW environment. Moving beyond initial proof-of-concept models, QuVI establishes a robust framework that leverages LabVIEW's &quot;dataflow&quot; paradigm-where wires represent data and nodes represent operations-to provide an intuitive, visual analog to standard quantum circuit notation while enabling the seamless integration of classical control structures like loops and conditionals. The toolkit's capabilities are demonstrated through the construction and visualization of fundamental quantum algorithms, verifying results against theoretical predictions. By translating &quot;Block Diagrams&quot; directly into quantum state evolutions (&quot;Bloch Spheres&quot;), QuVI offers educators and researchers a powerful platform for prototyping quantum logic without leaving the graphical engineering workspace.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where's the Line? A Classroom Activity on Ethical and Constructive Use of Generative AI in Physics</a><span class="id">[2506.00229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Generative AI tools like ChatGPT are rapidly reshaping how students and instructors engage with course material – and how they think about academic integrity. This paper presents a classroom activity designed to help physics students critically examine the ethical and educational implications of using AI in coursework. Through a structured sequence of scenario analysis, boundary-setting, and reflective discussion, with optional individual policy writing, students develop the metacognitive, ethical, and collaborative capacities needed to navigate emerging technologies thoughtfully and responsibly. Grounded in research on social constructivist learning, metacognition, and ethics education, the activity positions students as co-creators of an engaged and reflective learning environment.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Eschatian Hypothesis</a><span class="id">[2512.09970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The history of astronomical discovery shows that many of the most detectable phenomena, especially detection firsts, are not typical members of their broader class, but rather rare, extreme cases with disproportionately large observational signatures. Motivated by this, we propose the Eschatian Hypothesis: that the first confirmed detection of an extraterrestrial technological civilization is most likely to be an atypical example, one that is unusually &quot;loud&quot; (i.e., producing an anomalously strong technosignature), and plausibly in a transitory, unstable, or even terminal phase. Using a toy model, we derive conditions under which such loud civilizations dominate detections, finding for example that if a society is loud for only $10^{-6}$ of its lifetime, it must emit ${\gtrsim}1$% of its total observable energy budget during that phase to outrun quieter populations. The hypothesis naturally motivates agnostic anomaly searches in wide-field, multi-channel, continuous surveys as a practical strategy for a first detection of extraterrestrial technology.</p></div></details></article></body>
