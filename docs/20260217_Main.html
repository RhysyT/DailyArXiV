In this work, we explore the impact of conversions between the dark and Standard Model photons in the primordial CMB spectral distortion epoch ($10^3 \lesssim z \lesssim 10^6$). These conversions are resonantly enhanced when the induced thermal masses of both photonic species are equal, thus leading to the possibility that sizeable distortions can be produced. To this end, we solve the Boltzmann equation at early times to determine the (irreducible) freeze-in or freeze-out abundance of dark photons. This procedure also allows us to update the limits on generic milli-charged dark sectors using the ACT DR6 bound on the number of effective radiative degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$). By then modeling the evolution of the thermal masses in both sectors, we compute the primordial CMB distortion using the Landau-Zener formalism. We find that when the dark electron and proton are roughly similar in mass (the positronium limit), current spectral distortion data from the COBE/FIRAS instrument is able to rule out novel regions of parameter space. We also forecast bounds from the proposed FOSSIL satellite, finding that spectral distortions can also be used to probe the ultra-low dark electric charge regions of parameter space, which are difficult to investigate by other means.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13404" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Interplanetary Habitable Zone</a><span class="id">[2602.13404]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The concept of a system-wide measure of the sustainment of life (habitability) for space-faring interplanetary species is introduced and explored. Although largely agnostic to the details of how interplanetary life might operate (e.g., via technology or by utilizing organism traits that are, as of now, unknown to us), some assumptions must be made about energy harvesting, orbital mobility costs, radiation risks, and resource requirements. A multi-modal figure of merit is developed for evaluating an interplanetary habitable zone (IHZ). An agent-based model is also developed to simulate the dispersal of interplanetary life in a planetary system and characterize the IHZ. For the solar system, resource weightings between planetary bodies dictate many overall behaviors, including the sequence of migration from Earth to the Moon, Mars, and asteroid belt. Comparisons with the Trappist-1 exoplanetary system also point to critical sensitivities in the balance between resource availability and risk or cost factors (e.g., radiation risks and orbital Delta-v costs) that determine the structure of an IHZ. Results suggest that our solar system may have an inherent, and significant, advantage for a space-faring species over a system like Trappist-1. This modeling approach may also have application to emerging space economies in our own solar system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LHAASO observation of Mrk 421 during 2021 March - 2024 March: a comprehensive VHE catalog of multi-timescale outbursts and its time average behavior</a><span class="id">[2602.13411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) monitors sources within its field of view for up to 7 hours daily, achieving a duty cycle exceeding 98% and an annual point-source sensitivity of 1.5% Crab Units (CU) in the very high energy (VHE) band. This unbiased sky-survey mode facilitates systematic monitoring and investigation of outburst phenomena. In this paper, we present results from an unprecedented three-year monitoring campaign (March 2021–March 2024) of Mrk421 using LHAASO, spanning energies from 0.4 TeV to 20 TeV. We find that the blazar stayed in a quiescent state in 2021 and became active starting in 2022 with a total of 23 VHE outburst events identified, where the highest observed daily significance reaches $20\,\sigma$ with a flux equivalent to approximately 3.3 CU. LHAASO's continuous monitoring suggests the flaring occupancy of Mrk 421 to be around 14%. During long-term monitoring, multiwavelength (MWL) variability and correlation analyses are conducted using complementary data from Fermi-LAT, MAXI-GSC, Swift-XRT, and ZTF. A significant correlation ($&gt;3\,\sigma$) is observed between X-ray and VHE bands with no detectable time lag, while the correlation between GeV and TeV bands is weaker. The flux distribution of the TeV emission during the quiescent state is different from that in the active state, implying the existence of two modes of energy dissipation in the blazar jet. Using simultaneous MWL data, we also analyzed both the long-term and outburst-period SEDs, and discussed the possible origin of the outburst events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13445" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Signature of Strong High-Redshift Radio Backgrounds on the Cosmic Dawn 21-cm Bispectrum</a><span class="id">[2602.13445]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurements from the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission 2 (ARCADE-2) reveal a strong radio background in the GHz frequency range. Since the cosmological 21-cm signal is measured relative to the background radiation temperature, the presence of a radio excess can significantly alter its characteristics. Previous studies have explored the impact of an inhomogeneous radio background on the global 21-cm signal and 21-cm power spectrum. This non-uniform radio background is also expected to introduce substantial non-Gaussianity. In this work, using the bispectrum, we analyze the non-Gaussianity in the 21-cm signal in the presence of an excess galactic radio background and investigate how line-of-sight radio fluctuations from early galaxies influence its nature. We find that even a moderate enhancement in radio efficiency in early galaxies significantly affects the small-scale 21-cm bispectrum. Furthermore, the delayed heating transition caused by a galactic radio background shifts the sign change in the squeezed-limit bispectrum to lower redshifts ($z\sim11$), providing a potential observational signature for distinguishing different radio background models. These results demonstrate that the 21-cm bispectrum, particularly in the squeezed limit, is highly sensitive to radio background fluctuations, making it a powerful tool for probing high-redshift radio-loud sources and the physics of the early cosmic epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust Morphology Under Changing Dust Mass Ratios in Protoplanetary Discs</a><span class="id">[2602.13463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protoplanetary disc mass is one of the most fundamental properties of a planet-forming system, as it sets the total mass budget available for planet formation. However, obtaining disc mass measurements remain challenging, since it is not possible to directly detect H$_2$, and CO abundance ratios are poorly constrained. Dynamical measurements of the disc mass are now possible, but they are not suited to all discs since the measurements typically require well-behaved emission surfaces. A long-standing method is to obtain continuum flux measurements from the dust emission, and convert to a total disc mass by assumption of the dust-to-gas mass ratio, $\epsilon$. This quantity is poorly constrained in protoplanetary discs. %
We investigate the impact of $\epsilon$ on the morphology of planet-containing hydrodynamical simulations of dusty protoplanetary accretion discs, and suggest that if a planet mass estimate can be obtained, then disc morphology could be used to constrain $\epsilon$ in observed systems relative to each other, improving the total disc mass estimates of protoplanetary discs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Neutron Star Mergers in the Absence of Gravitational Waves with Optical Afterglow Emission</a><span class="id">[2602.13471]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>With the forth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave network, which enabled the discovery of the kilonova (KN) counterpart to GW170817, ending with no new confirmed neutron star mergers, the intrinsic rate of these events must be even lower than previously estimated. As a result, building a sample of KNe will remain challenging even with continued GW observations, motivating complementary discovery strategies that do not rely on gravitational-wave triggers. In this work, we consider how leveraging bright short gamma-ray burst afterglows can aid in the discovery on KNe with the Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), whose unprecedented depth will make such detections feasible. We find that nearly on-axis (${\theta}_{\rm view} \leq 30°$) afterglows can enhance KN detection rates in the LSST $g$-band from $29^{+51}_{-21} \ \rm yr^{-1}$ to $91^{+160}_{-65} \ \rm yr^{-1}$. We further show how the colors of the observed events can be used to distinguish between neutron star merger counterparts with and without KN emission. This study demonstrates how critical multi-wavelength and multi-survey observations are for these rare events, especially without context from gravitational waves. Fortunately, detectable events will likely be discovered near peak with LSST, allowing for rapid follow-up and confirmation. We discuss key uncertainties in our study, particularly volume rate of merger events, and the degeneracy between the empirically determined explosion energy and ambient medium density.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13491" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superorbital Phase Evolution and a Soft-Hard X-ray Phase Shift in LMC X-4</a><span class="id">[2602.13491]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The superorbital period of LMC X-4 is among the most stable known in Roche-lobe overflow, high-mass X-ray binaries. We analyzed 33 years of monitoring data from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory Burst and Transient Source Experiment (CGRO BATSE), the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer All-Sky Monitor (RXTE ASM), the Neil Gehrels Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift BAT), the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image Gas Slit Camera (MAXI GSC), and the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi GBM). The measured phases show a smooth long-term trend with superposed systematic fluctuations. Fits with cubic, quartic, and sinusoidal models indicate that the quartic and sinusoidal forms provide significantly better descriptions, with the sinusoidal model yielding an $8900^{+210}_{-230}$-day modulation. Such a long timescale is unlikely to arise from orbital motion around a tertiary companion. The fluctuations resemble stochastic, glitch-like events on several-hundred-day timescales. Their rms period variation exceeds that of the smooth trend, yet the total rms period variation over 33 years remains only 0.55\%, demonstrating the exceptional stability of the superorbital period. During MJD 57000-60461, we detect a phase offset of 0.044$\pm$0.010 cycles between the soft and hard X-ray bands. This offset can be reproduced by including a higher-harmonic term in the azimuthal disk model, allowing a transition from antisymmetric to asymmetric structure. A contemporaneous decline in the hard X-ray flux suggests a partial obscuration of the emission region, similar to the anomalous low state in Her X-1. This evolving-disk scenario may also explain the superorbital phase shift previously reported in Her X-1.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cosmological Parameters (2025)</a><span class="id">[2602.13523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is a review article for The Review of Particle Physics 2026 (aka the Particle Data Book), appearing as Chapter 25.

Turbulence governs energy cascade, plasma heating, magnetic reconnection, and solar wind magnetosphere coupling, thereby influencing both ICME evolution and geoeffectiveness. While previous event-based and statistical studies have examined ICME turbulence and its radial evolution in great detail, no significant measurements of ICME magnetic turbulence at a specific vantage point have been made using multiple observatories separated azimuthally. Here, we present the first multipoint analysis of MHD turbulence across ICME plasma regions, using four spacecraft at the Sun-Earth L1 point, separated by 80 RE along the dawn-dusk direction. Previous studies reveal that ICME shocks, sheaths, and magnetic clouds are highly non-uniform, with strong azimuthal variability. Using high-resolution magnetic field observations from ISRO's Aditya-L1, NASA's Wind and ACE, and NOAA's DSCOVR, we analyze turbulence associated with the 10th October 2024 solar storm, which triggered the second-strongest geomagnetic storm of solar cycle 25. Our results reveal significant variability and differing turbulence maturity across small separations, supported by analysis of field-aligned and perpendicular magnetic field cascades, indicating strong anisotropies. Sheath turbulence is substantially modified by shock induced energy injection. Evidence of compressible turbulence and plasma energization at the flux rope interaction region indicates that internal processes, such as magnetic reconnection, strongly influence ICME plasma evolution, highlighting pronounced spatial variability in turbulence and plasma states observed by multiple L1 monitors near Earth and underscoring their potential role in space weather impacts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13677" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar active region scaling laws revisited</a><span class="id">[2602.13677]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The systematic variation of solar active region (AR) properties with their magnetic flux has been the subject of numerous studies but the proposed scaling laws still vary rather widely. A correct representation of these laws and the deviations from them is important for modelling the source term in surface flux transport and dynamo models of space climate variation, and it may also help constrain the subsurface origin of active regions. Here we determine active region scaling laws based on the recently constructed ARISE active region data base listing bipolar ARs for cycle 23, 24 and 25. For the area $A$, pole separation $d$ and tilt angle $\gamma$ we find scalings against magnetic flux $\Phi$ and heliographic latitude $\lambda$. Residuals from these relations are also modelled. These scaling relations are recommended for use in space climate research for the modelling of future data or missing past data, as well as for the identification of candidate rogue ARs. We confirm that the tilt angle distribution of non-Hale ARs shows a significant excess at low tilts (anti-Hale ARs). In contrast to earlier studies we show that neither the anti-Hale ARs nor non-Hales in general follow Joy's law: instead, their tilt angle distribution is best represented by vanishing mean tilt. These results are most easily reconciled with a scenario where the AR flux loops originate in the deep convective zone or below, gaining tilt during their rise under the action of the Coriolis force. A small fraction of the loops is subjected to extreme, intermittent torques resulting in either very large tilts or anti-Hale orientation. Anti-Hale ARs are suggested to be fully curled `XO-loops', and their excess is caused by a simple mechanical effect, as the contact of their legs increases resistance against further deformation by the torque.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of Cyclotron Absorption in the Radio Emission of GPM 1839-10</a><span class="id">[2602.13742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GPM 1839-10 is an intriguing long-period radio transient (LPT), distinguished by its activity spanning at least three decades and its highly unusual emission characteristics. These features include orthogonal polarization mode (OPM) switches, down-drifting sub-structures, and distinct linear-to-circular polarization conversion behaviors. In this work, we present follow-up observations utilizing the FAST telescope at L-band, yielding a total of seven detected radio pulses. We find a consistent association between OPM switches and a decrease in polarized intensity. This feature strongly supports the hypothesis that the OPM switches are generated by the incoherent summation of OPMs. Our measured Rotation Measures (RMs) are consistent with previous observations, indicating that the magneto-ionic environment is stable. If the source is in a binary system, such stability suggests it may host a weakly magnetized companion. Crucially, we firstly observe clear evidence of a cyclotron absorption feature in one radio pulse, a signature rarely observed in radio sources. This feature allows us to infer that the magnetic field strength at the absorption site has a lower limit of tens of Gauss, which is necessary for the phenomenon to occur. This characteristic can be explained in a scenario where GPM 1839-10 possesses a weakly magnetized companion star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13777" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Preconditions for Ice Formation in Supernova Remnant and Cloud Interactions: A 2D MHD Study</a><span class="id">[2602.13777]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Water ice has been detected in several supernova remnants despite the strong heating and radiation in these environments. This challenges standard expectations for dust survival. Using two dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we study how a supernova shock interacts with a dense interstellar cloud. The simulations show that the shock naturally compresses the cloud into dense structures similar to those inferred in well known remnants. Although temperatures remain high in the adiabatic phase, simple considerations indicate that cooling would act quickly once included. These results suggest that shock cloud interactions create the physical conditions needed for water ice to form. Future work including radiative cooling and grain surface chemistry will allow direct modelling of ice growth in these compressed regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13815" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimatingthe Contribution of Galactic Neutrino Sources</a><span class="id">[2602.13815]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Milky Way hosts astrophysical accelerators capable of producing high-energy cosmic rays. These cosmic rays can interact with the interstellar medium (ISM) across the Galaxy to produce neutrinos and gamma rays (propagation component), while their interactions with ambient material at their acceleration sites, such as supernova remnants, can give rise to the source component of the gamma-ray and neutrino flux. In this paper, we estimate the source component of the Galactic neutrino flux using simulated populations of Galactic gamma-ray sources. We compare our results with observations from neutrino experiments in the energy range of 1-30 TeV. Using simulated populations of Galactic TeV gamma-ray sources, we exploit the correlation between gamma rays and neutrinos and introduce a bracketing approach to constrain the range for the source contribution of the Galactic neutrino flux. For the upper limit, we used a simulation describing the entity of Galactic gamma-ray sources, whereas the lower limit was estimated using the hadronic component of the Galactic supernova remnant population. Our results show that the difference between this maximum and minimum is less than an order of magnitude and the flux range is comparable to the Galactic neutrino flux from the cosmic-ray interaction with the ISM. The results agree with the observed signals from IceCube and ANTARES and suggest that the propagation component, combined with the minimum source contribution predicted by the supernova-remnant model, approaches the observed neutrino flux, leaving little room for significant enhancements of the emission originating from propagating cosmic rays.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three-dimensional kink modes in solar coronal slabs: group velocities and their implications for impulsively excited waves</a><span class="id">[2602.13952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Little attention has been paid to group velocities of three-dimensional (3D) MHD waves in solar coronal seismology. This study aims to present a rather comprehensive examination on the group velocities of trapped 3D kink modes in coronal slabs, emphasizing the connection of mode analysis to both mode characterization and impulsively excited 3D kink waves. We work in linear, ideal, pressureless MHD, and take the equilibrium slab to be symmetrically structured only in one transverse direction. The dispersion relation is numerically solved, with the results understood by making in-depth analytical progress. We address both the transverse fundamental and its first overtone. We develop a three-subgroup scheme for categorizing 3D kink modes on the plane spanned by the axial and out-of-plane wavenumbers. The group ($\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$) and phase velocities ($\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$) sit on the same side of the equilibrium magnetic field ($\vec{B}_0$) for the “$\vec{B}_0$-same-side A” and “$\vec{B}_0$-same-side F” subgroups, which are further discriminated by the directional similarity of $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{B}_0$. The “$\vec{B}_0$-straddling” subgroup is peculiar in that $\vec{v}_{\rm gr}$ and $\vec{v}_{\rm ph}$ lie astride $\vec{B}_0$, a feature that cannot be found for waves in unbounded uniform media in pressureless MHD. This “$\vec{B}_0$-straddling” subgroup pertains to both the fundamental and its overtones. We further place our results in the context of impulsive waves, employing the method of stationary phase to predict the large-time wavefront morphology in the plane of symmetry of the equilibrium slab. Wavefronts directed toward $\vec{B}_0$ derive exclusively from “$\vec{B}_0$-straddling” modes, and are confined to narrow sectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superhumps and their Relation to the Disk Instability Model</a><span class="id">[2602.13996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Since the discovery of superhumps in 1974, these photometric modulations have provided a crucial observational window into disk instabilities in cataclysmic variable stars, particularly the tidal instability associated with the 3:1 resonance. Over the past few decades, extensive time-resolved photometry has revealed a rich diversity of superhump-related phenomena, including delayed superhump development, early superhumps in WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, systematic stage A-B-C evolution, negative superhumps, and superhumps observed in related systems such as intermediate polars and AM CVn stars. In this invited review, we summarize key observational advances since the establishment of the thermal-tidal instability framework, discuss their theoretical interpretations within the disk instability model, and highlight remaining open problems. These developments have been driven by coordinated networks of amateur observers, wide-field robotic surveys, and continuous high-precision space-based photometry from Kepler and TESS. Together, they demonstrate that superhumps remain a powerful probe of disk dynamics, binary parameters, and the interplay between thermal, tidal, and geometric effects in accretion disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14014" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar Timing Array in the past decade</a><span class="id">[2602.14014]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The past decade has been a transformative period for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and their search for nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). This progress has been driven by collective advances in instrumentation for pulsar timing observations, increasingly sophisticated data-analysis techniques, and improved theoretical understanding of the origins of nanohertz GW signals. PTA sensitivity has steadily improved, leading first to progressively more stringent upper limits on the gravitational-wave background (GWB), and subsequently to the identification of a common red-noise process in pulsar timing data, the first hint of a GWB. In 2023, multiple PTA collaborations reported evidence for the Hellings-Downs correlation, widely regarded as the definitive signature of a GWB. These developments place PTAs on the threshold of a confident GW detection and the opening of a new low-frequency window on the GW Universe. In this article, we present an overview of PTA experiments, with particular emphasis on the rapid progress achieved during this pivotal period for PTA and nanohertz GW science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14052" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Lorentz Violation using 21cm and CMB Cross Correlations</a><span class="id">[2602.14052]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lorentz symmetry is a fundamental pillar of modern Physics, yet high-energy theories often predict its violation. One potential signature of such a violation is cosmic birefringence - rotation of the polarization plane of photons due to Chern-Simons coupling in Maxwell's electrodynamics. This rotation angle, aka birefringence angle, depends upon the distance travelled by the photon and is thus different for CMB and 21cm photons. While the rotation angle in CMB, i.e., $\alpha_\mathrm{CMB}$, has been tightly constrained by CMB experiments, the potential of the 21cm cosmological signal to constrain this parameter, as well as constrain $\alpha_\mathrm{21cm}$, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we provide constraints on both these angles by cross-correlating 21cm and CMB signals. Using the Fisher matrix formalism, we give our forecasts for 21cm experiments, including SKA, HIRAX, and PUMA, and Planck like CMB experiment. We find that best constraints $\sigma_{\alpha_\mathrm{CMB}} \sim 4.4^\circ$ and $\sigma_{\alpha_\mathrm{21cm}} \sim 100^\circ$ are found using $C_\ell^{T_{21} B_\mathrm{CMB}}$ and $C_\ell^{T_{21} B_{21}}$ respectively. Since birefringence hasn't yet been detected in 21cm, we choose the fiducial value $\alpha_\mathrm{21cm}^\mathrm{fid}=0$ assuming the null hypothesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14145" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematic Evidence for Open Cluster Origins of Galactic Binary Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2602.14145]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the potential birthplace of Galactic binary neutron star (BNS) systems through a kinematic analysis. Using high-precision astrometry from Gaia DR3, updated pulsar distances, and Monte Carlo sampling of astrometric errors, we integrate the past trajectories of 11 Galactic BNSs and 167 globular clusters plus 2967 open clusters, to search for past encounters. Our results suggest that BNS origin in globular clusters is unlikely, with low encounter probabilities (e.g., $\lesssim 0.5\%$ for NGC 5139) and requiring excessive ejection velocities. Conversely, our analysis indicates that open clusters are a non-negligible formation channel. Specifically, the double pulsar J0737$-$3039 shows a $13.9\%$ ($5.4\%$) probability of originating from the young cluster OC 0450 (Theia 58). Based on encounter proximity and time, we argue that Theia 58 is its more plausible birthplace.

These phenomena are probably common to other galactic nuclei and may explain the feedback processes between nuclear regions and galaxies, so important for the overall evolution of the Universe. The Galactic center HE emission is very complex and consists of both thermal and non thermal radiation produced by compact and extended sources, surrounded by more diffuse components. All these objects and media are interacting with each other in the narrow and dense Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). Some of them also show relevant extensions towards the Galactic poles, indicating energetic outflows that seem to link the center to the recently observed large Galactic polar structures. In spite of the fundamental advances obtained in the last twenty five years with the most sensitive X-ray and gamma-ray observatories, several questions remain open to investigations. We review here the main observational results and the open issues on the high-energy diagnostics of the Galactic nuclear activity, focusing on processes that take place in the CMZ, and in particular discussing the role of the present and past SMBH activities in powering this region and possibly the whole Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diversities and similarities exhibited by multi-planetary systems and their architectures: II. Radii of singles and multis</a><span class="id">[2602.14194]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovered planets in apparent single-planet systems (singles) and those in systems with multiple detected planets (multis) exhibit a rich diversity of physical and orbital properties. We investigate the differences and similarities between 1730 singles and 1522 multis in a catalogue of confirmed transiting planets orbiting main-sequence stars with spectral classes ranging from late-M to late-F. After we removed the hot Jupiters, the planet types and their fractional numbers were similar for the multis and singles hosted by FGK-type stars. Furthermore, the median radii of both the singles and the multis increase with host star temperature already from late- to early-type M dwarfs and further up to F stars. Our analyses show that the singles are larger on average than the multis in our F, G, K, and M samples. However, after we excluded the hot Jupiters, the radius distributions of the singles and multis orbiting FGK stars are statistically indistinguishable, particularly at $R &lt; 4\, R_\oplus$. In the FGK sample, we also identified an unexpected and significant overabundance of multis, compared to singles, at radii of $\approx1.4-1.6\, R_\oplus$. For the early- and late-type M samples, our work indicates that the multis are smaller on average than the singles and that the radius distributions of the multis and singles are different, except for the planets with $R &lt; 4\, R_\oplus$ hosted by early-type M dwarfs. Nevertheless, these results for the two M samples are inconclusive because the sample sizes of 167 and 101 planets are limited. In conclusion, our analyses reveal that the singles and multis, excluding the hot Jupiters, orbiting FGK stars are overall consistent with originating from the same underlying population based on their planet types and radii. This interpretation is, however, not applicable within the region of the overabundance of multis identified in this work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration with upstream escape reproduces DAMPE observations</a><span class="id">[2602.14196]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a self-consistent nonlinear extension of diffusive shock acceleration that incorporates cosmic ray (CR) backreaction on the shock precursor together with a physically motivated upstream-escape mechanism that produces an exponential high energy cutoff. The CR pressure gradient decelerates the upstream flow facing the shock wave, generating an extended precursor in which higher rigidity particles sample a larger cumulative velocity gradient and thereby acquire a progressively harder spectrum. Finite-size/escape effects are modeled by a momentum-dependent loss term, which naturally terminates acceleration and steepens the spectrum near the cutoff. The precursor compression ratio is not imposed as a closure condition but is determined dynamically by requiring consistency between the injection rate inferred from thermal leakage at the subshock and the injection strength demanded by the nonlinear shock modification, with CR-driven wave heating providing stabilizing negative feedback. Applying the model to young supernova-remnant-like parameters and standard one-zone Galactic diffusion, we reproduce the main features of the latest DAMPE proton spectrum: gradual hardening from hundreds of GeV to multi-TeV energies and a subsequent exponential cutoff at tens of TeV. The resulting spectral evolution follows directly from the competition between precursor-mediated nonlinear feedback and upstream escape.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Fe K X-ray reverberation lag in the energy-resolved spectra of Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ton S180</a><span class="id">[2602.14197]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the Fe K relativistic reverberation feature for the first time in the Narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Ton S180.

The lag amplitude drops to $22.85\pm14.20$ s as the frequency increases to $(8.5-30) \times 10^{-4}$ Hz. The time-averaged spectrum of the source shows a relatively narrow Fe K line at $\sim6.4$ keV, resulting in black hole spin to be low ($a=\rm 0.43_{-0.14}^{+0.10}$) found from the reflection modelling. We perform general relativistic transfer function modelling of the lag energy spectra individually. This provides an independent timing-based measure of the spin at $a=0.30_{-0.17}^{+0.34}$, and black hole mass $M_{\rm BH} = 0.29_{-0.16}^{+0.01}\times10^8M_{\odot}$, comparable to the previous measurement, and height of the corona $h = 2.59_{-0.33}^{+5.17}r_{\rm g}$.

Unusually, the interaction operates in a regime that is relativistic yet sub-Alfvénic. Electromagnetic draping amplifies magnetic fields in a narrow layer near the stellar surface, leading to the generation of electric currents along the local magnetic field.

Detecting complex organic molecules (COMs), essential for prebiotic chemistry, is crucial to assessing their potential. Though COMs remain undetected on these moons, ESA's JUICE and NASA's Europa Clipper missions aim to fill this gap with their science payloads. This study explores the formation and transport of COMs within Jupiter's circumplanetary disk (CPD), a critical environment for the formation of the Galilean moons. Using a time-dependent model that couples the evolving CPD structure with the dynamics of icy particles of varying sizes and release times, we assess two primary COM formation pathways: thermal processing of ices and UV photochemistry. The results indicate that heating, particularly of NH3:CO2 ices, occurs efficiently before substantial irradiation, making it the dominant pathway for COM formation in the Jovian CPD. However, the relative efficiencies of these two processes are governed by particle density, disk viscosity, accretion rate, and UV flux, which collectively determine drift timescales and exposure to favorable thermodynamic environments. Existing models indicate that Europa's accretion was relatively cold and prolonged, possibly allowing some COMs to survive incorporation, whereas Ganymede and Callisto likely formed under even cooler conditions conducive to preserving COM-rich material. These results highlight the potential inheritance of complex organics by the Galilean moons and offer a framework for interpreting upcoming compositional data from JUICE and Europa Clipper.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14343" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric constraints on GJ 1214 b from CRIRES+ and prospects for characterisation with ANDES</a><span class="id">[2602.14343]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we aim to constrain the atmospheric composition of GJ 1214 b using all available transits observed with the upgraded CRIRES+ spectrograph at the VLT by searching for the signatures of water vapour, methane, and carbon dioxide. We analysed eight CRIRES+ transit datasets covering the K band (1.90-2.45 microns) at a resolving power of R   100,000. We used the SysRem algorithm to correct for telluric and stellar contributions and employed the cross-correlation technique with templates from petitRADTRANS to search for H2O, CH4, and CO2. Injection-recovery tests across a grid of metallicities (Z) and cloud-deck pressures (pc) were performed to quantify detection limits. We also generated predictions for ANDES observations using end-to-end simulated datasets with EXoPLORE. We detect no significant H2O, CH4, or CO2 signatures. Injection-recovery tests show that such non-detections exclude atmospheres with low-altitude clouds and moderate or low metallicities. CH4 yields the tightest empirical limits, with CO2 unexpectedly ruling out intermediate metallicities (  100xsolar) with clouds deeper due to its rapidly rising opacity in compressed, high-Z atmospheres. Our constraints are in line with either a high-Z or a high-altitude aerosol layer, in agreement with recent JWST inferences. The combined analysis of eight CRIRES+ datasets provides the most stringent high-resolution constraints on the atmospheric properties of GJ 1214 b to date. Simulations of a single transit observed with ANDES on the ELT predict modest improvements for H2O, a substantially expanded detectable region for CH4, and the strongest gains for CO2, making the latter a particularly effective tracer for characterising high-metallicity atmospheres in sub-Neptunes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estimation of neutron star mass and radius of FRB 20240114A by identification of crustal oscillations</a><span class="id">[2602.14353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>By identifying quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) reported in FRB 20240114A (from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) with neutron star crustal torsional oscillations, together with experimental constraints on the incompressibility $K_0$ of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation density, we constrain the mass and radius of an extragalactic neutron star at redshift $z\approx0.13$. Identifying the low-order QPO frequencies as fundamental oscillations, and frequencies of $567.7\,\mathrm{Hz}$ or $655.5\,\mathrm{Hz}$ (rest frame) as first overtone candidates, implies neutron star mass ranges of $1.00$–$1.55\,M_\odot$ or $1.17$–$1.76\,M_\odot$, respectively. The radius is also constrained, with a self-consistent value around $13$ km, further supported by the calculation of the NS structure within the low-mass/low-central density regime. Simultaneously, we also constrain another nuclear saturation parameter, namely the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density (i.e., the slope parameter), $L$, and determine it to be $L=59.5-96.8$ MeV with $\sim 10\%$ systematic uncertainty, which is broadly consistent with previous constraints on $L$ obtained from experiments and astronomical observations. Thus, a mapping of FRB QPOs to crustal torsional modes seems reasonable. This can be confirmed with upcoming FRB surveys over a broad range of redshifts and more elaborate data analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quintessence with tachyonic resonance and late-time cosmic-microwave-background and gravitational-wave signals</a><span class="id">[2602.14389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Combinations of recent cosmological observations, including Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), show hints of a dynamical nature for dark energy. While the data suggest the possibility of the phantom crossing, it is worth thoroughly exploring quintessence models. Given that phenomenological parametrisations of the equation-of-state parameter $w(a)$ with a sharp transitional feature fit the data well, we study the realisation of such models in quintessence. In the late Universe, the quintessence field begins to oscillate abruptly, changing the behaviour of $w$. Naturally, such a model entails tachyonic instability, and particle production modifies $w$. We perform numerical lattice simulations to study the time dependence of $w$. In addition, the violent particle production produces significant density perturbations and the stochastic gravitational-wave background, whose characteristic scale depends on the mass scale of the quintessence around the minimum of the potential. We discuss the observability of these late-time cosmological signals through cosmic microwave background, quasar astrometry, pulsar timing arrays, and other observational probes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14427" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Physical Properties of PS1-12sk and the Implications to Its Progenitor System</a><span class="id">[2602.14427]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PS1-12sk is a type Ibn supernova (SN) found at the host environment showing no obvious ongoing star formation, which challenges the massive star explosion scenario. We use the ejecta-circumstellar medium (CSM) interaction (CSI) and the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni models in the context of double white dwarf (WD) merger to fit the bolometric light curve (LC) of PS1-12sk, since the He emission lines at the photospheric phases indicated the interaction between the SN ejecta and He-rich CSM. We find that the CSI model failed to explain the LC, but the CSI plus $^{56}$Ni model can account for the bolometric LC. The derived masses of the two WDs and $^{56}$Ni are $\sim 0.70 M_\odot$, $\sim 0.40 M_\odot$, and $\sim 0.09\,M_\odot$, respectively. The facts that the ejecta mass ($\sim 0.984 M_\odot$) is well below the Chandrasekhar limit ($\sim 1.4 M_\odot$) and that the $^{56}$Ni mass is comparable to the $^{56}$Ni yields of the explosions of some sub-Chandrasekhar explosion models support the scenario that PS1-12sk might be from a sub-Chandrasekhar explosion induced by the merger of two low-mass WDs. The derived innermost radius ($\sim 13.81 \times 10^{12}$ cm) and the mass of the CSM ($\sim 0.116 M_\odot$) disfavor the possibility that the CSM was formed in the merger phase.

Within the Novikov-Thorne thin-disk model, the radiative flux, effective temperature, and spectral luminosity are studied, and by adopting observational parameters relevant to SgrA* and M87*, concrete examples of the rotating SV black holes are calculated and compared with that of the Kerr black holes. The results show that the parameter $g$ suppresses the maximum values of these quantities. In addition, using a backward ray-tracing technique, we numerically simulate the optical appearance of rotating SV black holes and analyze the corresponding intensity images, redshift and observed flux distributions. Our results show that these quantities are affected by $g$. In particular, as $g$ increases, the observed intensity is significantly suppressed and the photon ring region has remarkable increase in its width. Our findings suggest that accretion-disk-related observables may provide important avenues to distinguish rotating SV black holes and Kerr black holes, and offer theoretical guidance for future high-resolution observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zel'dovich smearing approximation of the BAO feature for model-agnostic cosmological inference</a><span class="id">[2602.14533]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A model-agnostic description of the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature in redshift space requires a number of ingredients. Physically, one must describe the impact of cosmological bulk flows which progressively and anisotropically smear out the feature over time. One must also model the effects of the scale dependence of tracer bias and the mode coupling between short and long scales. All of these can be incorporated using the Zel'dovich approximation alone, without reference to any particular cosmological model. On the technical front, one needs a robust, complete and cosmology-independent basis to describe the shape of the real space BAO feature in linear theory, which can then be propagated to the nonlinearly evolved, measured feature in redshift space. In this work, we describe how these ingredients – which we have systematically constructed in recent work – come together in an accurate framework capable of describing the BAO-scale pairwise measurements of state-of-the-art galaxy surveys. Using mock observations and $N$-body simulations, we show that our template-free framework can produce unbiased and precise cosmological constraints for samples with realistic levels of nonlinearity. This work represents one of the final steps in constructing a data-ready analysis framework for model-agnostic cosmological inference from the BAO feature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14547" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiscale feature integration network for inpainting of full-sky CMB $B$-modes</a><span class="id">[2602.14547]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Foreground masking and incomplete sky coverage complicate CMB polarization analyses by inducing mode coupling and imperfect E/B separation, with particularly strong impact on searches for primordial $B$-modes. We present SkyReconNet-P, a convolutional neural network for inpainting CMB polarization maps that extends the SkyReconNet framework to jointly reconstruct the polarization $(Q,U)$ maps from partial-sky observations. The method combines regional processing with a hybrid design, utilizing standard convolution and dilated convolution to do a multiscale feature integration. We evaluate performance at both the map and power spectrum level using two masking scenarios: a generated random mask and the Planck 2018 common polarization inpainting mask. For both masking scenarios, SkyReconNet-P reproduces the large-scale morphology of the target maps. In power-spectrum space, we find that the reconstructed $E$-mode spectrum closely tracks the target at low multipoles, while small biases emerge at higher $\ell$. For $B$-mode, the raw reconstructed spectra exhibit a larger multipole-dependent bias, which we mitigate using a simulation-based linear calibration. We show that the calibrated $B$-mode spectrum preserve more information by comparing it with spectrum estimation using pseudo-$C_\ell$. Finally, we demonstrate cosmological parameter inference from calibrated reconstructed spectra by fitting $(r, A_{\rm lens})$ with a Gaussian bandpower likelihood, recovering posteriors consistent with injected parameters across three test ensembles down to $r \sim 10^{-3}$. These results support inpainting as a complementary route to cut-sky approaches when downstream pipelines can greatly benefit from statistically well-characterized, gap-filled polarization maps.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14567" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Human versus Artificial Intelligence; various significant examples in astrophysics</a><span class="id">[2602.14567]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In a recent arXiv posting [1] I reported the result of an experiment: asking this http URL to compare three items concerning (ordinary) Gamma Ray Burts (GRBs): the data, the standard paradigm(s) and the &quot;Cannonball&quot; (CB) model.

They have been recently measured in the cores of red giant stars using asteroseismology. It was shown that core magnetic fields, if unaccounted for, can bias the measurements of the gravity offset $\epsilon_g$, which is otherwise well characterised for red giants. Exploiting this bias as a way to detect magnetic fields in the cores of red giants, we wish to increase the number of magnetic field detections in red giants, but also to establish a method that could be widely applicable to all red giants. We selected 218 Kepler red giants showing abnormal measured values of $\epsilon_g$. We used robust statistical criteria based on the expected lifetime of mixed modes to identify significant modes. We then adjusted an asymptotic expression for mixed modes to the observed frequencies, taking magnetic field and rotation into account, using Bayesian inference. We then assessed the probability of magnetic field detection and measured the magnetic field intensity using stellar models for the favourable cases. We found new magnetic red giant stars with fields ranging from 34 to 260 kG. For these stars, we measured values for $\epsilon_g$ now in agreement with the expected value. Adding these new detections to those of previous studies, we showed that the mass distribution of magnetic giants is similar to that of the complete catalogue of red giants, but different from the mass distribution of red giants with suppressed dipole modes. We also found that the core rotation of magnetic red giants follows a similar distribution as red giants in general. This could either mean that the detected fields do not have a predominant impact on the redistribution of angular momentum, or that other red giants also harbour an internal field that is currently non-detectable or has not yet been detected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Cosmic Void Finding with Graph Flows</a><span class="id">[2602.14630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic voids contain higher-order cosmological information and are of interest for astroparticle physics.

Our algorithm uses a deep graph neural network to evolve &quot;test particles&quot; according to a flow-matching objective. We demonstrate the method in a simplified example setting but outline steps to generalize it towards practically usable void finders. Trained on a deterministic teacher, the model performs well but has considerable stochasticity which we interpret as regularization. Cosmological information in the predicted void catalogs outperforms the teacher. On the one hand, our method can cheaply emulate existing void finders with apparently useful regularization. More importantly, it also allows us to find the Bayes-optimal mapping between observed galaxies and any void definition.

The region consists of a supernova remnant (SNR, RX J0852.0-4622) with a shell-like morphology, commonly referred to as Vela Junior, and a pulsar denoted PSR J0855-4644. Pulsars are among the most efficient leptonic accelerators in our Galaxy, making this region particularly interesting to study. We utilise the most recent data taken by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.), to investigate any {\gamma}-ray emission associated with the pulsar in this region, PSR J0855-4644. We applied a full forward folding method on the H.E.S.S. data. Utilising 3D modelling techniques, we evaluated the TeV {\gamma}-ray emission towards the various components of this complex system. The distinct energy-dependent morphology observed in our data motivates further investigation of this source. We resolved the emission in the Vela Junior region into various components, several of which correspond to the SNR itself. In particular, we find a new extended component which is coincident with the position of PSR J0855-4644. The spectrum follows a power-law distribution with a best-fit index of {\Gamma}E = 1.81 \pm 0.07stat which differs from the properties of the surrounding {\gamma}-ray emission of the Vela Junior SNR. A one-zone leptonic joint fit between the X-rays (from XMM-Newton) and {\gamma}-rays (from H.E.S.S.) leads to a lower limit on the magnetic field of 1.6{\mu}G and a spectral index of {\alpha} = 1.88 \pm 0.01, in line with expectations of pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). In this paper, we report the first detection of the PWN of PSR J0855-4644 at TeV energies with the H.E.S.S. experiment at a significance of 12.2{\sigma}. This is attributed to the advanced techniques of the 3D analysis. Based on the pulsar's characteristics, its PWN is consistent with the known TeV PWNe population in the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14695" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4U 1556-60 as a very faint neutron star X-ray binary at 700 pc with an undetected radio jet</a><span class="id">[2602.14695]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>4U 1556-60 is a low-mass X-ray binary that was discovered more than 50 years ago as a persistent X-ray source; however, very little was known about it.

We conclude that a scenario in which 4U 1556-60 is a candidate ultracompact neutron star X-ray binary at a distance of  700 pc is able to explain the observed properties of the source. It resides at a persistent X-ray luminosity of  2x10^34 erg/s, an unusual value for a typical X-ray binary, but similar to several ultracompact systems. The ratio of the X-ray to optical luminosity is very high, also suggesting a physically small accretion disk. The radio jet is undetected with a very deep upper limit of 3x10^25 erg/s, which is about 10^3 times fainter than the expected black hole jet correlation, strongly indicating a neutron star accretor. The X-ray spectrum is dominated by a power law, and the X-ray timing properties are also consistent with observations of other very low accretion rate X-ray binaries. No spin or orbital periodicity are found in the X-ray data. Future observations, especially to determine its orbital period, will further aid in understanding 4U 1556-60.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bounds on Lorentz invariance violation from muon fluctuations at the Pierre Auger Observatory</a><span class="id">[2602.14720]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum gravity theories often modify spacetime symmetries. In particular, Lorentz invariance may be violated when approaching the Planck scale. Although the scales at which interactions occur in extensive air showers induced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere are many orders of magnitude below the Planck scale, these violations might still be observable. In this work, the fluctuations in the number of muons in the extensive air showers measured at the Pierre Auger Observatory are exploited, for the first time, to constrain Lorentz invariance violations. The bounds derived in the hadronic sector are the strongest ever obtained, and do not rely on assumptions about the mass composition of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. The fluctuations in the number of muons constitute a new and powerful observable to further explore Lorentz invariance in a region of the parameter space not accessible to other observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Non-minimal coupling using ultra-diffuse galaxies</a><span class="id">[2602.14747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether a non-minimal coupling between dark matter and gravity can influence the internal dynamics of ultra-diffuse galaxies. Within this framework, the gravitational potential is modified by an additional term that captures the interaction between spacetime curvature and the dark matter with a coupling constant determined by a length scale $L$. Using spherical Jeans modeling, we analyze the kinematic data of three ultra-diffuse galaxies namely: NGC 1052-DF2, NGC 1052-DF4, and Dragonfly 44, which span the observational extremes from dark matter deficient to dark matter dominated systems. For each galaxy we explore several dark matter halo profiles, two orbital anisotropy models, and both with and without Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation scenarios, and we perform a Bayesian parameter inference. Our results show that across all the considered configurations, the constrained astrophysical parameters are consistent with standard ones from General Relativity. The posterior distributions of $L$ show no preference for non-zero values and result only in upper limits, suggesting that any non-minimal coupling contribution must be small and perturbative on this scales. Future high precision velocity measurements will be essential to determine whether non-minimal coupling effects can become observationally distinguishable in low-acceleration systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pulsar based modeling of point spread function of Fermi Large Area Telescope</a><span class="id">[2602.14764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sensitivity of searches for extended emission around gamma-ray sources is naturally limited by the precision of the knowledge of the Point Spread Function (PSF) of gamma-ray telescopes.

We explore uncertainties in the Fermi/LAT PSF by comparing the PSF models provided by the Fermi/LAT Instrument Response Functions (IRFs) with signals of bright pulsars. We compare the analytical PSF models of Fermi/LAT IRFs with pulsar data and fit the pulsar data with the same analytical model as in the Fermi/LAT IRFs to derive an improved set of PSF parameters.

These relations have been difficult to study for Galactic LPVs because their distances were poorly known in the past. We aim to establish the PL relations of solar-neighbourhood Miras for several near-IR photometric bands. To this end, we used multi-epoch photometry from the DIRBE and unTimely/WISE catalogues, Gaia parallax distances, and contemporary pulsation periods obtained from optical observations of a well-selected sample of solar-neighbourhood Miras. We show that clearly defined PL relations in the nine investigated near-IR bands emerge from our data, and we report the slopes and zero-point magnitudes. We find that Galactic Miras are fainter in the near-IR than their Large Magellanic Cloud siblings. We derive average period-temperature, period-bolometric-luminosity, and period-radius relations from fits to synthetic SEDs constructed from the PL relations. By applying AGB evolutionary models, the scatter of stars around the PL sequences can also be used to test whether the parallax uncertainties quoted in the Gaia catalogue are realistic. Furthermore, we performed such tests based on a comparison with parallaxes obtained with the VLBI and with a sample of LPVs in the globular cluster 47 Tuc. We conclude that, for Galactic Miras with a fractional parallax uncertainty of &lt;0.1 in the Gaia catalogue, the parallax uncertainty is underestimated by factors between 1.0 and 1.7, and most likely by $\sim1.3$. For more uncertain parallaxes, we find evidence that the distances (parallaxes) are generally overestimated (underestimated). Nevertheless, we find strong evidence that the large error-inflation factors reported for AGB stars in the literature are unrealistic. Our results lend confidence to the parallax measurements of these highly extended, variable stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for the merger hypothesis in V4332 Sgr: a low $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio and multiple outbursts</a><span class="id">[2602.14781]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Following the detections of the first extragalactic “Luminous Red Nova” (LRN) M31 RV in 1989, and its first Galactic counterpart V4332 Sgr in 1994, there have been many discoveries of similar, or closely related, objects. They are important because they bridge the luminosity gap between the brightest novae and supernovae, a largely unexplored parameter space. The cause of eruptions in LRNe is still unclear, a stellar merger being the most favored mechanism. However, barring V1309 Sco, there has been no direct evidence for a merger in the other objects. Here we present strong evidence that V4332 Sgr was a merger event. High resolution infrared observations of the CO fundamental band show an unusually small $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio of $3.5\pm1$. This indicates that a violent event had occurred, whose effects penetrated deep enough to allow CNO cycle processed $^{13}$C in the inner H burning shell to be brought to the surface. We rule out planetary ingestion, and propose that the eruption was due to a merger between V4332 Sgr and a companion star. It is shown that V4332 Sgr was likely surrounded by an edge-on disk before its eruption. If this disk was a flattened common envelope containing V4332 Sgr and a companion star, then a merger scenario would not be inconsistent. Furthermore, V4332 Sgr had multiple outbursts, previously unreported but an important piece of information, since multiple outbursts are a trait shared by many LRNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of the formation channel on gravitational-wave-galaxy cross-correlations</a><span class="id">[2602.14825]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The angular, harmonic cross-correlation between gravitational wave (GW) events and galaxy catalogues contains rich information on the large-scale structure and the origin of compact binary mergers. In this work, we study how uncertainties in the binary formation channel affect the predicted cross-correlation signal for both current-generation and next-generation networks of detectors. We generate five mock GW catalogues for which we vary the progenitor-to-remnant mass-transfer function and the time-delay probability distribution between progenitor and remnant. We then cross-correlate these catalogues with galaxy samples modelled on the 2MASS Photometric Redshift catalogue (2MPZ) and the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalogue (Quaia). We find that the mass-transfer function has negligible effect on the cross-correlation signal, with differences remaining within redshift uncertainties. In contrast, the time-delay distribution dramatically affects the redshift distribution of the GW events and, with it, the cross-correlation signal, particularly for shallow galaxy catalogues. In particular, current-generation facilities can achieve significant detections only for the longest time delays when cross-correlated with 2MPZ, whilst all cross-correlations with the deeper Quaia catalogue are marginally detectable or consistent with zero. Our exploratory results thus demonstrate that forecasts on cosmological or astrophysical parameters derived from GW-galaxy cross-correlations are, as expected, strongly sensitive to the assumed binary formation history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14838" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A universal critical accretion rate for black hole jet formation</a><span class="id">[2602.14838]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has long been suspected that black hole accretion-outflow coupling is invariant from the stellar to supermassive scales. Stellar mass black hole accretion flows are known to launch jets and outflows as they transition through critical accretion rate thresholds, with values well constrained observationally owing to their short evolutionary timescales. In contrast, accretion flows in typical supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems (those in active galactic nuclei) evolve over thousands of years, making the critical transitions at which jets are launched impossible to constrain in individual systems. Tidal disruption events (TDEs) provide the unique opportunity to witness the birth and evolution of an accretion flow onto a SMBH which evolves on timescales of years. Here we show that TDEs launch outflows during a super-Eddington accretion phase and a second, physically distinct outflow, at a critical accretion rate of $L_{\rm crit} \approx0.02$ $L_{\rm Edd}$, the same as the critical accretion rate for state transitions observed in accreting stellar mass black holes. This work naturally explains the mechanism, observed properties, and detection rate for prompt and delayed outflows observed in TDEs, which until now have been open problems. More broadly, we demonstrate that SMBHs exhibit the same accretion-outflow coupling as stellar mass black holes and that the critical low accretion rate threshold for jet formation in black holes is scale invariant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Statistical Validation and Vetting of Exoplanet Candidate TOI 7475.01</a><span class="id">[2602.14840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive validation analysis of the exoplanet candidate TOI 7475.01 (TIC 376866659), detected by the TESS mission.

We explore the surface magnetic field of the neutron star in this source using different models, and find that the inferred magnetic field lies in the range of about $0.3-2 \times 10^{14}$G. We study the long-term magnetic field and spin period evolution of the pulsar assuming steady accretion using prevalent theoretical mechanisms and find that the pulsar will evolve to become a millisecond pulsar having decayed magnetic field of about $\sim 10^{9}$G in about a million years. The scenario of the formation of a millisecond pulsar is also probed using an estimate of the super-Eddington duty cycle of about 14% from the literature, which suggests that the neutron star would accrete sufficient matter to become a recycled millisecond pulsar. Exploring the magnetic field as well as the spin period evolution properties of ULXPs may enable us to understand the poorly understood evolutionary features of ULXPs, shed light on one of the pathways of millisecond pulsar formation and also help us to understand transient super-Eddington accretion phases in newborn magnetars, which are believed to power energetic events such as long gamma-ray bursts and Type I superluminous supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First detection of the TiO i1Pi-a1Delta system in stellar spectra and its laboratory characterization</a><span class="id">[2602.14895]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TiO plays an important role in determining the atmospheric structure of M-type stars and in shaping the visual part of their spectra.

While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range $1\times10^{-12}$-$7\times10^{-12}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere ($v_{\mathrm{trop}}\lesssim 1.5\times10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per $\mu$m. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH$_3$-C$_2$H$_2$ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved frequency hierarchy treatment for anisotropic spectral distortions</a><span class="id">[2602.14963]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectral distortion anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provide a new probe of the early Universe that can be accessed using traditional CMB imaging techniques. It is possible to compute the creation and evolution of anisotropic signals for various scenarios using the frequency hierarchy method recently developed for CosmoTherm. However, the current treatment is not perfect and some approximations had to be made. Here, we carefully construct a modified form for the evolution equations that has the full equilibrium solutions built into the formulation. We improve the formalism to account for i) additional stimulated scattering effects, ii) kinematic corrections to the thermalization terms, iii) corrections to the standard perturbation variables and iv) direct photon sources. These effect could not be captured with the original formulation of the frequency hierarchy method but are indeed important for cleanly separating real distortions from temperature signals. However, we show that previous results are not altered significantly when compared to the improved formulation presented here. As a new worked example, which could indeed not be treated before, we also illustrate how possible changes in the temperature-redshift relation would create spectral distortion anisotropies in the pre-recombination era. The theoretical methods presented here are also an important step towards being able to consistently predict the CMB spectral distortion anisotropies in photon-dark photon and photon-axion conversion scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The radial velocity curve for HeII emission cannot be used for component mass determination in SS433</a><span class="id">[2602.14978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>More than 150 measurements of the HeII 4686A emission line in spectra of SS433 were obtained during 388 nights in 2020-2025 with the Transient Double-beam Spectrograph on the 2.5 m telescope of Caucasian Mountain Observatory of Sternberg Astronomical Institute.

We study GW production from a FOPT ending a kination-dominated epoch in the Kination-Induced Big Bang scenario, in which a period of kination domination terminates through a phase transition that reheats the universe into radiation domination. A rolling scalar field drives the kination epoch. In the specific model we consider, its derivative coupling to a second scalar (tunneling field) dynamically traps the latter in a false vacuum, with the phase transition triggered as the kination field slows due to Hubble friction. We compute the resulting stochastic GW background from bubble nucleation and collisions, presenting analytic estimates and numerical results for the peak amplitude and frequency. In all cases we find an upper bound $\Omega_{\rm GW} h^2\lesssim 2\times10^{-7}$ from the bubble percolation condition. In the case where the false vacuum energy dominates at the transition (yet the kination field drives the FOPT), we find $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\gtrsim 10^{-12}$. We further find that the Hubble scale during the phase transition across a broad set of model parameters is bounded by $\mathscr{O}(10^{-13})M^2/M_{\rm Pl}\lesssim H_* \lesssim \mathscr{O}(0.1)M^2/M_{\rm Pl}$, where $M$ is the mass-scale controlling the strength of the interaction between the kination and tunneling fields. The predicted signal spans frequencies from nHz to MHz, allowing the model to explain the signal reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments and to be constrained or probed by interferometers such as LISA, Advanced LIGO, Cosmic Explorer, and BBO. Interestingly, a FOPT can occur even if the bare tunneling potential has a single minimum, as metastability is generated dynamically by the coupling between the tunneling and the kination field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling isolated magnetar spin-down evolution and implications for long-period radio transients</a><span class="id">[2602.15024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of radio sources characterized by long spin periods ($P_{\text{spin}}&gt;10^3$ s) and highly variable radio emission.

In this paper, we present an extensive parametric analysis of isolated magnetar spin evolution using various propeller spin-down models. In general, at higher initial magnetar B-fields ($B_0&gt;\sim10^{15}$ G) and larger ambient densities ($n_0&gt;\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$), magnetars will transition to the propeller phase earlier, and they start accreting gas from the ISM or molecular clouds after $\tau\sim10^8$ yrs. We found that a transition from the pulsar to the propeller phase is required to reach the observed LPT period range of $P&gt;10^3$ s. More specifically, our population synthesis study based on Monte-Carlo simulations shows that two propeller models can account for most of the observed LPT periods ($P\sim1-400$ [min]) and their period derivative constraints ($\dot{P}&lt;10^{-9}$ s s$^{-1}$).

We find that thermal freeze-in can compensate for the underabundance of PBH-sourced DM, while indirect detection remains largely insensitive due to the feeble interaction strength, making future GW observatories such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope (ET) unique probes of this scenario. For freeze-out DM, indirect detection experiments constrain regions with relatively large annihilation cross-sections, whereas GW observations probe complementary regions with heavier DM masses and smaller interaction strengths. Consequently, the same DM parameter space cannot be simultaneously probed by both indirect detection searches and GW missions.

However, this canonical signature relies on the idealization of a continuum of sources without interference. In realistic astrophysical scenarios dominated by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), interference between discrete sources induces intrinsic deviations in the spatial correlation, which may mimic or obscure signatures of modified gravity. In this work, we derive the closed-form spatial correlation functions for a GWB with arbitrary polarization and generic GW dispersion relations, in the presence of source interference. Through a rigorous harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that source interference modifies the correlation shape but strictly preserves the lowest non-vanishing multipole moment characteristic of each polarization, specifically the quadrupole for tensor, dipole for vector, and monopole for scalar modes. The truncation at higher-order multipoles is governed by the interplay between pulsar distances and dispersion effects. Furthermore, we quantify the statistical degeneracy between interference-induced variation and modified gravity signatures. We conclude that access to only a single realization of the Universe imposes a fundamental theoretical limit on distinguishing modified gravity from GR using spatial correlations alone.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quarkyonic matter and hadron-quark crossover from an ultracold atom perspective</a><span class="id">[2602.14113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dense matter equation of state is of great interest due to the recent development of astrophysical observations for neutron stars. A rapid increase in pressure indicates a continuous crossover from a hadron phase to a quark phase without any phase transitions, yet its microscopic mechanism remains elusive. Recently, a peak in the speed of sound and a baryon momentum-shell structure, which are predicted from a quarkyonic matter picture, have been regarded as key features of the hadron-quark crossover. In this work, we explore a field-theoretical framework to describe the hadron-quark crossover, drawing an analogy with the Bose-Einstein condensate to Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BEC-BCS) crossover established in ultracold atomic experiments. Strikingly, a peak in the speed of sound and the baryon momentum-shell structure can simultaneously be explained by the tripling fluctuation effect arising from a different context of quantum many-body physics. We demonstrate these properties in a simplified model and provide a microscopic derivation of the quarkyonic matter model within our field-theoretical framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Cuspy Structure of Rotating Wormhole Shadows</a><span class="id">[2602.14182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the shadow cast by a rotating traversable wormhole in the Teo class endowed with a general redshift function, with particular emphasis on the emergence of cuspy structures. The shadow boundary is the common envelope of two critical orbit families: unstable circular orbits outside the throat and orbits at the throat itself. The formation of cusps, marking the transition between smooth and cuspy shadow boundaries, only becomes possible when the redshift parameter $\lambda$ is allowed to vary. Moreover, we uncover a universal critical value $\lambda_c$ that signals the onset of the cusp. A phase diagram characterized by the spin and redshift parameters reveals four distinct morphologies: smooth, cuspy, ears touching, and throat drowning. The morphology of the wormhole shadow may provide observational diagnostics for the different compact objects in future high-resolution imaging observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The initial states of high frequency gravitons</a><span class="id">[2602.14235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>After distinguishing the role of classical and quantum inhomogeneities in cosmological backgrounds, we constrain the initial states of the relic gravitons as soon as the different wavelengths of the spectrum cross the comoving Hubble radius, without any reference to earlier timescales.

An initial state different from the vacuum turns out to be marginally permitted in the low frequency range (associated with the largest observable wavelengths that crossed the comoving Hubble radius) while the intermediate and high frequency domains of the spectrum are populated by the gravitons produced from the vacuum.

This effect provides a simple interpretation for the acceleration interpolation relation required to modify the kinematics of a test particle in the Modified Inertial interpretation of Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). This effect can be regarded as a generalization of the thermal blackbody spectrum generated by the Unruh effect (which arises from long-time uniform acceleration in a flat background) to the scenario of local short-time non-uniform acceleration. This effect offers a unified framework for understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and the anomalies in galactic rotation curves or radial acceleration. It is worth emphasizing that this modified kinematic interpretation of MOND necessitates a quantum equivalence principle as its physical foundation, that is, extending the equivalence at the level of expectation values (first-order moments) in the classical equivalence principle to the equivalence at the level of second-order moment quantum fluctuations. Therefore, the role of this effect within the frameworks of quantum reference frames and quantum gravity is also discussed to some extent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerating Posterior Inference from Pulsar Light Curves via Learned Latent Representations and Local Simulator-Guided Optimization</a><span class="id">[2602.14520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Posterior inference from pulsar observations in the form of light curves is commonly performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which are accurate but computationally expensive. We introduce a framework that accelerates posterior inference while maintaining accuracy by combining learned latent representations with local simulator-guided optimization. A masked U-Net is first pretrained to reconstruct complete light curves from partial observations and to produce informative latent embeddings. Given a query light curve, we identify similar simulated light curves from the simulation bank by measuring similarity in the learned embedding space produced by pretrained U-Net encoder, yielding an initial empirical approximation to the posterior over parameters. This initialization is then refined using a local optimization procedure using hill-climbing updates, guided by a forward simulator, progressively shifting the empirical posterior toward higher-likelihood parameter regions. Experiments on the observed light curve of PSR J0030+0451, captured by NASA's Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), show that our method closely matches posterior estimates obtained using traditional MCMC methods while achieving 120 times reduction in inference time (from 24 hours to 12 minutes), demonstrating the effectiveness of learned representations and simulator-guided optimization for accelerated posterior inference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the impact of quasi-universal relations on neutron star constraints in third-generation detectors</a><span class="id">[2602.14659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron star systems can shed light on the currently unknown dense matter equation of state. The equation of state determines a large number of neutron star properties, such as tidal deformability, radius, and quadrupole moment, several of which directly affect the emitted gravitational-wave signals. To reduce the dimensionality when computing gravitational-waves and when interpreting observational data, quasi-universal relations are commonly employed to connect different neutron star properties. However, quasi-universal relations are not exact and their use may introduce uncertainty and bias. We explore the potential biases arising from different quasi-universal relations in the third generation era: (i) the Love-Q relation connecting the spin-induced quadrupole moment and the tidal deformability, (ii) the relation between the fundamental mode frequency and the tidal deformability, and (iii) the binary Love relation. We find that for the quadrupole relation biases are only present for rapidly rotating systems, for the binary-Love relation induces moderate biases only in the next-to-leading-order tidal parameters, which can however propagate into the inferred equation of state at low masses. Regarding fundamental mode frequencies, we find that the employed relation introduces only negligible biases, while waveform systematic effects can become comparatively large. Our results highlight that while quasi-universal relations remain a useful tool within gravitational-wave analyses, careful treatment is needed to avoid biases in equation of state measurements with next-generation detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14866" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gauge-independent gravitational waves from a minimal dark $U(1)$ sector with viable dark matter candidates</a><span class="id">[2602.14866]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Searches for stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds from first-order phase transitions offer a powerful probe of hidden sectors, but quantitative predictions in gauge theories are obstructed by the gauge dependence of the finite-temperature effective potential and the associated tunneling action.

Using the Nielsen identity together with a controlled derivative expansion and power counting, we construct a gauge-independent effective action in the high- and low-temperature limits, enabling model-intrinsic nucleation dynamics and robust gravitational wave predictions. We perform dedicated Monte Carlo scans in both limits and map viable microscopic parameters to detector-facing peak frequencies and amplitudes, spanning bands relevant to pulsar timing arrays and planned space-based interferometers. In our scans, supercooled transitions typically produce the strongest signals, whereas parametrically high-temperature transitions are comparatively rare and tend to be weak. We further connect the phase transition phenomenology to viable dark matter candidates within the same minimal field content, providing benchmark targets for dark photon dark matter and dark fermion dark matter, and highlighting their complementarity with gravitational wave observables.

In the XG era, hundreds of multimessenger detections of afterglows per year may be possible with a range of instruments, such as NewAthena in the X-ray and ngVLA in the radio.

For the present analysis we use \texttt{SEVEM} cleaned CMB maps from \emph{Planck}'s 2020 final data release (public release 4/PR4). To probe HPA, we employed the local variance estimator (LVE) method with different disc radii ranging from $0.5^\circ$ to $90^\circ$. Our emphasis here is to revalidate the LVE method in various ways for its optimal usage and probe the hemispherical power asymmetry in the form of a dipole modulation field underlying CMB sky. By and large, our results are in agreement with earlier reported ones with more detailed presentation of explicit and not-so-explicit assumptions involved in the estimation process. It is reaffirmed that HPA is confined to low multipoles or large angular scales of the CMB sky. A dipole like anisotropy was found in the LVE maps with anomalous power for disc radii of $2^\circ$ and upward up to $36^\circ$ at $\gtrsim2\sigma$ level. In the range $4^\circ$ to $10^\circ$ none of the 600 \sevem\ CMB simulations were found to have a dipole amplitude higher than the data when using LVE method as originally proposed. The above reported values fall in the reliability range of LVE method after this extensive re-evaluation. We also observe a scale dependence of the HPA dipole amplitude and model it as a power-law. We conclude that the hemispherical power asymmetry still remains as a challenge to the standard model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16054" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compression fronts from fast radio bursts</a><span class="id">[2503.16054]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When a fast radio burst (FRB) expands from its source through a surrounding tenuous plasma, it strongly heats and compresses the plasma at radii up to $\sim 10^{14}$cm. The likely central engines of FRBs are magnetars, and their ambient plasma at radii $r\gg 10^{10}$cm is a magnetized $e^\pm$ wind. We formulate basic equations of the FRB-plasma interaction, solve them numerically, and describe the physical picture of the interaction. We find the following: (1) FRBs emitted at $r&lt;r_{\rm stoch}\sim 10^{12}$cm induce fast stochastic heating and strong compression of the wind, sweeping it like a broom. The outcome of this interaction is determined by the energy losses of the radio wave; we evaluate the parameter space where FRBs survive and escape. (2) At radii $r&gt;r_{\rm stoch}$, FRB induces regular particle oscillations in the radio wave with the standard strength parameter $a$, and drives a compression wave in the wind. At $r&gt;r_\star\sim 10^{13}$cm, the compression wave becomes locally quasisteady, with compression factor $1+a^2$. FRBs avoid damping if they are released into the wind medium outside $r_{\rm damp}\sim 10^{11}$cm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Free Cosmic Density Bispectrum on Small Scales</a><span class="id">[2504.17386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the asymptotic behaviour of the free, cold-dark matter density fluctuation bispectrum in the limit of small scales. From an initially Gaussian random field, we draw phase-space positions of test particles which then propagate along Zel'dovich trajectories. Only initial momentum-momentum correlation are considered, making the formulas identical to the typical Zel'dovich approximation. A suitable expansion of the initial momentum auto-correlations of these particles leads to an asymptotic series whose lower-order power-law exponents we calculate. The dominant contribution has an exponent of $-11/2$. For triangle configurations with zero surface area, this exponent is even enhanced to $-9/2$. These power laws can only be revealed by a non-perturbative calculation with respect to the initial power spectrum. They are valid for a general class of initial power spectra with a cut-off function, required to enforce convergence of its moments. We then confirm our analytic results numerically. Finally, we use this asymptotic behaviour to investigate the shape dependence of the bispectrum in the small-scale limit, and to show how different shapes grow over cosmic time. These confirm the usual model of gravitational collapse within the Zel'dovich picture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma-Ray Millisecond Pulsars: Off-pulse Emission Characteristics, Phase-Resolved Pseudo-Luminosity–Cutoff Energy Correlation, and High-energy Pulsed Emission</a><span class="id">[2505.01708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the $\gamma$-ray emission from 38 millisecond pulsars using 15 years of Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data in the 0.3–500 GeV range. Off-pulse intervals defined objectively with the Bayesian Blocks algorithm reveal significant off-pulse emission from 15 sources. Ten exhibit clear spectral cutoffs indicative of magnetospheric origin, while the remaining five show no compelling evidence for non-magnetospheric origins, as their off-pulse emission is spatially unresolved and inconsistent with hadronic, inverse Compton, or intrabinary contributions, implying a likely magnetospheric origin. We perform phase-resolved spectral fits for these 15 sources. In 11 of them, the cutoff energy $E_{\rm cut}$ varies markedly with rotation phase and correlates positively with the phase-resolved photon counts. Defining a phase-resolved pseudo-luminosity, these 11 pulsars follow a linear relation between $\log_{10}L$ and $\log_{10}E_{\rm cut}$, with slope $\alpha = 2.31^{+0.22}_{-0.25}$, consistent with curvature-radiation predictions from the equatorial current sheet ($\alpha \approx 2.29$). The same relation appears in the bright pulsar J0614$-$3329, implying the same emission mechanism across all rotational phases. We detect pulsed emission above 10 GeV from 19 sources, and a significant fraction of these also exhibit robust off-pulse emission. The coexistence of robust off-pulse flux and pulsed emission extending to high energies challenges standard outer-gap models. While other frameworks can also produce off-pulse flux, the phase-resolved $L$–$E_{\rm cut}$ correlation could provide a key diagnostic, and our measured slope may provide new evidence supporting the equatorial current sheet scenario as an important $\gamma$-ray emission mechanism in millisecond pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Superfluid Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2505.23900]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales.

We present a 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulation of jet launching in YSOs, focusing on the interaction between the stellar magnetosphere and the accretion disk. In our model, a fast, low-density bipolar jet is powered by disk-magnetosphere interaction and launched through the polar cavity that is mass-loaded from the disk rather than the star. Specifically, outflows are driven by toroidal magnetic pressure generated along &quot;two-legged&quot; field lines, anchored at a magnetically dominated stellar footpoint and a mass-dominated point on the (magnetically elevated) disk surface via a cyclic &quot;load-fire-reload&quot; process: in the &quot;load&quot; stage, differential rotation between stellar and disk footpoints generates toroidal magnetic pressure; in the &quot;fire&quot; stage, vertical gradients in the toroidal field accelerate plasma and transport Poynting flux into the polar cavity; in the &quot;reload&quot; stage, magnetic reconnection allows the cycle to repeat, reforming &quot;two-legged&quot; field lines. These field lines are not required to be fully reset to a dipolar loop configuration; it is only required that the disk-end be shallowly embedded in the (elevated) disk surface. This rapid, asynchronous process produces a continuous, large-scale outflow. The resulting magnetically dominated (Poynting) jet, accelerated by magnetic pressure within the low-density polar cavity, is distinct from the denser, slower disk wind launched through the classic magnetic-tower mechanism. Comparison with a disk-only model shows that the rotating stellar magnetosphere promotes bipolar jet launching by shaping a magnetic geometry favorable to symmetric outflows.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The spin-orbit alignment hypothesis in millisecond pulsars</a><span class="id">[2507.13893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are spun up during their accretion phase in a binary system.

Our goal is to constrain the observer viewing angle $\zeta$ and to check whether it agrees with the orbital inclination angle $i$, in other words if $\zeta \approx i$. We use a Bayesian inference technique to fit the MSP $\gamma$-ray light curves based on the third $\gamma$-ray pulsar catalogue (3PC). The emission model relies on the striped wind model deduced from force-free neutron star magnetosphere simulations. We found good agreement between the two angles $i$ and $\zeta$ for a significant fraction of our sample, about four fifth, confirming the spin-orbit alignment scenario during the accretion stage. However about one fifth of our sample deviates significantly from this alignment.

Previous works studying the threshold mass for prompt collapse to a black hole have primarily focused on the uncertainties in the zero-temperature EoS, which are parametrized by a macroscopic quantity such as the characteristic neutron star radius. However, prompt collapse can take place either with or without a core bounce during the merger. In the bounce-collapse scenario, shocks can produce additional thermal support, potentially altering the threshold for collapse. In this work, we investigate the impact of the uncertainties in the finite-temperature part of the nuclear EoS on the threshold mass for prompt collapse in equal mass mergers. Using two cold EoSs, combined with four parametrizations of the finite-temperature part of the EoS, we find that the threshold mass is insensitive to realistic variations of the thermal prescription, at sub-percent accuracy. We report on the thermal properties and ejecta of mergers with masses just above the threshold mass, i.e., which experience a single core-bounce before collapsing. During the bounce, the thermal pressure can reach )(1-10)% of the cold pressure at supranuclear densities, depending on the thermal treatment, leading to modest differences in the dynamical ejecta that are launched and in the remnant disk mass as a result.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hypothesis of a bi-isotropic-like plasma permeating the interstellar space</a><span class="id">[2508.15879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we study the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized chiral plasma that pervades the interstellar space.

It is expected that observations of large-scale structures (LSSs) would also exhibit a related kinematic dipole. However, numerous studies of the LSS dipole have shown significant discrepancies with predictions based on the CMB. In this work, we investigate how considering the clustering dipole affects the LSSs distribution dipole using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array (VLA) Sky Survey (NVSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and examine the nonlinear regime to calculate the correlation between the clustering and the kinematic dipole. Our results show up to $\lesssim28\%$ enhancement in the clustering dipole amplitude compared to previous studies, with increases of up to $\lesssim 22\%$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $\lesssim 28\%$ in modified gravity scenarios. Additionally, we explore a model in which the distribution of matter on LSS could be intrinsically anisotropic by a long-mode modulation. Using the remnant discrepancy between the observed and predicted dipole, we derive an upper limit for the amplitude of intrinsic dimensionless anisotropy $\lesssim 0.22$. Furthermore, we investigate these results within the framework of the $f(R)$ modified gravity model. We conclude that nonlinear clustering and local structure correlations partially alleviate the dipole tension within $\Lambda$CDM, yet, this anomaly remains a challenge. Two alternative models are in the direction of relaxing the tension. However, further investigation and more accurate data are needed to support a stronger argument.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05976" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reassessing the Spin of Second-born Black Holes in Coalescing Binary Black Holes and Its Connection to the chi_eff-q Correlation</a><span class="id">[2509.05976]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mass ratio q and effective inspiral spin chi_eff of binary black hole (BBH) mergers in GWTC-4.0 show a weaker anti-correlation than in GWTC-3.0, motivating investigation of its physical origin. Within the isolated binary evolution framework, we adopt a recently proposed He-star wind prescription to study the spin of the second-born BH and its impact on the q-chi_eff relation. Using \texttt{MESA}, including the updated He-star wind, internal differential rotation, and tidal interactions, we examine how initial conditions and key processes determine the BH spin. We also perform rapid population synthesis with \texttt{COMPAS} to predict the population-level q-chi_eff correlation. The updated wind prescription is significantly weaker than the standard Dutch scheme, particularly at subsolar metallicity. Detailed binary models of He stars with BH companions show that the resulting BH spin is largely insensitive to the He star's evolutionary stage at the onset of tidal interaction and to the companion mass. Instead, wind mass loss dominates: more massive He-star progenitors produce lower-spinning BHs. Initial stellar rotation has only a minor effect, especially under strong tidal coupling. We provide a fitting formula for the spin of the second-born BH. Combining this formula with rapid population synthesis under default assumptions, we find that 85.8% of BBHs formed via stable mass transfer undergo mass-ratio reversal, compared to only 2.8% in the common-envelope channel. Notably, no correlation between q and chi_eff is found in either channel. Future work will explore alternative physical prescriptions and compare our predictions with BBH mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12808" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two unseen massive white dwarf candidates in close binaries</a><span class="id">[2509.12808]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of two binary systems, each consisting of a slightly bloated G-type main-sequence star and an unseen companion, identified through photometric data from TESS and radial velocity variation from Gaia. High-resolution spectroscopy confirms orbital periods of 1.37 and 2 .67 d with circular orbits. The visible components have masses of $\sim$0.9–1.0$\,M_\odot$, while the minimum masses of the unseen companions are $1.078^{+0.058}_{-0.060}\, M_\odot$ and $0.943^{+0.048}_{-0.049}\, M_\odot$, respectively. Assuming tidal synchronization, we estimate the companion masses to be $1.13^{+0.11}_{-0.08} M_\odot$ and $1.05^{+0.15}_{-0.10} M_\odot$. The absence of detectable spectral features from the companions rules out main-sequence stars of these masses, suggesting that the unseen companions are likely O/Ne or C/O massive white dwarfs. The short orbital periods imply that these systems are post-common envelope binaries. Their subsequent evolution is uncertain, with possible outcomes including cataclysmic variables, Type Ia supernovae, or accretion-induced collapse, depending on the nature of future mass transfer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIPLODOCUS II: Implementation of transport equations and test cases relevant to micro-scale physics of jetted astrophysical sources</a><span class="id">[2510.12505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a framework being developed for the mesoscopic modelling of astrophysical systems via the transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including continuous forces and discrete interactions between particles.

Previous studies have forecasted stringent constraints on energy injections from exotic sources that heat, excite, and ionize the background gas and thereby modify the 21-cm signal. In this work, we quantify the substantial impact that astrophysical uncertainties have on the projected sensitivity to exotic energy injection. In particular, there are significant uncertainties in the minimum star-forming dark matter halo mass, the Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, and the X-ray emission, whose values characterize the fiducial astrophysical model when projecting bounds. As a case study, we investigate the energy injection of accreting primordial black holes of mass $\sim 1~M_\odot-10^3~M_\odot$, also taking into account uncertainties in the accretion model. We show that, depending on the chosen fiducial model and accretion uncertainties, the sensitivity of future 21-cm data could constrain the abundance of primordial black holes to be either slightly stronger, or significantly weaker, than current limits from the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Pressure Anisotropy via Universal Relations</a><span class="id">[2510.26042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars may exhibit pressure anisotropy arising from various physical mechanisms, such as elasticity, magnetic fields, viscosity, and superfluidity. We compute the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode oscillation frequency of anisotropic neutron stars using a phenomenological quasi-local model characterized by a single dimensionless anisotropy parameter. We find that while the relation between the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode frequency depends on the degree of anisotropy, it remains largely insensitive to variations in the equation of state (the relation between radial pressure and energy density) for a fixed anisotropy parameter, similar to the isotropic case. Leveraging this anisotropy-dependent universal relation within a statistical framework, we place constraints on the anisotropy parameter using both the gravitational wave observation of GW170817 and simulated data for a GW170817-like event observed by a future network of detectors. We find that the anisotropy parameter can be constrained to order unity with current data, and the bounds remain comparable with future detector sensitivities. Importantly, these constraints are only weakly affected by uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Conservation laws in non-inertial frames and non-conservation of energy of relative motion in two-body problem</a><span class="id">[2511.08709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of systems of multiple gravitationally interacting bodies is often studied in a frame attached to one of the objects (e.g. a central star in a planetary system). As this frame is generally non-inertial, indirect forces appear in the equations describing the motion of bodies relative to the reference object. According to the convention adopted in celestial mechanics, the associated indirect acceleration is defined to be different for every object under consideration, whereas the gravitational coupling between each body and the reference object is described via the effective two-body potential, which does not obey the equivalence principle. Here we point out that a slightly different and more physically motivated definition of the indirect acceleration provides significant benefits when interpreting relative motion in a non-inertial frame. First, the indirect acceleration ends up being the same for all objects in the system. Second, the non-conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy of the whole system in a non-inertial frame naturally follow from the action of the indirect acceleration on the system as an external force. We also argue that the vis viva integral of the classical two-body problem should not be interpreted as a statement of energy conservation in a non-inertial frame attached to one of the bodies. The energy of relative motion is not conserved in this frame due to the work done on the two-body system by the indirect force. These results can be useful for interpreting dynamics in various astrophysical contexts, in particular the physics of disc-planet coupling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DESI DR1 peculiar velocity survey: growth rate measurements from the galaxy power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2512.03231]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution encapsulate a wealth of cosmological information. A powerful means of unlocking this knowledge lies in measuring the auto-power spectrum and/or the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields, followed by the estimation of cosmological parameters based on these spectrum measurements. In this study, we generalize the cross-power spectrum model to accommodate scenarios where the density and momentum fields are derived from distinct galaxy surveys. The growth rate of the large-scale structures of the Universe, commonly represented as $f\sigma_8$, is extracted by jointly fitting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the auto-density power spectrum, the monopole of the auto-momentum power spectrum, and the dipole of the cross-power spectrum. Our estimators, theoretical models and parameter-fitting framework have been tested using mocks, confirming their robustness and accuracy in retrieving the fiducial growth rate from simulation. These techniques are then applied to analyze the power spectrum of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey and Peculiar Velocity Survey, and the fit result of the growth rate is $f\sigma_8=0.440^{+0.080}_{-0.096}$ at effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.07$. By synthesizing the fitting outcomes from correlation functions, maximum likelihood estimation and power spectrum, yields a consensus value of $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}=0.07) = 0.450 ^{+0.055}_{-0.055}$, and correspondingly we obtain $\gamma=0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.301^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ and $\sigma_8=0.834^{+0.032}_{-0.032}$.

Quantifying how frequently such nesting occurs is important for understanding the organisation and recurrence of solar magnetic fields. We introduce an automated approach based on kernel density estimation and DBSCAN clustering to identify nests in the longitude-time domain and to measure the fraction of sunspot groups that belong to them. The method combines a smooth representation of emergence patterns with a density-based clustering procedure, validated using synthetic solar-like cycles and corrected for variations in data density. We apply this method to 151 years of sunspot-group observations from the Royal Greenwich Observatory Photoheliographic Results (RGO, 1874-1976) and Kislovodsk Mountain Astronomical Station (KMAS, 1955-2025) catalogues. Across all cycles and latitude bands, the mean nesting degree is $\langle D\rangle = 0.61 \pm 0.12$, implying that about 60 percent all sunspot groups emerge within nests. Nesting is strongest at mid-latitudes (10$^\circ$-20$^\circ$), and results from the two independent datasets agree in the period of overlap. The nesting degree significantly correlates with the solar activity level, with the correlation strengthening when small groups are excluded. The characteristic inter-nest spacing contracts from $\sim$200-500 Mm at low activity to $\sim$60-100 Mm at solar maximum, approaching typical sunspot-group dimensions. The identified nests range from compact clusters to long-lived, drifting structures, offering new quantitative constraints on the persistence and organisation of solar magnetic activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cygnus X-3 as a PeVatron and the LHAASO 2025 data</a><span class="id">[2512.18786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have recently argued that the high-mass X-ray binary Cygnus X-3 can accelerate cosmic rays (CR) beyond PeV energies.

The latter channel leads naturally to a contribution to the photon flux peaking around PeV energies which is orbitally modulated.

To achieve these purposes, the global maps of escape trajectories are constructed, and escape trajectories with one lunar gravity assist are pre-filtered. Then, an effective method to identification escape families is proposed based on dynamical analysis and data mining techniques. Once the escape families are identified, the corresponding characteristics are analyzed to provide insights into the construction of escape trajectories. Based on these escape families, the effects of the solar gravity perturbation on the number of escape trajectories, the emergence and disappearance of escape families, variation in generalized energy, and transfer characteristics are further summarized, providing insights into the model selection in the escape trajectory construction.

Through a comprehensive likelihood analysis, we derive best-fit values and 68\% confidence intervals for key cosmological parameters, finding $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.322^{+0.027}_{-0.030}$ and $\sigma_8 = 0.735^{+0.045}_{-0.035}$ for $\Lambda$CDM, with deviations in alternative models consistent within $1\sigma$. For the thawing model, we consider an exponential potential with slope $\lambda = 0.736^{+0.270}_{-0.227}$, while for the tracker and scaling-freezing models, we use inverse axion-like and double exponential potentials, respectively. Observationally, the tracker model yields $n = 5.651^{+1.625}_{-1.604}$ and $f = 0.258^{+0.149}_{-0.096}$, and the scaling-freezing model gives $\lambda_1 = 0.405^{+0.293}_{-0.322}$ and $\lambda_2 = 23.226^{+7.975}_{-7.258}$. The dimensionless tSZ amplitude ($\widetilde{W}^{\rm SZ}$) and cosmic infrared background (CIB) parameters are tightly constrained across all models, providing additional insights into astrophysical foregrounds. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISW–tSZ cross-correlations as a probe of dark energy dynamics, with the Thawing quintessence model yielding the lowest $\chi^2_{\rm min}$ among the tested scenarios, and highlight the need for future high-precision measurements to distinguish between quintessence models and $\Lambda$CDM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Black Hole Parameters from Shadow and Inner-Shadow Morphology Considering Effects from Thick Disk Accretion Flows</a><span class="id">[2601.21995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the effects of emission geometry on the capability to constrain black hole parameters from measurements of the shadow and inner-shadow of a Reissner-Nordström black hole.

High-precision ESPRESSO radial velocities allowed us to constrain the planetary masses and investigate their potential compositions. The TOI-4336 A system is composed of a sub-Neptune with a period of 16.34 days, a radius of $2.14 \pm 0.08$ Re, and a mass of $3.33 \pm 0.36$ Me, along with an inner super-Earth on a 7.59-day orbit with a radius of $1.25 \pm 0.07$ Re and a mass of $1.55 \pm 0.13$ Me.

[ arXiv:2310.12859 ] claimed strong evidence for the statistical anisotropy of the universe. The claim is based on a joint analysis of four different anomaly tests of the cosmic microwave background data, each of which is known to be anomalous, with a lower level of significance. They reported a combined $p$-value of about $3\times 10^{-8}$, which is more than a $5\sigma$ level of significance. We observe that statistical anisotropy is not even relevant for two of the four considered tests, which seems sufficient to invalidate the authors' claim. Furthermore, even if one reinterprets the claim as evidence against $\Lambda$CDM rather than statistical anisotropy, we argue that this result significantly suffers from the look-elsewhere effect. Assuming a set of independent (i.e., uncorrelated) tests, we show that if the four tests with the smallest $p$-values are cherry-picked from 10 independent tests, the $p$-value reported by Jones et al. corresponds to only $3\sigma$ significance. If there are 27 independent tests, the significance falls to $2\sigma$. These numbers, however, overstate our argument, since the four tests used by Jones et al. are slightly correlated. Determining the correlation of Jones et al.'s tests by comparing their joint $p$-value with the product of the four separate $p$-values, we find that about 16 or 50 tests are sufficient to reduce the significance of Jones et al.'s results to 3$\sigma$ or 2$\sigma$ significance, respectively. We also provide a list of anomaly tests discussed in the literature (and propose a few generalizations), suggesting that very plausibly 16 (or even 50) independent tests have been published, and possibly many more have been considered but not published. We conclude that the current data is consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM model and, in particular, with statistical isotropy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fate of false vacuum in non-perturbative regimes: Gravity effects</a><span class="id">[2206.09965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A recent analysis of the false-vacuum decay in non-perturbative regimes is here extended in the presence of Einstein gravity, computing the corresponding effective potential and decay rate.

By using modified expansion normalized variables that account for negative values of the scalar field potential, we derive cosmological dynamical system equations and expressions for physical variables. Five specific scalar field models (axions/ALPs, cyclic ekpyrotic, exponential with a constant, quintessence, and SFDM) are examined in depth to determine how they evolve, as they are thought to represent evolving dark energy in the late Universe. Using appropriate mathematical methods (e.g. linear stability, center manifold and Poincaré sphere), we present critical points along with their character and physical interpretation with respect to the possible evolution of the Universe. Considering both positive and negative values of the coupling parameter allows us to examine the transfer of energy from the scalar sector to dust and from matter to the scalar field. Considering four different values of this parameter provides a comprehensive analysis that incorporates all significant types of dynamical system evolution (from mathematical and physical perspectives). The initial conditions for the in-depth numerical analysis were calculated analytically from Planck 2018 and DESI DR2 CPL parametrizations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About electroweak domain walls in Majoron models</a><span class="id">[2506.02910]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Some time ago it was claimed in &quot;Spontaneous Breaking of Lepton Number and Cosmological Domain Wall Problem&quot; (Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 151301 (2019)) that non perturbative instantons of the weak interaction $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$ lead to the formation of domain walls in Majoron models owing to the anomaly of the spontaneously broken global lepton number $L$ symmetry $\text{U}(1)_L$ with respect to $\text{SU}(2)_\text{W}$. We point out that it has long been known, that this effect can be completely rotated away unless there is a source of explicit $B+L$ breaking present, where $B$ denotes baryon number. We further estimate the tiny instanton induced Majoron mass from $B+L$ breaking and analyze the cosmological impact of such domain walls including possible finite temperature effects. In general this scenario does not lead to a cosmological catastrophe and we demonstrate that the tiny instanton induced mass can act as a bias term to collapse walls induced by a larger source of lepton number breaking. Alternatively this electroweak Majoron could act as dynamical dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maximal parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter with lepton asymmetries</a><span class="id">[2507.20659]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We delineate the maximal parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter in the presence of lepton flavor asymmetries. We focus on large flavor asymmetries with vanishing total lepton asymmetry, which are washed out by neutrino oscillations at MeV temperatures and hence are consistent with BBN and CMB constraints. We derive a semi-classical Boltzmann equation for sterile neutrinos applicable in this regime and validate it against quantum kinetic equations. For sterile neutrino masses up to 60 keV, the viable range of mixing angles extends by up to two orders of magnitude, with broad prospects for tests in forthcoming X-ray, CMB, and structure formation observations. We also release a public framework to compute the production of sterile neutrinos, and in particular their momentum distribution, enabling dedicated structure formation analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Affleck-Dine Leptoflavorgenesis</a><span class="id">[2509.08175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a scenario to produce large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with vanishing total lepton asymmetry, based on the Affleck-Dine mechanism with Q-ball formation. This scenario can produce large lepton flavor asymmetries while automatically maintaining the vanishing total lepton number without fine-tuning, evading the current BBN and the CMB constraints by neutrino oscillations at MeV temperature. The asymmetries can be produced at cosmic temperatures of $T\gtrsim 1\ {\rm GeV}$, early enough to have broad impacts from the early Universe to the present cosmology. This scenario could affect various aspects of early Universe cosmology simultaneously or separately: (i) explaining the observed baryon asymmetry by the same origin as the lepton flavor asymmetries, (ii) affecting the nature of the QCD transition, (iii) opening up a new parameter space of sterile neutrino dark matter by enhancing their production, and (iv) altering the abundance of the light elements, in particular, resolving the recently reported helium-4 anomaly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20457" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass-ratio inspirals around non-spinning black holes</a><span class="id">[2509.20457]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a relativistically accurate formalism to model the interaction between stellar mass compact objects embedded in thin accretion disks around a non-spinning supermassive black hole, using tools from self-force theory and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We then apply this formalism to analyze the evolution of a compact object on a nearly circular and equatorial orbit interacting with a thin equatorial disk. We provide analytic and relativistically-accurate expressions for the rates of energy and angular momentum exchanged during interactions due to Lindblad and corotation resonances. Our results show that relativistic corrections can enhance the magnitude of the torque by 1-2 orders of magnitude compared to purely Newtonian expressions when the orbit of the compact object is smaller than $10$ Schwarzschild radii of the supermassive black hole. We also demonstrate that strong relativistic shifts the inner Lindblad resonances closer to the compact object than the outer Lindblad resonances when the compact object is closer than 4 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole, potentially leading to a reversal in the direction of the torque acting on the compact object. Finally, we provide a dephasing estimate and show that using the relativistic torque formula is crucial to obtain reliable estimates for extreme mass ratio inspirals in orbits closer than 5 Schwarzschild radii to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of using relativistically-accurate models of environmental interactions in extreme mass-ratio inspirals close to a supermassive black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19863" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracing Inflationary Imprints Through the Dark Ages: Implications for Early Stars and Galaxies Formation</a><span class="id">[2510.19863]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore how inflationary features shape the early stages of cosmic structure formation. Using the transfer function formalism, we trace the evolution of primordial perturbations, showing how causal physics and oscillatory signatures from inflation influence the matter power spectrum. The variance of smoothed density fields is then applied to model the collapse of overdense regions and predict dark matter halo abundances through the Press-Schechter framework. Extending to the baryonic sector, we analyze primordial gas collapse in minihalos, emphasizing molecular hydrogen cooling and the thermochemical pathways leading to Population III star formation. Finally, we examine primordial black holes as potential seeds for early galaxies, connecting their accretion-driven growth to the stellar masses and disk properties of high-redshift systems. Our results indicate that oscillatory features from inflation can leave measurable imprints on halo abundances and early galaxy properties, providing a testable link between high-energy physics and astrophysical observations with JWST</p></div></details></article></body>
