Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfvén velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfvén waves. The timescales on which Alfvén waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfvén waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfvén waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of debris disks observed with SPHERE</a><span class="id">[2512.03128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study aims to characterize debris disks observed with SPHERE across multiple programs, with the goal of identifying systematic trends in disk morphology, dust mass, and grain properties as a function of stellar parameters. We analyzed a sample of 161 young stars using SPHERE observations at optical and near-IR wavelengths. Disk geometries were derived from ellipse fitting and model grids, while dust mass and properties were constrained by modified blackbody (MBB) and size distribution (SD) modeling of SEDs. The dynamical modeling was performed to assess whether the observed disk structures can be explained by the presence of unseen planets. We resolved 51 debris disks, including four new detections: HD 36968, BD-20 951, and the inner belts of HR 8799 and HD 36546. In addition, we found a second transiting giant planet in the HD 114082 system, with a radius of 1.29 $R_{\rm Jup}$ and an orbital distance of  1 au. We identified nine multi-belt systems, with outer-to-inner belt radius ratios of $1.5-2$, and found close agreement between scattered-light and millimeter-continuum belt radii. They scale weakly with stellar luminosity ($R_{\rm belt} \propto L_{\star}^{0.11}$), but show steeper dependencies when separated by CO and CO$_2$ freeze-out regimes. Disk fractional luminosities follow collisional decay trends, declining as $t_{\rm age}^{-1.18}$ for A and $t_{\rm age}^{-0.81}$ for F stars. The inferred dust masses span $10^{-5}-1\,M_\oplus$ from MBB and $0.01-1\,M_\oplus$ from SD modeling. These masses scale as $R_{\rm belt}^n$ with $n&gt;2$ in belt radius and super-linearly with stellar mass, consistent with trends seen in protoplanetary disks. Analysing correlation between disk polarized flux and IR excess, we found an offset of  1 dex between total-intensity (HST) and polarized fluxes. A new parametric approach to estimate dust albedo and maximum polarization fraction is introduced.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRB 230204B: GIT Discovery of a Fast Fading Afterglow Associated with an Energetic GRB from a Massive-Star Progenitor</a><span class="id">[2512.03136]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive multi-wavelength study of a bright gamma-ray burst GRB 230204B, analyzing both prompt and afterglow emissions. This GRB is highly energetic, with an isotropic equivalent energy emission $E_{\mathrm{iso}} \sim 2.2 \times 10^{54}\ \mathrm{erg}$, released during the prompt emission. The GROWTH-India Telescope discovered a bright afterglow ($m_r = 15.55$) that faded rapidly ($\propto t^{-1.82}$). The prompt emission shows strong thermal photospheric emission, along with a non-thermal high-energy component. We explore the evolution of these components and find them to be consistent with theoretical expectations. Afterglow modeling reveals an energetic jet $E_{tot} \gtrsim 10^{52}\ \mathrm{erg}$ expanding into a wind-type medium viewed nearly on-axis, suggesting a massive star progenitor with strong winds. We also explore correlations between the prompt emission and afterglow that may help to understand the complete picture of GRB progenitors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology after Phantom Crossing by Horndeski Gravity</a><span class="id">[2512.03139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One possible way to explain the observed effective dark energy equation of state crossing $w=-1$ (the phantom divide) is through modified gravity. A key point is to not view the expansion history in isolation but to take into account the other gravitational impacts on growth of large scale structure, lensing, etc. Within shift symmetric Horndeski gravity this implies three main paths for the late time cosmic expansion. All require unusual kinetic structure and we analyze their various implications for how $w$ should behave after phantom crossing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Wind-Driven Origin for the Firework Morphology of the Supernova Remnant Pa 30</a><span class="id">[2512.03140]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pa 30 – the likely remnant of the Galactic type Iax supernova of 1181 AD – displays an unusual, firework-like morphology, consisting of radial filaments extending from a common center, where a white dwarf (WD) currently drives a very fast wind (speed $\gtrsim 10^{4}$ km s$^{-1}$). We propose the filaments arose from the Rayleigh-Taylor-unstable nature of the interface between the circumstellar medium (CSM) and the shocked wind launched by the natal WD; the filaments then elongated intact due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz-stable nature of the large initial density contrast between the wind and CSM, supplemented by the slowly declining wind density profile (relative to homologously expanding ejecta). To support this interpretation, we present two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations and derive the filament properties, including their speed, density, and temperature, all of which are consistent with observations. We suggest the filaments elongate until the wind and CSM densities become comparable at the contact discontinuity, which occurs within 1–10 years, and then truncate because the RTI halts. The subsequent KHI growth timescale across the current width of the filaments is longer than the age of Pa 30, so they remain intact. The filament-less central region in Pa 30 is therefore more likely a consequence of the finite timescale over which the RTI operates, rather than a wind termination shock. In general, firework-like filaments may form in other systems, provided there is a sufficiently large density contrast between the ejecta and its surroundings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-angular-resolution ALMA imaging of the inhomogeneous dynamical atmosphere of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya</a><span class="id">[2512.03156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-angular-resolution imaging of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere and inner wind. W Hya was observed with the longest baselines of ALMA at 250-268 GHz with an angular resolution of  17x20 mas. ALMA's high angular resolution allowed us to resolve the stellar disk of W Hya, along with clumpy, irregularly shaped emission extending to  100 mas: plume in the north-northwest, a tail in the south-southwest, and the extended atmosphere elongated in the east-northeast–west-southwest direction, with semimajor and semiminor axes of  70 and 40 mas ( 3.4 and 1.9 Rstar), respectively. We identified 57 lines, which include SiO, H2O, SO2, SO, HCN, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2, OH, and some of their isotopologues. The molecular line images show spatially inhomogeneous molecular formation. Our ALMA data taken at phase 0.53 (minimum light) indicate global, accelerating infall within  75 mas (3.6 Rstar) but also outflow at up to  10 km/s in deeper layers. While 38 of the detected lines appear in absorption against the continuum stellar disk as expected, we detect nonthermal emission on top of the continuum over the stellar disk in 19 lines of SiO, H2O, SO2, and AlO. The emission of SiO, AlO, TiO, TiO2, SO, and SO2 coincides well with the clumpy dust cloud distribution obtained from contemporaneous visible polarimetric imaging in addition to H2O reported in our previous work. This lends support to the idea that SiO, H2O, and AlO are directly involved in grain nucleation. The overlap of SO/SO2 (possibly also TiO/TiO2) with the dust clouds suggests the formation of these molecules and dust behind shocks induced by pulsation and/or convection. We detect HCN emission close to the star, down to  30 mas ( 1.4 Rstar), which is consistent with shock-induced chemistry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Origins of the Bulk flow</a><span class="id">[2512.03168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the origin of the large scale bulk flow using the CosmicFlows 4 (CF4) peculiar velocity catalog. We decompose the observed motions into internal components, generated by mass fluctuations within 200Mpc/h, and external ones arising from structures beyond this volume. A weighted average technique is developed to test the model's self consistency while minimizing the impact of non Gaussian distance errors. The CF4 velocities show excellent agreement with the predicted internal field, yielding beta = 0.31 pm 0.01. We also determine that the value of the Hubble constant that should be used for calculating peculiar velocities from the CF4 to be H0 = 75.9 pm 0.1 km/s/ Mpc, consistent with CF4 calibrations. Using the minimum variance formalism, we further separate the bulk flow into its internal and external contributions and find that the observed large scale bulk flow is dominated by sources beyond 200Mpc/h. The amplitude of this externally driven flow increases monotonically with scale, consistent with the influence of a distant, massive overdensity. These findings reinforce the reliability of the CF4 velocity field while calling into question the assumption of a spatially uniform flow generated by external sources. Our results challenge the commonly made assumption that the flow in our local volume due to external mass concentrations can be modeled as being spatially uniform.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Field Amplification and Particle Acceleration in Weakly Magnetized Trans-relativistic Electron-ion Shocks</a><span class="id">[2512.03169]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the physics of quasi-parallel trans-relativistic shocks propagating in weakly magnetized plasmas by means of long-duration two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. The structure of the shock precursor is shaped by a competition between the Bell instability and the Weibel instability. The Bell instability is dominant at relatively high magnetizations $(\sigma\gtrsim10^{-3})$, whereas the Weibel instability prevails at lower magnetizations $(\sigma\lesssim10^{-4})$. Bell-dominated shocks efficiently accelerate ions, converting a fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim0.2$ of the upstream flow energy into downstream nonthermal ion energy. The maximum energy of nonthermal ions exhibits a Bohm scaling in time, as $E_{\max}\propto t$. A much smaller fraction $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\ll0.1$ of the upstream flow energy goes into downstream nonthermal electrons in the Bell-dominated regime. On the other hand, Weibel-dominated shocks efficiently generate both nonthermal ions and electrons with $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{i}}\sim\varepsilon_{\mathrm{e}}\sim0.1$, albeit with a slower scaling for the maximum energy, $E_{\mathrm{max}}\propto t^{1/2}$. Our results are applicable to a wide range of trans-relativistic shocks, including the termination shocks of extragalactic jets, the late stages of gamma-ray burst afterglows, and shocks in fast blue optical transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Extent of Solar Energetic Particle Irradiation in the Sun's Protoplanetary Disk</a><span class="id">[2512.03184]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares emit X rays and high-energy (MeV-GeV) ions (Solar Energetic Particles, or SEPs). Astronomical observations show solar mass-protostellar fluxes are a factor $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^2 - 3 \times 10^3$ times higher than the present-day Sun. Constraining $\Phi$ in the early solar system is important for modeling ionization in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, the extent of magnetorotational instability or magnetocentrifugal outflows, or even production of short-lived radionuclides. Recent interpretations of meteoritic data – cosmogenic Ne in hibonite grains, initial $({}^{10}{\rm Be}/{}^{9}{\rm Be})_0$ ratios in Ca-rich, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), or even inferences of live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs – have suggested values $\Phi &gt; 10^5$, even as large as $\Phi \approx 6 \times 10^6$, which would make the young Sun extraordinarily active, even for a protostar. We constrain $\Phi$ by re-examining these data. We conclude: cosmogenic Ne was produced in hibonite grains as they resided in the disk; ${}^{36}{\rm Cl}$ was created in Cl-poor grains after the disk dissipated; ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ was inherited from the molecular cloud, with almost no ($&lt; 1\%$) ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ created in the disk; and there is no evidence whatsoever for any live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs. We show these data are consistent with a value $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^3$ for the first $&gt; 5$ Myr of the solar nebula. The early Sun evidently emitted a flux of X rays and SEPs not atypical for a protostar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Method for Investigating the Presence of Extragalactic Magnetic Fields</a><span class="id">[2512.03192]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extragalactic magnetic field could be detected by searching for signatures of the electromagnetic cascade initiated by high-energy photons on the intergalactic radiation and deflected by the field. This process produces a time delay and an extended gamma-ray halo around the source, which are looked for. We propose a new signature of electromagnetic echoes: the asymmetry of the gamma-ray distribution around blazars. As a measure of asymmetry, we use the offset of the gamma-ray distribution to the location of the blazar. This offset is due to the tilt of the jet of the blazar relative to the line of sight. Using a subsample of the 10 brightest BL Lacs, we exclude the range of extragalactic magnetic fields from $10^{-16}$ to $10^{-14}$ G, assuming that these objects have maintained a constant average luminosity over hundreds of thousands of years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interferometric Detection and Orbit Modeling of the Subcomponent in the Hot-dust System $κ$ Tuc A: A Low-mass Star on an Eccentric Orbit in a Hierarchical-quintuple System</a><span class="id">[2512.03209]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The system $\kappa$ Tuc A is part of a hierarchical-quintuple system and is a prime target for studies of hot-exozodiacal dust, because a time-variable near-infrared excess has been detected. We observed the system with the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) and GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and detected the stellar companion to the primary $\kappa$ Tuc Aa that was previously inferred by astrometry, $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its $L$-band flux ratio to the primary is 1.32% and its signature in the MATISSE closure phases is mostly smaller than +/- 2°, which makes $\kappa$ Tuc Ab the highest-contrast companion ever detected with MATISSE closure phases. We verified with GRAVITY that relative astrometry with milliarcsecond precision can be retrieved from MATISSE closure phases. Using multiple epochs of observations, we obtain a full orbital solution for $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.94 and a semi-major axis of 4.8au. The orbit of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab and the orbit of the wider separation companion $\kappa$ Tuc B are mutually inclined. Based on the measured flux ratio of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to Aa and their dynamical mass, we estimate the spectral type of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to be M3.5V to M4.5V. While the then unknown star $\kappa$ Tuc Ab might have caused the putative detection of hot-exozodiacal dust around $\kappa$ Tuc Aa in 2012 and 2014, this cannot be for the detection in 2019, giving rise to an intriguing system architecture. This motivates studies investigating the interplay of the low-mass star on an eccentric orbit, the hot-exozodiacal dust, and a possible planetesimal reservoir.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03227" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DESI DR1 Peculiar Velocity Survey: The Tully-Fisher Distance Catalog</a><span class="id">[2512.03227]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We calibrate the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR) using observations of spiral galaxies taken during the first year (DR1) of the DESI galaxy redshift survey.

A powerful means of unlocking this knowledge lies in measuring the auto-power spectrum and/or the cross-power spectrum of the galaxy density and momentum fields, followed by the estimation of cosmological parameters based on these spectrum measurements. In this study, we generalize the cross-power spectrum model to accommodate scenarios where the density and momentum fields are derived from distinct galaxy surveys. The growth rate of the large-scale structures of the Universe, commonly represented as $f\sigma_8$, is extracted by jointly fitting the monopole and quadrupole moments of the auto-density power spectrum, the monopole of the auto-momentum power spectrum, and the dipole of the cross-power spectrum. Our estimators, theoretical models and parameter-fitting framework have been tested using mocks, confirming their robustness and accuracy in retrieving the fiducial growth rate from simulation. These techniques are then applied to analyze the power spectrum of the DESI Bright Galaxy Survey and Peculiar Velocity Survey, and the fit result of the growth rate is $f\sigma_8=0.440^{+0.080}_{-0.096}$ at effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}=0.07$. By synthesizing the fitting outcomes from correlation functions, maximum likelihood estimation and power spectrum, yields a consensus value of $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}=0.07) = 0.450 ^{+0.055}_{-0.055}$, and correspondingly we obtain $\gamma=0.580^{+0.110}_{-0.110}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{m}=0.301^{+0.011}_{-0.011}$ and $\sigma_8=0.834^{+0.032}_{-0.032}$.

The primary purpose of this paper is to perform the calibration of the zero-point for the DESI Fundamental Plane and Tully-Fisher relations, which allows us to measure the Hubble constant, $H_0$. This sample has a lower statistical uncertainty than any previously used to measure $H_0$, and we investigate the systematic uncertainties in absolute calibration that could limit the accuracy of that measurement. We improve upon the DESI Early Data Release Fundamental Plane $H_0$ measurement by a) using a group catalog to increase the number of calibrator galaxies and b) investigating alternative calibrators in the nearby universe. Our baseline measurement calibrates to the SH0ES/Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, and finds $H_0=73.7\pm 0.06\;(\text{stat.})\pm 1.1\;(\text{syst.})$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Calibrating to surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances yields a similar $H_0$. We explore measurements using other calibrators, but these are currently less precise since the overlap with DESI peculiar velocity tracers is much smaller. In future data releases with an even larger peculiar velocity sample, we plan to calibrate directly to Cepheids and the tip of the red giant branch, which will enable the uncertainty to decrease towards a percent-level measurement of $H_0$. This will provide an alternative to supernovae as the Hubble flow sample for $H_0$ measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine-Scale Features of the Sun's Atmosphere: Spicules and Jets</a><span class="id">[2512.03253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an overview of fine-scale features in the Sun's atmosphere, with a focus on spicules and jets.

These simulations, conducted with the moving-mesh code AREPO, aim to investigate the effects of chemical separation on the ejecta and spectra of such WDs undergoing thermonuclear explosions. The distillation process alters the internal chemical stratification of the star, concentrating neutron-rich material either in a central core or in an interior shell. We model both configurations as well as a homogeneous equivalent for each case with the same $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$ content distributed evenly at all radii. Despite similar $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$ yields between the core and shell models ($0.40$ and $0.45 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ respectively), the two models yield markedly different iron-group abundances. Both distilled models showed significantly enhanced production of $^{15} \mathrm{N}$ via the decay of $^{15} \mathrm{O}$. The $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$-core model produces enhanced amounts of stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes such as $^{58} \mathrm{Ni}$ and $^{54} \mathrm{Fe}$. We highlight observational signatures associated with these differences, including potentially enhanced [$\mathrm{Ni}_{\rm II}$] lines in nebular spectra. Synthetic TARDIS spectra at early times show only moderate differences. Our results suggest that white dwarf distillation, a process linked to delayed cooling in the Gaia Q branch population, may leave detectable nucleosynthetic fingerprints in a subset of Type Ia supernovae. These findings open additional pathways to probe progenitor evolution and the role of crystallisation in shaping the diversity of thermonuclear transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surprisingly Large Doppler Shifts in Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) Solar Spectra, Resulting from an Inconspicuous Small-scale Jet in EUV Images</a><span class="id">[2512.03282]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strong EUV lineshifts in solar spectra are generally indicative of highly dynamic and explosive events that are easily detected in comparable-wavelength EUV images, with the strongest such line shifts (several 100 km/s) occurring in solar flares. Here we present observations of exceptionally strong lineshifts detected in Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) spectra outside the time of a flare-like brightening, with 195 Ang blueshifts of  200 km/s. Although the likely culprit is too weak to register in GOES Soft X-ray fluxes, EIS pinpoints the source at the edge of an active region. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) images and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms show a nondescript small-scale eruptive event at this location. We find this event likely to be an inconspicuous coronal jet, apparently triggered by converging/canceling magnetic flux patches, with plane-of-sky velocity  159+-29 km/s. AIA and HMI observations of this faint transient feature, together with observations of a slightly brighter jetting event near the same location an hour earlier, suggest that the strong EIS Doppler shifts are indeed due to a coronal jet that is hard to detect in AIA images. These observations, together with other recent studies, show that EUV Doppler maps are a much more sensitive tool for detecting small-scale eruptions than are EUV images, and those eruptions are frequently triggered by magnetic flux cancelation episodes. Such-detected small-scale eruptions, that often produce small-scale coronal-jet-like features, might propagate into and help drive the solar wind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03314" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EFT of Dark Energy with Cosmic Chronometers: Reconstructing Background EFT Functions</a><span class="id">[2512.03314]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a model-independent framework for studying cosmology within scalar-tensor theories.

Fiducial values are derived from a MontePython MCMC analysis. The derivatives of the growth-related observable, $f\sigma_8(z)$ with respect to the parameters are numerically around the fiducial model. For the Fisher analysis, we employ mock data designed for upcoming surveys, particularly Euclid and BOSS, where RSD measurements yield constraints on $f\sigma_8.$ Our results show that when both stable and unstable components are allowed, constrains on the DCDM lifetime remain weak, with $\tau_{\mathrm{dcdm}}&gt;1.18$ Gyr. In the limiting case of fully unstable dark matter ($\alpha_{\mathrm{dcdm}}=1$), the uncertainty improves to $\tau_{\mathrm{dcdm}}&gt;235.89$ Gyr.

Using numerical solution of the GPP equation, we demonstrate that a lattice of vortices ,underdensity columns that carry angular momentum, naturally forms in a ULDM halo under conditions similar to those of the Milky Way. Furthermore, we study the gravitational lensing by these vortices as a possible observational signature of BEC-ULDM.

We find that the modelling supports the conclusion of Cummings et al. (2025) that there is a significant fraction of primary Boron in its observed spectrum at low energies.

These data also reveal tension in the inferred matter density parameter -lower in DESI and higher in Planck- as well as a neutrino mass posterior that approaches the lower bounds permitted by oscillation experiments. In this work, we propose and test a conformal holographic DE (CHDE) model in which the DE density depends on a power law of the conformal time, characterized by an exponent (n). This formulation introduces a single additional parameter relative to LambdaCDM and reduces to it in the limit n = 0. We confront the CHDE model with BAO, CMB, and supernova datasets, following the same combinations used by DESI, and perform parameter inference under both flat and non-flat cosmologies. Our analyses show that LambdaCDM is not favored as the best-fit model when using CMB data alone or in joint analyses including BAO and SNla, and it is disfavored at the 4.4 sigma level for non-flat model and 4.5 sigma for the flat model. We obtain consistent values of n= -0.28 to -0.32 with uncertainties less than +-0.1 across multiple data combinations. Similar to LambdaCDM, the CHDE model predicts a lower matter density when employing DESI data instead of Planck data. This, in turn, influences the neutrino mass constraints, yielding values close to the minimal allowed range. Despite these dataset-dependent tensions, both the flat and curved CHDE models remain compatible with neutrino mass constraints from terrestrial experiments and yield posterior distributions that peaks at positive values. This behavior avoids the issue encountered in the LambdaCDM model, where the posterior peaks at negative mass values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subgrid Mean-field Dynamo Model with Dynamical Quenching in General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.03443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-scale magnetic fields are relevant for a number of dynamical processes in accretion disks, including driving turbulence, reconnection events, and launching outflows. Numerical simulations have indicated that the initial strengths and configurations of the large-scale magnetic fields have a direct imprint on the outcome of an accretion disk evolution. To facilitate future self-consistent simulations that include intrinsic dynamo processes, we derive and implement a subgrid model of a helical large-scale dynamo with dynamical quenching in general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamical simulations of geometrically thin accretion disks. By incorporating previous numerical and analytical results of helical dynamos, our model features only one input parameter, the viscosity parameter $\alpha_\text{SS}$. We demonstrate that our model can reproduce butterfly diagrams seen in previous local and global simulations. With rather aggressive parameter choice of $\alpha_\text{SS}=0.02$ and black hole spin $a_\text{BH}=0.9375$, our thin-disk model launches weak collimated polar outflows with Lorentz factor $\simeq 1.2$, but no polar outflow is present with less vigorous turbulence or less positive $a_\text{BH}$. With negative $a_\text{BH}$, we find the field configurations to appear more similar to Newtonian cases, whereas for positive $a_\text{BH}$, the poloidal field loops become distorted and the cycle period becomes sporadic or even disappears. Moreover, we demonstrate how $\alpha_\text{SS}$ can avoid to be prescribed and instead be determined by the local plasma beta. Such a fully dynamical subgrid dynamo allows for self-consistent amplification of the large-scale magnetic fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino-dominated relativistic shocked accretion flow around rotating black hole: implications for short gamma-ray bursts</a><span class="id">[2512.03447]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the physical properties of the central engine powering gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), modelled as a stellar-mass black hole accreting via a neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF). By solving the governing hydrodynamic equations, we obtain global transonic NDAF solutions featuring shock transitions and examine their role in powering GRB energetics. The NDAF solutions are explored over a broad range of black hole parameters, including its mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) and spin ($a_{\rm k}$), and accretion rate ($\dot{M}$). We find that shocked NDAFs can naturally account for the observed diversity in GRB energy output. Incorporating results from numerical simulations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star mergers, we estimate the remnant black hole mass and spin parameters for the predicted range of post-merger disk mass ($M_{\rm disk}$). Our analysis reveals that small-mass black holes with relatively low spin values can adequately reproduce the luminosities of short GRBs (SGRBs), whereas identical GRB luminosities can also be achieved for more massive black holes possessing higher spin values. Finally, we uncover a robust correlation between the black hole spin and disk mass such that $M_{\rm disk}$ decreases with increasing $a_{\rm k}$, remaining largely independent of the black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) powering GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasi-linear theory of perpendicular ion heating by critically balanced turbulence</a><span class="id">[2512.03472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfvénic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfvénic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 7 Day Multiwavelength Flare Campaign on AU Mic.

Using Ku-band data (12 to 18 GHz) from the Very Large Array and K-band data (17 to 25 GHz) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the quiescent spectrum can be decomposed into two components: one falling with frequency and one that remains flat. The flat component has a relatively steady flux density of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.14 mJy. The falling component varies in strength, but exhibits a spectral index of $\alpha$ = $-0.88 \pm 0.10$. The falling component is thus consistent with nonthermal, optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation with a corresponding power-law index similar to flares from AU Mic. While a flat component may arise from thermal, optically thin free-free emission, the observed flux density and inferred mass-loss rate are both too large compared to previous stellar wind and X-ray emission theory and models, necessitating an alternative explanation. This flat component instead matches well with an optically thick gyroresonance component integrated over multiple source regions such that the composite spectra are reasonably flat. The persistence of these components across the rotational period suggests multiple source regions, which may help explain changes in flux density and persistent high-energy electrons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03531" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The helium common-envelope wind scenario for SN 2020eyj</a><span class="id">[2512.03531]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SN 2020eyj is the first type Ia supernova (SN Ia) showing the signature of a compact helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM). Such a large CSM is difficult to explain in a single-degenerate scenario where the donor star is a helium star. Here we show that, under certain conditions, it is possible that the transfer of helium leads to a common envelope (CE) engulfing the system, similar to the common-envelope wind model proposed by Meng &amp; Podsiadlowski (2017). If in such a helium common-envelope wind (HeCEW) model the initial white dwarf (WD) mass is larger than 1.1 $M_{\rm \odot}$ and the helium star more massive than 1.8 $M_{\rm \odot}$, the mass of a helium CE can be larger than 0.3 $M_{\rm \odot}$ prior to supernova explosion. The CE mass heavily depends on the initial parameters of the binary system. A dynamical CE ejection event could occur shortly before the supernova, and then our model may naturally explain the properties of SN 2020eyj, specifically the massive He-rich CSM, its dim peak brightness, low ejecta velocity and low birth rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving the Multiple Component Outflows in PG 1211+143: I.

The primary objective is to characterize the Fe-K absorption features due to Ultra-Fast Outflow (UFO) in this Eddington-luminosity source. Observations were conducted with XRISM's Resolve and Xtend instruments, complemented by simultaneous data from XMM-Newton and NuSTAR. A historically bright phase was captured. The Resolve spectra clearly reveal a prominent P Cygni profile and resolves the Fe-K absorption into six distinct velocity components, ranging from $v = -0.074c$ to $-0.405c$. A similar superposition of multiple UFOs has been reported in PDS 456, suggesting that such a “UFO forest” structure may be a common feature of near Eddington-luminosity sources. Some UFO components exhibit narrow line widths of approximately $\sigma \sim 200\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which may indicate that the outflows have reached their terminal velocities, thereby resulting in a smaller velocity shear. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be $\dot{M}_\mathrm{out} \sim 1~M_{\odot}~\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is of the order of the Eddington accretion rate. This suggests a physically plausible scenario where the outflow is a significant channel for mass ejection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03550" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genetic Algorithm for Inferring Model Parameters for Flux Transport Dynamo Simulation</a><span class="id">[2512.03550]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Sun exhibits an 11-year cyclic variation, maintained by dynamo action in the solar interior.

The explosion epoch is constrained with power-law fits to the rising TESS and ZTF light curves, with the first ZTF detection only about 27 hr after explosion. The optical light curves show a rapid 8.8 day rise and a peak luminosity typical of SNe Ic-BL (Mr=-18.5 mag). Unlike some engine-driven events, SN 2020lao shows no early optical excess or afterglow. The lack of a shock-cooling signature in the TESS/ZTF data constrains the progenitor to a compact Wolf Rayet-like star with radius of only a few solar radii. The spectra resemble those of the X-ray flash SN 2006aj but with higher velocities. Arnett modeling of the bolometric light curve, combined with Fe II velocities, yields a nickel mass of about 0.2 solar masses, an ejecta mass of about 3.2 solar masses, and a kinetic energy of about 23x10^51 erg, corresponding to a high specific kinetic energy of about 7x10^51 erg per solar mass. Spectral-synthesis modeling broadly reproduces the photospheric spectra and suggests a somewhat lower but still large specific kinetic energy (about 5 x 10^51 erg per solar mass). Although SN 2020lao and SN 2006aj produced similar 56Ni masses, SN 2020lao exhibits specific kinetic energies larger by a factor of several.

These maps are affected by relativistic redshift-space distortions (RSDs), which become increasingly relevant on ultra-large scales. Accurate modelling of these relativistic RSDs is essential to avoid systematic biases in key cosmological measurements, such as primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG). To address this, we introduce an updated implementation of the LIGER method, LIGER4GAL, which incorporates all linear-order relativistic RSDs directly at the tracer level of high-resolution N-body simulations. We demonstrate that LIGER4GAL improves upon previous iterations of the LIGER method by reproducing the expected non-linear clustering while maintaining accuracy for relativistic RSDs on large scales. We use the updated code to generate a DESI-like sample of luminous red galaxies from the Huge MultiDark Planck simulation. By measuring the power spectrum multipoles of this sample with and without the imprint of relativistic RSDs, we assess the impact of relativistic effects on measurements of the local PNG signal ($f_\mathrm{nl}$). We find that the omission of the”finger-of-the-observer” (sourced by the peculiar velocity of the observer) effect in the power spectrum modelling can bias measurements of $f_{\rm nl}$ by more than $1$ ($0.25$) $ \sigma_{f_{\rm nl}}$ in 40% (80%) of the possible realizations of the universe if scales down to $k_\mathrm{min} = 0.0015\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ are included.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03830" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic activity on the young Sun: a case study of EK Draconis</a><span class="id">[2512.03830]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Young, solar analogue stars provide key insights into the early stages of stellar evolution, particularly in terms of magnetic activity and rotation. Their rapid rotation, high flaring rate, and enhanced surface activity make them ideal laboratories for testing stellar models or even the solar dynamo. Aims. Using long-term photometric data, we investigated the cyclic behaviour of EK Dra over the last century. We analyze its short- term activity based on 13 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) sectors. Applying Doppler imaging on high-resolution spectral data we investigate short and long-term spot evolution and surface differential rotation. Methods. We use Short-term Fourier-transform on a 120 years long archival photometric data in order to search for activity cycles. The short-term space photometry data is fitted with an analytic three-spot model, and we hand-select flares from it to analyze their phase and frequency distribution. Spectral synthesis is used to determine the astrophysical parameters of EK Dra. Using the iMap multi-line Doppler imaging code, we reconstruct 13 Doppler images. Differential rotation is derived by cross-correlating consecutive Doppler maps. Results. Long-term photometric data reveal a 10.7-12.1 year cycle that was persistently present for 120 years. In the more recent half of the light curve a 7.3-8.2 years-long signal is also visible. The distribution of the 142 flares in the TESS data shows no correlation with the rotational phase or with the spotted longitudes. The reconstructed Doppler images show a surface that varies from rotation to rotation, putting the lower limit of the spot lifetime between 10-15 days. Based on the cross-correlation of the Doppler maps, EK Dra has a solar-type differential rotation with a surface shear parameter of $\alpha_{DR} = 0.030 \pm 0.008$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cosmological Dipole in Tilted Anisotropic Universes</a><span class="id">[2512.03867]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is tentative evidence for a mismatch between the rest frames of matter and the cosmic microwave background, the &quot;quasar dipole anomaly&quot;.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), beginning full operations in late 2025, will dramatically transform solar system science by vastly expanding discoveries and providing detailed characterization opportunities across all small body populations. This includes the co-orbiting 1:1 resonant Neptune Trojans, which are thought to be dynamically hot captures from the protoplanetary disk. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, combined with the latest LSST cadence simulations, we present the very first predictions for the Neptune Trojan yield within the LSST. We forecast a model-dependent median number of $\sim130-300$ discovered Neptune Trojans, and infer a notable 2:1 detection bias toward the recently emerged L5 cloud near the galactic plane versus the L4 cloud, reflecting the lower-cadence coverage in the Northern Ecliptic Spur region that suppresses L4 detections. The additionally simulated Science Validation survey will offer the very first early insights into this understudied cloud. Around 60\% of detected main survey Neptune Trojans will meet stringent color light curve quality criteria, increasing the sample size more than fourfold compared to existing datasets. This enhanced sample will enable robust statistical analyses of Neptune Trojan color and size distributions, crucial for understanding their origins and relationship to the broader trans-Neptunian population. These comprehensive color measurements represent a major step forward in characterizing the Neptune Trojan population and will facilitate future targeted spectroscopic observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03910" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X TrA through the eyes of MATISSE: More evidence of clumpy molecular layers around C-type asymptotic giant branch stars</a><span class="id">[2512.03910]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims. The goal of this study is to further the understanding of the wind formation mechanism in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through the analysis of the close environment (within a few stellar radii) of the carbon star X TrA. Methods. X TrA was observed for the first time with the Mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment instrument (MATISSE) in the L and N bands in low spectral resolution mode (R=30), and its close surroundings were mapped in specific wavelength ranges corresponding to specific molecules ($C_2H_2$ and HCN, at 3.1 and 3.8 $\mu$m) and dust (amorphous carbon and, for example, Sic at 11.3 $\mu$m), via image reconstruction techniques. Results. The angular diameter of the star ranges from 10 mas in the L band pseudo-continuum (3.5 $\mu$m) to 20 mas at 3.1 and 11.3 $\mu$m. The reconstructed images show some mild elongated features (along the east-west direction) and asymmetric protrusions, which are most evident around 3.1 $\mu$m. Imaging results highlight the clumpy nature of the circumstellar environment, starting from the photospheric region up to more distant layers. Conclusions. The angular diameters found for X TrA in the image data are in agreement with previous photospheric diameter estimates (following VLTI/MIDI 8-13 $\mu$m observations), and their wavelength dependence is similar to values found for other carbon stars observed with MATISSE (R Scl and V Hya). The 3.1 $\mu$m images presented here show highly asymmetric features, another case of a C-rich star with irregular morphologies close to the stellar disk; this supports the notion that the $C_2H_2+HCN$ abundance distribution usually originates from a clumpy layer around carbon stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03938" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first 10years of the HAWC Gamma-Ray Observatory: science results</a><span class="id">[2512.03938]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra volcano in Mexico, began operations in March 2015.

Here, we exploit a secular resonance to stimulate the orbit of a CBP into strong, disruptive interactions with the host binary. The process requires no tertiary companion and is triggered when the general-relativistic precession of a tightening binary matches the Newtonian precession it induces in its companion planet. Adiabatic capture in this resonance sees the binary draining angular momentum from the CBP's orbit which grows steadily in eccentricity until destabilization, and eventual ejection or engulfment. We map this resonance in phase space, then investigate the dynamical outcomes of encounter in the course of tidally shrinking binaries. With the help of orbit averaged simulations of a suite of systems, we find that, around tightening binaries: eight out of ten CBPs encounter and are captured in the resonance; three out of four are `destroyed'; and survivors lurk on remote, low-transit-probability orbits. This suggests that the very process which forms tight binaries effectively clears the region where transiting CBPs could reside.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Line Polarization of Si II $λ$6355 Å in Type Ia Supernovae: A New Statistical Approach to Probe the Explosion Physics and Diversity</a><span class="id">[2512.03957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectropolarimetry provides a unique probe of ejecta asphericities, offering direct insights into the underlying explosion physics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $\lambda$6355 Åline. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $\theta$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primary gravitational waves at high frequencies I: Origin of suppression in the power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2512.03959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>[Abridged] The primary gravitational waves (PGWs) are generated in the early universe from the quantum vacuum during inflation. In slow roll inflation, the power spectrum (PS) of PGWs over large scales, which leave the Hubble radius during inflation, is nearly scale-invariant. However, over very small scales, which never leave the Hubble radius, the PS of PGWs behaves as k^2, where k denotes the wave number. We examine the PS of PGWs at such high wave numbers or frequencies when the PGWs are evolved post-inflation, through the epochs of radiation and matter domination. Firstly, we argue that the PS has to be regularized in order to truncate the unphysical k^2 rise at high frequencies. Assuming instantaneous transitions from inflation to the epochs of radiation and matter domination, we carry out the method of adiabatic regularization to arrive at the PS of PGWs over a wide range of frequencies. We show that the process of regularization truncates the k^2 rise and the PS of PGWs oscillates with a fixed amplitude about a vanishing mean value over small scales or, equivalently, at high frequencies. Secondly, we smooth the transition from inflation to radiation domination (to be precise, we smooth the 'effective potential' governing the equation of motion of PGWs) and examine the impact of the smoothing on the regularized PS of PGWs. With the help of a linear smoothing function, we explicitly show that the smoother transition leads to a power-law suppression in the amplitude of the oscillations (about the zero mean value) of the regularized PS of PGWs over small scales that never leave the Hubble radius during inflation. Our analysis indicates that, when transitions are involved, regularization as well as smooth transitions seem essential to ensure that the correlation functions of the PGWs in real space are well behaved. We discuss the directions in which our results need to be extended.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Further constraints on Jupiter's primordial structure</a><span class="id">[2512.03961]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The primordial structure of Jupiter remains uncertain, yet it holds vital clues on the planet's formation and early evolution. Recent work used dynamical constraints from Jupiter's inner moons to determine its primordial state, thereby providing a novel, formation-era anchor point for interior modeling. Building on this approach, we combine these dynamical constraints with thermal evolution simulations to investigate which primordial structures are consistent with present-day Jupiter. We present 4,250 evolutionary models of the planetary structure, including compositional mixing and helium phase separation, spanning a broad range of initial entropies and composition profiles. We find that Jupiter's present-day structure is best explained by a warm ($4.98_{-2.57}^{+3.00}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$), metal-rich dilute core inherited from formation. To simultaneously satisfy constraints on Jupiter's primordial spin, however, its envelope must have been significantly warmer ($9.32_{-0.58}^{+0.48}\, \mathrm{k_B\, m_u^{-1}}$) at the time of disk dispersal. We determine Jupiter's primordial radius to be $1.89_{-0.49}^{+0.40}\, \mathrm{R_J}$. These results provide new constraints on Jupiter's formation, suggesting that most heavy elements were accreted early during runaway gas accretion, and placing bounds on the energy dissipated during the accretion shock.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrogen-Rich to Stripped-Envelope:Observational Continuity and Biases in CCSNe</a><span class="id">[2512.04010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although historically classified into discrete subclasses, there is growing evidence that indicates that core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) categories often overlap, reflecting continuous variations in progenitor structure, mass-loss history, and circumstellar environments rather than strictly distinct channels.

Without assuming a specific inflationary scenario we focus on the evolution of pGWs after they re-enter the horizon during a cosmological epoch characterized by the presence of shear viscosity. We show that shear viscosity introduces an additional damping term in the tensor equation, modifying both the transfer function and the energy density power spectrum. For a constant shear viscosity-to-Hubble ratio the transfer function acquires an extra red tilt, while a time-dependent viscosity leads to a running spectral index $\Omega_\text{GW}\sim k^{n_\text{eff}(k)}$ controlled by the time evolution of the mean free path of the viscous fluid. Our analysis provides a general framework to analytically quantify how shear viscosity can alter the primordial gravitational wave background in standard and non-standard post-inflationary scenarios. As a case study we evaluate the effect of viscosity of the electron-photon-baryon plasma, on both the transfer function and the normalized energy density, finding a $k$-dependent blue tilt due to gravitational wave freeze-out from the viscous phase. This effect corresponds to a fractional difference of order $10^{-3}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling of Rayleigh Scattering and Interstellar Polarization for Evolved Late-Type Stars</a><span class="id">[2512.04042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Evolved late-type stars are frequently identified as photometric and spectroscopic variables, such as Mira-type or semi-regular variable objects. These stars can also be polarimetrically variable, an indicator of non-spherical geometry for spatially unresolved sources. Departures from symmetry can arise in a number of ways, such as the presence of a binary companion (e.g., multiple illumination sources for scattered light), brightness variations in the stellar atmosphere (e.g., large convective cells), or aspherical circumstellar envelopes (e.g., disks or aspherical stellar winds). Common polarigenic opacities for cool stars include Rayleigh scattering and dust scattering. The classic wavelength dependence of lambda^-4 for Rayleigh single scattering is generally straightforward; however, that signature can be confounded by interstellar polarization (ISP). We explore strategies for interpreting polarimetric observations when the interstellar polarization (ISP) cannot be removed. We introduce a &quot;hybrid&quot; spectrum that includes both Rayleigh polarization for a stellar contribution and the Serkowski Law for an interstellar contribution. We find the polarization spectral slope can be more shallow than expected from Rayleigh scattering alone. For stellar variability, shorter wavelengths give higher amplitude changes when Rayleigh scattering dominates the interstellar signal. Quite anomalous slopes can occur over limited wavelength intervals if the stellar and interstellar position angles differ by 90 deg. Results of the models are discussed in the context of photopolarimetry methods, and an application is considered in terms of variable polarization from the carbon star, R Scl.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04049" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TT Arietis: New approach to the analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations</a><span class="id">[2512.04049]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context.

Our aim is to determine the occurrence, strength, and variability of QPOs in TT Ari based on more complete data than in previous works. Methods. The data were obtained during the high state of TT Ari in October 2012 by the MOST space telescope, covering a total of 361.2 hours of continuous observation. We searched for frequencies over subsets of time using a Fourier-like power spectrum and then added the frequencies together, forming groups. Results. Our method has revealed QPOs that occur in &quot;frequency groups&quot;, which are events with a continuous oscillation of similar, constant or slowly variable frequency. We report a total of 160 frequency groups in the period range between 14 and 53 minutes (27 and 98 days-1), with two peaks in the power spectrum at 18.5 and 33.8 minutes (42.5 and 77.5 days-1). The duration of these frequency groups varies between 0.72 and 7.5 hours (average 2.8 hours) revealing between 3 and 18 complete cycles in the light curve. Most of them show significant frequency variations over the course of their duration. Sometimes two frequency groups occur simultaneously. An analysis with randomised data confirms that stochastic processes can only explain a fraction of the QPOs found. The occurrence of QPOs appears not to be related to the superhump phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multimessenger Constraints on Supermassive Dark Stars and Their Black Hole Remnants</a><span class="id">[2512.04061]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter (DM) annihilation can power the first generation of stars as long lived dark stars (DSs) that grow to supermassive scales $M_{\rm DS}\gtrsim 10^{5} M_{\odot}$ and eventually collapse into heavy black holes that could seed the supermassive black holes observed at high redshifts.

We consider a broad class of static spherically symmetric spacetimes and geometrically thin equatorial accretion disk with a prescribed inner radius and infinite outer extent, viewed by a polar observer. Depending on the inner radius of the disk, the thickness of each photon ring varies, and the rings may or may not overlap. To characterize the overlapping, we introduce the radius of merging - the value of the disk's inner radius at which two photon rings of given orders begin to overlap. Since each radius of merging is labeled by two indices corresponding to the image orders, it becomes possible to arrange these radii in the form of an infinite-dimensional matrix where only the upper right-hand corner is filled. This matrix, which we call the &quot;matrix of merging&quot;, is a signature of spacetime only, and, once known, it provides a qualitative understanding of the overlapping pattern for any chosen value of the inner radius of the disk. Remarkably, the matrix of merging exhibits several universal properties that hold for all spherically symmetric metrics and can be established even without explicit calculation of light trajectories. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that certain overlapping patterns are universally forbidden across all such spacetimes and for any inner radius of the disk. Examples for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordström black holes are provided. The main application of our study is constraining the spacetime metric and the accretion model using observed photon ring overlaps.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Thermal Relic Encyclopedia: Dark Matter Candidates Coupled to Quarks</a><span class="id">[2512.03133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thermal freeze-out is a compelling framework for naturally generating the dark matter abundance.

Using hierarchical Bayesian inference on the recent GWTC-4.0 dataset, we compare these features across all models and assess how well each scenario explains the data. We find that the data strongly favor the presence of a positive correlation between mass and spin magnitude, in agreement with previous studies. Furthermore, the hierarchical scenario provides a better fit to the observations, due to the inclusion of second-generation mergers leading to higher spins at larger masses. The current dataset is not informative enough about spin orientation: the cluster (random orientations) and AGN (aligned orientations) scenarios have comparable Bayesian evidence.

We show that the radial motion of the charged test particle is governed by completely the same equation as that in the case of no magnetic field. This result implies that the black hole will acquire the electric charge if it is surrounded by the collisionless plasma composed of protons and electrons which obey the Maxwell velocity distribution. The drastically different situation appears in the tangential motions of charged test particles due to the magnetic field. The trajectory of a charged test particle in the black hole with the magnetic field of the order of 10 Gauss near the black hole, is confined on a very thin cone as long as the specific angular momentum of the particle is not much larger than the gravitational radius of the black hole times the speed of light. This result leads to a possibility that a plasma lump can hover over the black hole and is very hot, in the monopole magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03529" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-probe analysis of strong-field effects in $f(Q)$ gravity</a><span class="id">[2512.03529]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Covariant $f(Q)$ gravity is a viable extension of General Relativity, however its strong-field predictions remain largely untested. Using the static, spherically symmetric black-hole solutions of the theory, we confront it with the most stringent probes available: black-hole shadows, Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) measurements, S2-star precession, and strong gravitational lensing. We show that the two admissible solution branches behave very differently: Case I produces negligible deviations from Schwarzschild solution, whereas Case II yields significant, potentially observable corrections to the photon sphere and shadow size. From the EHT shadow diameters of M87* and Sgr A*, we obtain tight bounds, which are further strengthened by strong-lensing coefficients. These results provide the sharpest strong-field constraints on covariant $f(Q)$ gravity to date, and point toward future tests using next-generation horizon-scale imaging and precision Galactic-center astrometry.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Decays of Secluded Scalars and Graviton Dark Radiation</a><span class="id">[2512.03662]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss graviton dark radiation produced by the decay of a secluded scalar field that couples to the Standard Model (SM) only through gravity. Such scalar fields are long-lived, and their decay channels generically include gravitons. If such particles existed and dominated the early universe, a sizable branching ratio into gravitons would yield non-negligible dark radiation that significantly alters the subsequent thermal history of the universe. In this work, we focus on the dark glueball as a representative secluded hidden scalar and compare the decay rates into SM particles via a non-minimal coupling to gravity with those into gravitons, paying attention to how the breaking of conformal invariance affects the amount of graviton dark radiation. We find that decays into the SM are dominated by two-body decay channels into Higgs bosons and gluons. In particular, when the Higgs field has a large non-minimal coupling to gravity, the production of graviton dark radiation is naturally suppressed in the metric formalism, and the SM sector is preferentially reheated and energy transfer to other hidden sectors is suppressed. Finally, we present the expected gravitational-wave spectrum resulting from dark glueball domination.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework for black-hole spectroscopy: a case study on GW250114 in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</a><span class="id">[2512.03713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black-hole spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful probe of strong-field gravity in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations – modeled as damped sinusoids – directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $\zeta$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $\zeta$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $\zeta$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A strategy for optimal material identification in solar dark photon absorption</a><span class="id">[2512.03801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark photons with masses in the 1-100 eV range can be produced in the Sun and subsequently absorbed in terrestrial detectors, offering a promising avenue for probing hidden-sector physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we develop a theoretically grounded strategy to identify optimal detector materials for solar dark photon absorption. Our strategy builds on a material-independent upper limit on the absorption rate, which we derive from Kramers-Kronig relations applied separately to the longitudinal and transverse dark photon modes. We show how the optimal material properties depend on the dark photon mass relative to the detector's plasma frequency, identifying the conditions under which a detector can saturate the theoretical upper limit. We then assess the performance of commonly used detector materials in light of these criteria and comment on the prospects of metamaterials featuring tunable plasma frequencies.

Our aim is to characterize this evolution in different types of solar active region structures as well as in different atmospheric layers. We wish to assert how the measured changes relate to different magnetic topologies by computing abundance enhancement in different conditions using the ponderomotive force model. Leveraging spectroscopic observations from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument on board Solar Orbiter, we use extreme ultraviolet lines from ions formed across a broad temperature range–from the upper chromosphere to the low corona–and we perform relative abundance ratios following differential emission measure analysis. This methodology yields relative abundance maps from low, intermediate, and high first ionization potential elements. We obtain the temporal evolution of a number of abundance ratios for different structures on the Sun. We compare these results with the outcomes of the ponderomotive force model. We find good correlation between the model and our results, suggesting an Alfvén-wave driven fractionation of the plasma. Fan loops, loop footpoints and active region boundaries exhibit coronal abundances, while the active region core shows more photospheric-like composition. A slow and steady increase in the magnesium to neon relative first ionization potential bias values is observed, starting around 1.5 and increasing by about 50\% after two days. The sulfur to oxygen evolution coupled with the model brings evidence of resonant waves fractionating the plasma in transition region structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The radio afterglow of the ultra-long GRB 220627A</a><span class="id">[2502.13435]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the discovery of the radio afterglow of the most distant ultra-long gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected to date, GRB 220627A at redshift $z=3.084$. Its prompt gamma-ray light curve shows a double-pulse profile, with the pulses separated by a period of quiescence lasting ${\sim} 15$ min, leading to early speculation it could be a strongly gravitationally lensed GRB. However, our analysis of the \textit{Fermi}/GBM spectra taken during the time intervals of both pulses show clear differences in their spectral energy distributions, disfavouring the lensing scenario. We observed the radio afterglow from 7 to 456 d post-burst: an initial, steep decay ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-2}$) is followed by a shallower decline ($F_{\nu} \propto t^{-1/2}$) after ${\sim} 20$ d. There are three scenarios that could explain these radio properties: (i) energy injection from an additional, slower ejecta component catching up to the external shock; (ii) a stratified density profile going as $n \propto r^{-8/3}$; or alternatively, (iii) the presence of a slow, wide ejecta component in addition to a fast, narrow ejecta component. We also conducted an independent test of the lensing hypothesis via Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at ${\sim} 12$ d post-burst by searching, for the first time, for multiple images of the candidate lensed GRB afterglow. Our experiment highlighted the growing need for developments in real-time correlation capabilities for time-critical VLBI experiments, particularly as we advance towards the SKA and ngVLA era of radio astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars</a><span class="id">[2505.10133]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate nonradial $f$-mode oscillations of protoneutron stars in full general relativity, employing equations of state described by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory or the relativistic mean field model, while assuming isentropy and fixed lepton fractions for the internal structure.

Such companion would appear as a runaway star, retaining its pre-explosion orbital velocity along with a kick imparted by the supernova ejecta. It might be rapidly rotating, from being tidally locked with the white dwarf prior to explosion in a very close binary. For this study, we perform a series of multidimensional hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the interaction between M-dwarf companions and SN ejecta, followed by post-impact stellar evolution modeling using the MESA code. Our initial models in the 3D simulations had high spin angular momenta and the effects of magnetic braking have been included. They very significantly reduce the final rotation. A surviving companion candidate, MV-G272, has recently been discovered in the supernova remnant G272.2-3.2, which is an 8.9$\sigma$ proper motion outlier, although being slowly rotating. Our results show that the properties of this companion (luminosity, effective temperature, surface gravity) can be reproduced by our post-impact M-dwarf models. The slow rotation, which is a common characteristic with several proposed hypervelocity SN companions, can be explained by magnetic braking during the post-impact evolution, thus supporting the possibility that the MV-G272 star is the surviving companion of the Type Ia supernova now found as G272.2-3.2 SNR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06841" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic baryon census with fast radio bursts and gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2507.06841]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic baryon density fraction ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) is intrinsically correlated with the Hubble constant ($H_0$) through the critical density of the Universe.

In this paper, we generate mock BNS merger samples using binary population synthesis model and classify their post-merger remnants–black hole (BH) and magnetar, (i.e., long-lived supramassive NS and stable NS), based on results from numerical simulations. We then construct merger-nova radiation models to estimate their luminosity function.

In this context, UNIONS enables the selection of $u$-dropout high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBGs). We perform a MCMC-based forecast to estimate the uncertainties on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and on a galaxy bias parameter, which captures our uncertainty in the tracer bias.

Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining ultra light fermionic dark matter with Milky-Way observations</a><span class="id">[1811.11125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The equation of state for a degenerate gas of fermions at zero temperature in the non-relativistic case is a polytrope, i.e. $p \sim\rho^{5/3}/m_F^{8/3}$. If dark matter is modeled by such a non-interacting fermion, this dependence in the mass of the fermion $m_F$ explains why if dark matter is very heavy the effective pressure of dark matter is negligible. Nevertheless, if the mass of the dark matter is very small, the effective pressure can be very large, and thus a system of self-gravitating fermions can be formed. In this work we model the dark matter halo of the Milky-Way by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, with the equation of state for a partially degenerate ultralight non-interacting fermion. We found that to fit the rotational velocity curve of the Milky-Way, the mass of the fermion should be in the range $31.5 ~\mbox{eV} &lt; m_F &lt; 35~$eV at $90\%$ C.L. Moreover, the central density is restricted to be in the range of $1.2 &lt; \rho_0&lt;1.7$ GeV/cm$^3$ at $90\%$ C.L. The fermionic dark matter halo has a very different profile as compared with the standard Navarro-Frenk-White profile, thus, the possible indirect signals for annihilating dark matter may change by orders of magnitude.

While previous analyses assumed relativistic production, asteroid-mass PBHs, relevant to upcoming experiments like AMEGO-X, likely produce pions and ALPs non-relativistically when their masses exceed 10 MeV. To account for mass dependence in Hawking radiation, we revisit the greybody factors for massive scalars from Schwarzschild black holes, revealing significant mass corrections to particle production rates compared to the projected AMEGO-X sensitivity. We highlight the importance of considering non-relativistic $\pi^0$ production in interpreting PBH gamma-ray signals, essential for determining PBH properties. Additionally, we comment on the potential suppression of pion production due to form factor effects when producing extended objects via Hawking radiation. We also provide an example code for calculating the Hawking radiation spectrum of massive scalar particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Applicability of multi-component study on Bayesian searches for targeted anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave background</a><span class="id">[2411.19761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stochastic background gravitational waves have not yet been detected by ground-based laser interferometric detectors, but recent improvements in detector sensitivity have raised considerable expectations for their eventual detection. Previous studies have introduced methods for exploring anisotropic background gravitational waves using Bayesian statistics. These studies represent a groundbreaking approach by offering physically motivated anisotropy mapping that is distinct from the Singular Value Decomposition regularization of the Fisher Information Matrix. However, they are limited by the use of a single model, which can introduce potential bias when dealing with complex data that may consist of a mixture of multiple models. Here, we demonstrate the bias introduced by a single-component model approach in the parametric interpretation of anisotropic stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds, and we confirm that using multiple-component models can mitigate this bias.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09050" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Late-time acceleration and structure formation in interacting $α$-attractor dark energy models</a><span class="id">[2504.09050]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological dynamics of interacting dark energy within the framework of $\alpha$-attractor models. Specifically, we analyze the associated autonomous system, focusing on its fixed points that represent dark energy and scaling solutions, along with their stability conditions. We employ center manifold theory to address cases where some fixed points display eigenvalues with zero and negative real parts. The model reveals attractors describing dark energy, enabling a smooth transition from the radiation-dominated era to the matter-dominated era, and ultimately into the dark-energy-dominated phase. Additionally, we identify a scaling matter solution capable of modifying the growth rate of matter perturbations during the matter-dominated epoch. Consequently, we study the evolution of matter perturbations by obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions to the density contrast evolution equation. Based on these results, we compute numerical solutions for the weighted growth rate $f\sigma_{8}$, indicating that interacting $\alpha$-attractor dark energy models may provide a better fit to structure formation data than the standard $\Lambda$CDM scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20071" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WIMP/FIMP dark matter and primordial black holes with memory burden effect</a><span class="id">[2506.20071]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The lifetime of primordial black holes (PBHs), which formed in the early universe, can be extended by the memory burden effect. Light PBHs may exist today and be candidates for dark matter (DM). We assume that DM is made of thermally produced weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), WIMPs produced via the Hawking radiation of PBHs, and PBHs that survived Hawking evaporation via the memory burden effect. Feebly interacting massive particles (FIMPs) are alternatives to WIMPs. This paper shows that a small memory burden is preferable if the thermal production of WIMPs or FIMPs is much larger than the effect of PBH particle production via Hawking radiation. In addition, we show that the lower limit of the DM mass, called the warm DM (WDM) constraint, decreases with the memory burden effect of PBHs. Results suggest that the WDM constraint is more effective for FIMPs than for WIMPs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Net Charge Accretion in Magnetized Kerr Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2511.22356]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the charging process of a rotating Kerr black hole of mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$ immersed in a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically uniform magnetic field of strength $B_{0}$. In Wald's classic analysis (Wald 1974), which was based on the assumption of vanishing injection energy, the black hole was predicted to acquire a universal &quot;saturation charge&quot; $Q_{\mathrm{w}}=2B_{0}J$. However, the physical mechanism that sets the saturation charge must ultimately be governed by the competition between the absorption rates of positively and negatively charged particles. Motivated by this observation, we revisit the problem in the framework of a simple accretion model, where two dilute, equivalent fluxes of charged particles of opposite signs are injected from infinity along the magnetic field lines. The problem then reduces to that of individual particle motion in the electromagnetic field of the magnetized Kerr black hole. Using a combination of numerical and analytical tools, we determine the domains of absorption and establish both lower and upper bounds on the corresponding absorption cross sections. At $Q=Q_\mathrm{w}$ these bounds reveal a systematic difference between the two charge signs. In particular, for sufficiently strong magnetic fields, the lower bound on the absorption cross section for the &quot;attracted&quot; charge exceeds the upper bound for the &quot;repelled&quot; one. This charge accretion imbalance (which we find to become extreme at the limit of large $B_{0}$) indicates a persistent net charge accretion at $Q=Q_{\mathrm{w}}$, implying that the actual saturation charge must differ from Wald's charge $Q_{\mathrm{w}}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Letelier black hole immersed in an electromagnetic universe</a><span class="id">[2512.00102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.</p></div></details></article></body>
