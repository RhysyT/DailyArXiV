<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovering Einstein Mature View of Gravitation: A Dynamical Reconstruction Grounded in the Equivalence Principle</a><span class="id">[2601.16246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The historical and conceptual foundations of General Relativity are revisited, putting the main focus on the physical meaning of the invariant ds, the Equivalence Principle, and the precise interpretation of spacetime geometry. It is argued that Albert Einstein initially sought a dynamical formulation in which ds encoded the gravitational effects, without invoking curvature as a physical entity. The now more familiar geometrical interpretation (identifying gravitation with spacetime curvature) gradually emerged through his collaboration with Marcel Grossmann and the adoption of the Ricci tensor in 1915. Anyhow, in his 1920 Leiden lecture, Einstein explicitly reinterpreted spacetime geometry as the state of a physical medium (an ether endowed with metrical properties but devoid of mechanical substance) thereby actually rejecting geometry as an independent ontological reality. Building upon this mature view, gravitation is reconstructed from the Weak Equivalence Principle, understood as the exact compensation between inertial and gravitational forces acting on a body under a uniform gravitational field. From this fundamental principle, together with an extension of Fermat Principle to massive objects, the invariant ds is obtained, first in the static case, where the gravitational potential modifies the flow of proper time. Then, by applying the Lorentz transformation to this static invariant, its general form is derived for the case of matter in motion. The resulting invariant reproduces the relativistic form of Newton second law in proper time and coincides with the weak field limit of General Relativity in the harmonic gauge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tribute to Tullio Bressani, Bogdan Povh and Toshimitsu Yamazaki</a><span class="id">[2601.16678]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this HYP2025 talk I pay tribute to Tullio Bressani (1940-2024), Bogdan Povh (1932-2024) and Toshimitsu Yamazaki (1934-2025), all of whom made lasting contributions to shaping up Strangeness Nuclear Physics. Yoshinori Akaishi's (1941-2025) record is also noted.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</a><span class="id">[2507.10959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Are your perceptions, memories and observational data, a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe, having no correlation with the actual past state of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against this &quot;Boltzmann brain&quot; hypothesis. Complicating these arguments have been the many subtle – and very often implicit – joint dependencies among these arguments and others that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even for Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These dependencies can easily lead to circular reasoning. To avoid this problem, since all of these arguments involve the stochastic properties of the dynamics of the universe's entropy, we begin by formalizing that dynamics as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process, which we call the entropy conjecture. Crucially, like all stochastic processes, the entropy conjecture does not specify any time(s) which it should be conditioned on in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning times and associated entropy values must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its &quot;1000CE&quot; variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that these all make an arbitrary assumption that the dynamics of the universe's entropy should be conditioned on a single event at a single moment in time, differing only in the details of their assumptions. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CosmoSlider: An educational tool for cosmology</a><span class="id">[2601.16919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how cosmological parameters influence the cosmic microwave background (CMB) power spectra is a central component of modern cosmology education, but interactive exploration is often limited by computational cost or technical complexity. We present CosmoSlider, a lightweight visualization tool that enables real-time exploration of CMB power spectra as multiple cosmological parameters are varied simultaneously. The tool employs a neural-network emulator implemented using TensorFlow Lite, allowing rapid evaluation of spectra without relying on large grids of precomputed models or on-demand execution of Einstein–Boltzmann solvers. CosmoSlider is available both as an iOS application and as a web-based tool, making it accessible across platforms and suitable for use in classrooms, lectures, and self-guided study. By providing immediate visual feedback, CosmoSlider supports the development of intuition for the physical processes underlying CMB anisotropies and serves as a complementary resource to traditional theoretical instruction.</p></div></details></article>
