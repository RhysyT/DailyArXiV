<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A century of the Bose-Einstein condensation concept and half a century of the JINR experiments for observation of condensate in the superfluid 4He (He II)</a><span class="id">[2510.03378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This short review is devoted to celebration of two major events in quantum physics. The first one is the birth of the concept of Bose-Einstein condensation (1925) and the second is the experimental proof that it does exist and appears in the liquid 4He simultaneously with superfluidity below the $\lambda$-point (1975). The both of these events are tightly related to the Bogoliubov theory of superfluidity (1947). The existence of condensate in the system of interacting bosons is the key ansatz of this theory. Therefore, the experiments started in JINR in 1975 confirmed this prediction of the Bogoliubov theory that superfluidity of the liquid 4He (He II) should emerge at the same time as the Bose-Einstein condensation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment on &quot;Comment on Galina Weinstein's article entitled 'Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincaré and Special Relativity' &quot;</a><span class="id">[2510.03793]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper provides a systematic response to the criticisms raised by Jean-Marc Ginoux in response to my review of his book on the history of relativity. Whereas my review was written in a strictly academic manner, Ginoux's commentary intermingles mathematical objections with ad hominem insinuations about both Einstein and me. The purpose of this reply is twofold: first, to clarify the historiographical and conceptual issues at stake in the interpretation of Einstein's 1905 paper and Poincaré's contributions of 1905–1906; and second, to demonstrate why the conflation of algebraic form with conceptual content leads to distorted conclusions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Wrongs Make One Right</a><span class="id">[2510.04962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An influential argument for scientific realism posits that, if scientific theories were not true, their empirical success would be a coincidence.

It is the aim of my short treatise to introduce, at a hopefully well digestible level, into underlying antiquity's concepts of physics, astrology, and astronomy around the time of Christ's birth and to demonstrate their essential developments up to the early modern period. In the latter, Kepler played a significant role. His contributions enabled him to calculate back to the year 7 BC with astonishing precision, locating a triple great conjunction in Pisces, which was then complemented by Mars. This is confirmed by both Babylonian tradition and modern astronomy. The following background provided may be specifically helpful for a more theologically oriented audience, also because the controversy surrounding &quot;geocentric&quot; and &quot;heliocentric&quot; world systems (Copernicus) is touched upon. And, because the overall context raises questions for theology, with which the epilogue concludes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">About testing Bell locality at colliders</a><span class="id">[2503.18535]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy colliders enable the testing of quantum mechanics at its most fundamental level, in the presence of strong and electroweak interactions, with systems that consist of qubits (fermions) and qutrits (massive spin-1 bosons). Quantum state tomography at colliders enables the witnessing of entanglement and Bell non-locality, two defining characteristics of quantum mechanics. We offer a comprehensive explanation of the underlying principles and the methods employed to achieve this remarkable feat.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surveying the State of Writing Education in Physics and Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2510.03493]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Writing is a critical skill for modern science, enabling collaboration, scientific discourse, public outreach, and more. Accordingly, it is important to consider how physicists and astronomers are trained to write. This study aims to understand the landscape of science writing education, specifically in physics and astronomy, in higher education in the United States. An online survey probing various aspects of their writing training in both undergraduate and graduate school was administered to 515 participants who have obtained training in physics and/or astronomy, or related fields, at the level equal to or beyond upper-division undergraduate study. Humanities and writing requirement courses appear to have a key role in general writing education, while laboratory courses and feedback from mentors are the dominant modes of science writing education in undergraduate and graduate school respectively. There is substantial variation in the quality of writing education in physics and astronomy, often dependent on the student's institution and/or mentor. Some participants also report that their success in disciplinary writing was a result of a solid foundation from K-12 education and/or self-direction towards resources; such reliance on past experiences and student background may contribute to inequality in the field. Many participants also stated a clear desire for more structured writing training to be available in the field. We provide suggestions for how to implement such training to meet the needs of the community identified in the survey.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualising Quantum Entanglement Using Interactive Electronic Quantum Dice</a><span class="id">[2510.04931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quantum entanglement is difficult to teach because it is microscopic and non classical. We present interactive electronic dice that simulate core quantum ideas through haptic interaction and visual feedback. Each die represents a six state system with a superposition display and basis dependent measurement. A pair of dice can be prepared in an entangled mode that yields anti correlated outcomes which sum to seven when measured in the same colour basis while remaining uncorrelated across different bases. The platform supports classroom demonstrations from basic superposition and measurement to simplified quantum key distribution with single die and entanglement based protocols. The design uses standard components, two custom PCBs, orientation sensing, cryptographic quality randomness, and low power wireless proximity detection. All hardware files and code are open source to enable adoption. Initial implementations with university and secondary school audiences suggest that the tangible and visual nature of the dice helps learners form intuitive models of superposition, measurement, and entanglement correlations.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 1908 Tunguska event and the atmospheric optical anomalies</a><span class="id">[2510.03239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper is a continuation of a series of works, devoted to various aspects of the 1908 Tunguska event. In the late June - early July, 1908 there were various optical anomalies in the atmosphere. Early the Author already considered &quot;bright nights&quot;, and in this paper some other atmospheric optical anomalies are considered, such as prolonged twilights, etc. Much attention is paid to the review of works on the study of atmospheric transmission at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in 1908. The main features of the atmospheric optical anomalies and their consequences for the interpretations of the Tunguska event are described. It is shown that neither the asteroidal nor the cometary interpretation of the Tunguska event is consistent with the anomalies. The geophysical interpretation can explain the atmospheric optical anomalies at the qualitative level at least. Quantitative explanation is currently difficult due to limited observational data and the lack of clarity in the details of physical phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strategic Communication Protocols for Interstellar Objects Using a Threat-Communication Viability Index and the Information-Communication Paradox</a><span class="id">[2510.03973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strategic Communication Protocols provide a structured approach for first contact with interstellar objects that demonstrate technological characteristics and high levels of threat. The protocols find their starting point in an ISO Information-Communication Paradox, namely, as our knowledge of an ISO's threatening capabilities increases, the probability of successful communication decreases while the urgency of communication attempts simultaneously intensifies. From this paradox, a Threat-Communication Viability Index is created to describe when the value of communication attempts outweighs strategic silence. The index scores the situation and operates as a decision-making tool for stakeholders tracking an ISO. The communication protocols subsequently outline several diplomatic strategies in cases where the index recommends communication.</p></div></details></article></body>
