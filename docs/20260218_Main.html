For this we approximately model the merger site electromagnetic fields as the superposition of two rotating dipolar stellar magnetic fields at the thousand–km scale when both magnetospheres are not largely distorted. We capture the time-sliced near-zone magnetospheric geometry relevant for axion–photon mixing. Plasma effects are incorporated through an effective Goldreich–Julian charge density, used to determine the effective plasma frequency and the location of resonant conversion surfaces. Our results show that axion–photon resonant conversion in binary magnetospheres mostly occurs on extended peanut-shaped surfaces whose global geometry evolves as the binary inspiral evolves. As a consequence, the total electromagnetic power emitted through axion–photon conversion exhibits a characteristic dependence on axion mass and a slow temporal modulation correlated with the gravitational wave frequency emission. This feature is potentially detectable for $m_a \in [50,170] \,\rm \mu eV$ and set $g_{a \gamma} \lesssim 10^{-11}\rm \,GeV^{-1}$ as it lies within the sensitivity limits of current or planned radio observation missions. In light of our results we discuss the opportunity of binary neutron star inspirals as time-dependent, multimessenger probes of axion physics, and motivate coordinated searches combining gravitational wave observations with radio and millimeter wavelength electromagnetic measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15096" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSR J0024$-$7204ai: a massive, eccentric binary system in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae</a><span class="id">[2602.15096]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we present PSR J0024$-$7204ai, a 13.026-ms binary pulsar recently discovered in the globular cluster 47 Tucanae by the MeerKAT radio telescope. This is the slowest spinning pulsar known in this globular cluster, and has a $\sim1.67$-day orbit with an eccentricity of $e\approx0.18$. Although it was not yet possible to derive an unambiguous phase-connected timing solution, by combining detections obtained from MeerKAT and archival Parkes data we were able to measure the rate of advance of periastron to high significance, $\dot{\omega}$ = 0.1601 $\pm 0.0046$ deg yr$^{-1}$. This value implies a total system mass of $2.41 \pm 0.11\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ (68.3\% C. L.), which, when combined with the binary mass function, gives a maximum pulsar mass of $\sim 1.7 \, \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a minimum companion mass of $\sim 0.7\, \mathrm{M}_\odot$. Apart from being the slowest pulsar in 47 Tucanae, its orbit is by far the most eccentric and its companion is the most massive among all known binary pulsars in this globular cluster. One possibility is that system is an old MSP - Carbon-Oxygen White Dwarf binary, whose orbit was perturbed by stellar dynamical interactions in the cluster core. Further follow-up observations of this system will be essential for a more detailed characterisation of this system and its evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UV and Optical Signatures of Late-time Disk Instabilities in Tidal Disruption Events</a><span class="id">[2602.15103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are unique probes of evolving accretion in supermassive black holes. Recent models of TDE disks show that they undergo brief thermal instabilities with temporal super-Eddington accretion at late times, which has been suggested as a possibility to explain the ubiquitous late radio emergence in TDEs. We model the ultraviolet (UV) and optical signatures of such disk instabilities, expected from the accretion power being reprocessed by the optically-thick outflow following super-Eddington accretion. Our model predicts brief UV-bright transients lasting for days, with luminosities of $10^{42}$-$10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in near-UV and $10^{41}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in optical for a typical TDE by a $10^6~M_\odot$ black hole. These could be detectable by near-future surveys such as ULTRASAT, Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Argus Array, for TDEs of redshifts out to $\approx 0.1$. We further conduct a search for these transients in existing nearby TDEs using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility, placing upper limits on the flare rate for each TDE of $1$-$2$ yr$^{-1}$ dependent on the outflow mass. In the era of future surveys, combined UV/optical and radio monitoring would be an important test to the disk instability phenomena, as well as its explanation for the late-time radio emission in TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABCMB: A Python+JAX Package for the Cosmic Microwave Background Power Spectrum</a><span class="id">[2602.15104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present ABCMB, a differentiable Einstein-Boltzmann solver for the cosmic microwave background (CMB). ABCMB is a complete code capturing important effects to linear order in $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ cosmology. It computes the CMB power spectrum and includes effects like lensing, polarization, massive neutrinos, and a state-of-the-art treatment of BBN and recombination. ABCMB has sub-percent-level agreement with CLASS and can be run on a GPU with competitive, and sometimes even faster, run times. It is refactored compared to previous codes and takes advantage of object-oriented programming to improve extensibility, meaning new physics can be added to it without the need for modifying source files. ABCMB provides accurate and stable gradients to the user, making Fisher analyses straightforward, and enabling the use of efficient gradient-based sampling methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital eccentricity can make neutron star g-mode resonances observable with current gravitational-wave detectors</a><span class="id">[2602.15111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamical tides can provide us vital information about the properties of neutron star (NS) matter. This is particularly true for g-modes, whose frequency and tidal coupling are highly sensitive to the composition of NSs, especially in their centers, where microphysical models are the least reliable. However, due to their weak coupling to external tidal fields, their effect on the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of binary inspirals can be difficult to observe. Here we show that the detectability of these tides can be significantly enhanced by binary NSs with moderate eccentricities. This is primarily due to higher eccentric harmonics in the early phase of the binary evolution experiencing larger phase shifts, which they transport to the sensitive band of GW detectors. In addition, g-mode tides in eccentric binaries undergo several epicyclic resonances, which also amplify the total phase shift. We demonstrate that these effects increase the detectability of g-mode dynamical tides by more than an order of magnitude for eccentricities of $e_\mathrm{10Hz}\sim0.2-0.4$, making it possible to put robust constraints on g-mode properties using current GW detectors, while all relevant models could potentially be constrained with eccentric binary NSs with Einstein Telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection horizon for the neutrino burst from the stellar helium flash</a><span class="id">[2602.15119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low-mass stars ($M\lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) ignite helium under degenerate conditions, eventually causing a nuclear run-away – the helium flash. The alpha-capture process on $^{14}$N produces a large amount of $^{18}$F, whose subsequent decay spawns an intense $\nu_e$ burst (with average energy of $0.38$ MeV) lasting about a day. We show that, in addition, a strong $1.7$ MeV neutrino line is generated by electron capture on $^{18}$F. Detection is hindered by large backgrounds in state-of-the-art neutrino observatories, such as JUNO. In next-generation facilities, such as the Jinping neutrino experiment, the horizon for a detection with a local significance of $3 \sigma$ would be extended to almost $3$ pc. Although helium flashes occur a few times per year in our Galaxy, there are no stellar candidates approaching the tip of the red giant branch within $10$ pc. Hence, to date, asteroseismology remains the most promising tool for probing the most energetic thermonuclear event in the life of a low-mass star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mimicking the large-scale structure of the Local Universe. Synthetic pre-labelled galaxies in large-scale structures</a><span class="id">[2602.15141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current observational and simulated large-scale structure (LSS) catalogues often lack consistency in assigning galaxies to specific structures, due to the absence of a universally accepted classification criterion. With the aim to generate synthetic empirical data for fine-tuning LSS classification algorithms, as well as to train machine learning (ML)/deep learning (DL) models for the same purpose, this work presents a purely geometrical simulation based on statistical spatial properties found in LSS surveys, using the spectroscopic main galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) catalogue up to a redshift of z 0.1 as a specific use case. A parallelism between the LSS and the Voronoi tessellation was utilised, in which the nodes, links, surfaces, and cells of the diagram correspond to clusters, filaments, walls, and voids, respectively. The simulation used random positions within voids as seeds for tessellating the 3D space. The resulting structures were randomly populated with galaxies that adhere to the statistical properties of their observational respective structures. As the galaxies were generated, they were tagged with their corresponding structure. In each simulation, six LSS mock catalogues were generated, following the statistical behaviour observed in the SDSS catalogue, depending on the structure they belong to. The Malmquist bias and the Fingers of God effect were simulated as well. We present a novel geometrical LSS simulator, where generated galaxies mimic the statistical properties of their observational belonging structure. The simulator was tuned to mimic the SDSS catalogue, although any other catalogue can be considered. With the generated catalogue, it is possible to adjust the LSS classification algorithms, train and test ML/DL models, and benchmark several LSS classification methods using this pre-labelled data to contrast their results and performance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15157" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The eruptive young star IRAS 21204+4913</a><span class="id">[2602.15157]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The results of photometric, polarimetric, and spectroscopic observations are presented for the young star IRAS 21204+4913, whose visible brightness has increased by $\approx 5^{\rm m}$ since October 2025. The star's absorption spectrum in the $0.36 - 0.75 \mu$m range resembles those of A - F giants and supergiants, but it also exhibits molecular TiO bands. The brightening was accompanied by a significant increase in the degree of polarization of the stellar radiation (to $\approx 16 \%$ in the I-band), likely due to scattering by dust in an expanding circumstellar shell. The P Cygni profile of the H$\alpha$ line implies a dusty wind velocity of $\approx 300$ km/s. We believe that the outburst of IRAS 21204+4913 is caused by an increase in the accretion rate of protoplanetary disk's matter onto the young star with a mass of $\lesssim 0.5$ M$_\odot$ to $\gtrsim 3\times 10^{-5}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. Furthermore, IRAS 21204+4913 displays several unusual features: the dependence of the width and radial velocity of absorption lines on the excitation potential, emission in the TiO molecular bands, and a comparably bright outburst that occured in 1948. Several T Tauri stars and a group of Herbig-Haro objects are found in the vicinity of the star.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three-Dimensional Kinematics of the Oxygen-rich Supernova Remnant G292.0+1.8</a><span class="id">[2602.15165]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studying the remnants of young core-collapse supernovae (SNe) can yield insight into the chemical composition of their progenitors and the geometry of the explosions. The supernova remnant (SNR) G292.0+1.8 is one of only three known oxygen-rich SNRs in the galaxy-remnants of core-collapse for which relatively pure fragments of ejecta can be seen. Several dozen ejecta knots from G292.0+1.8 were the subject of a proper motion analysis, based on [O III] 5007-Angstrom images taken over a 22-year baseline by Winkler et al. 2009 ( arXiv:0810.1935 ). They determined that the transverse velocities of the filaments are linearly proportional to their distances from a common expansion center, thus the O-rich filaments have been traveling with little deceleration since the initial supernova event,about 3000 years ago. In this paper, we use optical spectra of G292.0+1.8, all taken from the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), to measure radial velocities for 93 knots. Assuming un-decelerated expansion, as indi- cated by the proper motions, the radial velocity should be proportional to the distance from the center along the line of sight, just as the proper motions are proportional to the transverse distance. Therefore, we can map the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of the SNR. We find that the knots generally follow a broad bi-conical distribution, suggesting that the supernova explosion produced broad jets of ejecta. This structure is similar to that seen in some other young core-collapse supernova remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helium superluminous SN 2021bnw : an explosion of a massive star with a pre-outburst</a><span class="id">[2602.15255]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) remain an intriguing topic in supernova (SN) transient astronomy. While the majority of SLSNe are shown to be explained by energy streaming from the newly born magnetar, there are others which are powered by different mechanisms. We analyse the pseudo-bolometric light curve of the nearby helium-rich SLSN 2021bnw. We built models and run hydrodynamics radiative-transfer simulations with STELLA. Our best-fit models include 15-22.5 Msun of ejecta enriched with 1.7 Msun of 56 Ni and carrying energy of 4 foe, and colliding w ith 7 Msun of circumstellar matter which match the observed light curve very well. The early data can be explained as cooling of an expanding shell with the mass of 0.5 Msun and kinetic energy of 0.7 foe. We tend to exclude a pulsational pair-instability (PPISN) origin for SLSN 2021bnw. Instead we conclude that SLSN 2021bnw was preferably a core-collapse explosion of a star with the initial mass of not less than 61 Msun aided by magnetorotational effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertical Temperature Structure in Io's Atmosphere from ALMA SO$_2$ Observations</a><span class="id">[2602.15261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The structure of Io's atmosphere is controlled by competing processes, from volcanic outgassing and sublimation to radiative cooling and plasma heating. Yet, the lack of an observationally-derived temperature profile has left this balance unconstrained. We used four epochs of Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 7 (275-373 GHz) and Band 8 (385-500 GHz) SO$_2$ spectroscopy to retrieve Io's vertical atmospheric temperature profiles. To mitigate longstanding degeneracies common in atmospheric retrievals, we performed a simultaneous multi-line analysis combined with line-of-sight disk-resolved Doppler velocity maps and a forward model that included a sub-beam velocity-dispersion term. This modeling approach enabled the separation of thermal and dynamical line-shape contributions. On the leading hemisphere, we retrieved a cold, quasi-isothermal lower atmosphere ($\sim$124-137 K up to $\sim$0.5 nbar), followed by a thermospheric rise reaching hundreds of kelvins by $\sim10^{-2}$ nbar. On the trailing hemisphere, our fits yielded qualitatively similar profiles but consistently retrieved lower SO$_2$ column densities. The lower column densities confined line formation to the first few kilometers, making the trailing hemisphere spectra statistically consistent with an isothermal atmosphere. Across datasets, we retrieved fractional gas coverages of $\sim$35-50$\%$ and sub-beam velocity dispersions of $\sim$25-85$\mathrm{~m~s^{-1}}$, encoding line-of-sight velocity dispersion within a beam element in excess of the disk-resolved Doppler velocity map. Together, these retrievals deliver the first vertically resolved temperature profiles of Io's atmosphere, reveal robust vertical structure on the dayside leading hemisphere, and offer new constraints on Io's thermal energy balance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Arrival Infrasound from Meteoroids: Fragmentation Signatures versus Propagation Effects in a Fine-Scale Layered Atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2602.15262]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Infrasonic signatures of meteoroid fragmentation are frequently ambiguous: do multiple arrivals signify a complex breakup or merely the distorting effects of a layered atmosphere? Resolving this ambiguity is critical for accurate energy estimates and source reconstruction. In this study, we address this challenge by analyzing a unique regional dataset of well-constrained meteoroid events observed by the Southern Ontario Meteor Network and the co-located Elginfield Infrasound Array. We employ pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) simulations to quantify how fine-scale gravity-wave structures in the stratosphere and lower thermosphere modify acoustic waveforms at ranges &lt;300 km. Our modeling reveals that while fine-scale layering can stretch signals and generate diffuse oscillatory tails, it does not produce discrete, high-amplitude pulse splitting at ranges below  140 km. By applying these results to the rare multi-arrival event 20060305, we demonstrate that its distinct double arrival at 100 km range is inconsistent with atmospheric multipathing and provides definitive evidence of separate fragmentation episodes. These findings establish new diagnostic criteria for separating source physics from propagation artifacts, improving the reliability of infrasound as a monitoring tool for natural bolides, space debris re-entries, and catastrophic launch failures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Insights from Revisiting the Rotation Period of the Strongly Magnetic O Star, NGC 1624-2</a><span class="id">[2602.15321]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>NGC 1624-2 hosts the strongest surface magnetic field found on an O star thus far. When applied across several epochs of observations, the star's currently accepted rotation period (157.99 d) does not coherently characterize the variations of spectral lines of magnetospheric origin. We analyze Lomb-Scargle periodograms produced with new and archival, multi-instrument spectroscopic time series of Balmer H and He spectral lines. We find that 153.17 $\pm$ 0.42 d and 306.56 $\pm$ 1.19 d are both equally suitable periods at phasing the spectral and magnetic time series data in a manner consistent with the Oblique Rotator Model. The 306.56 d period implies a magnetic geometry for NGC 1624-2 that is quite different from the previously accepted one, for which both magnetic poles should be observed during a full rotational cycle. If this is the case, the star's magnetic South pole has yet to be observed, and additional spectropolarimetric observations should be acquired in order to confirm whether or not the south pole is in fact observable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the dynamics, thermodynamics and fine structure of virtual erupting filaments</a><span class="id">[2602.15401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is not fully understood why some solar filaments erupt while others do not. Those that do typically undergo a slow rise followed by an acceleration phase, though this transition requires further investigation. Erupting prominences have been observed to heat up during the acceleration phase, but the origin of this heating remains unclear. Moreover, some coronal mass ejections possess additional fine structure in white-light observations beyond the classical three-part morphology. We aim to elaborate on the dynamics of erupting prominences, investigate the heating during the acceleration phase, and correlate our findings with observations. We employ the open-source MPI-AMRVAC code to solve the 2.5D MHD equations on a coronal domain extending to 300 Mm, using adaptive mesh refinement to attain high resolution. Controlled combinations of footpoint shearing and converging motions applied to an initial magnetic arcade produce erupting flux ropes with self-consistent prominence and coronal rain formation due to thermal instability. We find both non-erupting and erupting cases related to the system energization. Comparison with observations from the AIA Filament Eruption Catalog shows that the slow-rise and impulsive phases are modulated by magnetic reconnection. The transition to acceleration corresponds to an increase in the inflow Alfvén Mach number. Thermal conduction and compressional heating can lead to prominence evaporation. We obtain nested circular fine structure in EUV images of the ejected flux ropes, partly resulting from plasmoid interactions. We conclude that internal heating processes and magnetic reconnection play key roles in the early evolution of CMEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Averaging in Nonminimally Coupled Gravity</a><span class="id">[2602.15448]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We address the challenge, commonly referred to as the cosmological averaging problem, of relating the large-scale evolution of an inhomogeneous Universe to that predicted by a homogeneous matter distribution in theories of gravity with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings. To this end, we focus on the class of $f(R,T)$ models defined by $f(R,T)=R+F(T)$, which provide a simple yet theoretically consistent realization of nonminimal matter-gravity interactions and can be reformulated as general relativity minimally coupled to a modified matter Lagrangian. Using nonstandard global monopole solutions as a toy model for realistic particles, we show that the spatial average of $F$ typically differs significantly from $F$ evaluated at the spatially averaged trace of $T$, implying that homogeneous cosmological models generally fail to capture the correct large-scale dynamics of the Universe. We further show that dust in these theories generally exhibits a non-vanishing proper pressure. Our results underscore the necessity of properly accounting for spatial averaging when modeling cosmology in theories with nonminimal matter-gravity couplings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Quantum Genetic Algorithm with application to Cosmological Parameters Estimation</a><span class="id">[2602.15459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>An Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Genetic Algorithm (AEQGA) has been developed to minimize $\chi^2$ functions of different cosmological probes (Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation), to find the best-fit value for two cosmological parameters, namely the Hubble Constant and the density matter content of the Universe today.

Recent modelling work leads us to expect that such heating mechanisms would be seen in the excess broadening (non-thermal velocity) of coronal spectral emission lines and that larger magnitudes of photospheric magnetic flux would generate more heating, but a direct connection between magnetic flux and spectral line broadening has been difficult to establish. We combine measurements of the photospheric magnetic field from SDO/HMI and non-thermal velocity in log T 6.2 coronal plasma from Hinode/EIS for 28 active regions and find a moderate correlation between the two exists in quiescent active regions, consistent with the photospheric field injecting upward Poynting flux into the solar corona and causing coronal heating.

In most cases the non-detections are due to the strong POLDs contamination or lack of observable lines in the ESPRESSO wavelength range, and so previous detections cannot be ruled out. Conclusions. Planet-occulted line-distortion contamination continues to be the main limitation of high-resolution transmission spectroscopy for species present in both the star and the planet, hindering atmospheric detections even with state-of-the-art models, in particular for planets with a low sky-projected spin-orbit angle. Developing advanced techniques to isolate planetary signatures is of utmost importance in the advent of ELT-like observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15507" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Upper atmosphere dynamics and drivers of volatiles loss from terrestrial-type (exo)planets</a><span class="id">[2602.15507]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Volatile loss from exoplanetary atmospheres and its possible implications for the longevity of habitable surface conditions is a topic of vigorous debate currently. The vast majority of the habitable zone terrestrial-like exoplanets known to date orbit low-mass M- and K-dwarf stars and are subject to the conditions drastically different to those of terrestrial planets in the Solar System. In particular, they orbit far closer to their host stars than similar planets around G-dwarfs similar to the Sun. Therefore they receive higher X-ray and UV fluxes, even though luminosities of M- and K-dwarfs are lower than those of heavier stars. Furthermore, due to their slower evolution, M-dwarfs retain high activity on the gigayear timescales. The combination of these two effects has led to claims that most terrestrial planets orbiting M-dwarfs may have their atmospheres stripped from the higher X-ray and UV fluxes of their host stars. Opposing this are researchers who point out that volatile inventories for terrestrial exoplanets are ill-constrained, and hence, they may be able to &quot;weather the storm&quot; of these higher X-ray and UV fluxes. In this chapter, we focus on exploring volatile loss in the upper atmospheres of terrestrial planets in our solar system and applications to those in exoplanetary systems around stars of different types.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic topology.

Detectability with non-standard primordial power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2602.15527]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Non-trivial spatial topology of the Universe can imprint potentially observable signatures on the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this study, we investigate how deviations from the standard nearly-scale-free primordial power spectrum impact observables for the fully compact, orientable Euclidean topologies ($E_1$–$E_6$). We examine how such deviations modify the detectability of the underlying topology, depending on whether they are an intrinsic consequence of non-trivial topology or independent of it. We compute CMB temperature correlation matrices across a range of topologies, fundamental domain sizes, and observer locations for both standard and modified primordial power spectra. The impact of these modifications on the detectability of topology is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence, providing an estimate of the distinguishability of non-trivial and simply-connected topologies based solely on CMB temperature observations. In addition, we employ the CatBoost machine learning algorithm to classify harmonic-space realizations of CMB temperature maps and thereby assess the observational prospects for topology detection. Signatures of non-trivial topology are encoded in the off-diagonal structure of the CMB temperature correlation matrices and are most prominent on the largest angular scales. Deviations from the simple power-law primordial spectrum at these scales can substantially alter the detectability of topology, either enhancing its characteristic CMB imprints or suppressing them below observational sensitivity. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in the primordial power spectrum must be carefully accounted for in robust searches for cosmic topology using the CMB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An observational test of the plasma lensing effect using QSOs with and without MgII absorption</a><span class="id">[2602.15558]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio wave propagation can be perturbed by compact ionized gas clumps through plasma lensing, which induces frequency dependent magnification and may distort the observed number counts of background sources. The quasar (QSO) number densities are a powerful probe for understanding the effects of intervening material. Absorption lines in QSO spectra reveal the presence of interstellar and intergalactic gas, which can change observed fluxes through dust extinction and plasma lensing. By combining observations from radio (VLASS), infrared (WISE), and optical bands (DESI), we assembled a sample of QSOs:  4000 sources with MgII absorbers, and  12, 000 non-absorbers. In the radio band, the MgII sample shows a moderate excess at the bright end of the flux distribution, which is broadly consistent with plasma lensing predications. In the optical, the MgII sample turns over at higher g-band fluxes and exhibits a steeper decline at the faint end than the non-MgII sample. Control samples were constructed by matching in redshift, infrared (W1), and optical (g) luminosities. In these comparisons, the radio excess becomes less prominent, suggesting that the apparent magnification may not be robust evidence for plasma lensing. Nevertheless, a weak contribution cannot be ruled out, especially given residual excess observed at the bright end relative to the non-MgII sample. Dust extinction along the line-of-sight remains a plausible alternative. Regardless of the dominant mechanism, the multi-wavelength differences offer a valuable probe of the physical state of the intervening medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inference of horizontal velocity fields from the induction equation in the solar atmosphere.

Analytical and numerical solutions in 2D</a><span class="id">[2602.15561]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observations, which rely on the Doppler effect, only provide access to the line-of-sight component of the solar plasma velocity (vz). However, many dynamic processes in the solar atmosphere involve strong horizontal motions (in the plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx, vy). Existing methods for estimating horizontal velocities are generally insensitive to variations in height (the z-coordinate), providing them only on a single plane perpendicular to the line-of-sight: vx(x,y), vy(x,y). Motivated by the fact that modern analysis techniques allow us to retrieve the height dependence of vz and B, our goal is to infer also this height dependence for the horizontal velocity field in the solar atmosphere. As a first step, we present, and test a method for the two-dimensional case on the (y,z) plane so as to show that the z dependence can be successfully retrieved. The components of the two-dimensional magnetic induction equation are discretized via finite differences, leading to an overdetermined system whose solution provides vy. The method assumes that B, its time variation, as well as vz are known. This is currently possible through modern Stokes inversion techniques applied to spatially and temporally resolved spectropolarimetric observations. Using analytically prescribed values and two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of the solar surface, we demonstrate that, in these idealized cases, the horizontal velocity component in a two-dimensional domain, can be successfully recovered with a mean error of about 1 %. The proposed method successfully retrieves the horizontal velocity field in the (y,z) plane, thereby establishing the foundation for future extensions to three-dimensional reconstructions of the horizontal velocity field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15590" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morphological variations of solar granules in the presence of magnetic fields</a><span class="id">[2602.15590]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar granulation consists of dynamic convective plasma cells that rise from the solar interior to the surface. The interaction between these plasma cells and the Sun's magnetic field provides valuable insights into plasma dynamics near the solar surface and how they evolve in the presence of magnetic fields. This study analyses the morphological characteristics of solar convective cells, investigating the relationship between magnetic field properties and granule dynamics - specifically how granule area, shape, and brightness vary under different magnetic field conditions. Observations of the active region NOAA 11768 were taken with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). A segmentation algorithm was applied to continuum intensity images to identify individual granules and determine their sizes, shapes, and mean brightness. The magnetic field vector and line-of-sight velocity were derived from CRISP spectropolarimetric data to investigate their role in shaping granule properties. We find that granular area decreases systematically with increasing magnetic field strength, with the largest granules occurring in non-magnetic regions and a mean granule area of approximately 1.58 arcsec$^2$ (effective diameter of 1.42 arcseconds). Both mean continuum intensity and granule size decrease with stronger fields, confirming the suppression of convective energy transport in magnetised regions. No correlation was found between mean granule brightness and mean up-flow velocity. Highly elongated granules appear in both magnetic and non-magnetic regions, while near-circular granules are exclusive to non-magnetic areas. An alignment between granule major axes and magnetic field azimuth is observed where the horizontal field component is strong, confirming that granules are highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which inhibit the lateral expansion of convective cells.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast computation of temperature and polarization coupling matrices</a><span class="id">[2602.15605]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a fast and exact method for computing CMB mode-coupling matrices based on an optimised evaluation of Wigner-3j symbols. The method exploits analytic structure in the relevant Wigner-3j symbol configurations appearing in temperature and polarization coupling matrices, expressing all required quantities in terms of a small set of recurrence-generated values which are precomputed and stored in lookup tables. This approach reduces the computational cost of constructing the full coupling matrices whilst maintaining numerical accuracy. We demonstrate the performance of the threej_cosmo implementation using realistic survey masks from current CMB experiments. Relative to standard recursion-based approaches used in existing pseudo-C_l pipelines, the method achieves speedups of 6-25x in practical coupling-matrix constructions, with the largest gains occurring at high multipoles. The algorithm admits efficient parallelisation on both CPUs and GPUs, the latter providing additional acceleration, up to a further order of 50 on modern hardware, without altering the underlying formalism. Beyond full matrix construction, the approach is naturally suited to applications in which only a restricted set of l3 modes is required for each (l1,l2) pair, such as in the computation of band-limited coupling matrices and analytic covariance terms. These features make threej_cosmo a practical backend for pseudo-C_l estimation and related calculations in next-generation CMB analysis pipelines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Axion-like particle Dark Matter with Time-domain Polarization: Constraints from a protoplanetary disk</a><span class="id">[2602.15611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axion-like particles (ALPs) can induce a birefringence effect that rotates the polarization angle of light, offering a probe of ultralight dark matter. We analyze archival near-infrared polarimetric data of the protoplanetary disk (PPD) around HD 163296. Whereas previous studies considered only single-epoch snapshots, we perform a consistent multi-epoch time-series analysis, extracting the polarization angle and its uncertainty from the polarized images. The resulting six-epoch time series is consistent with a constant polarization angle within the measurement uncertainties, while being sensitive to timescales of $\sim 170-400$ days. The typical polarization angle uncertainties are $1.6$–$6.4$ degrees, partly driven by multiple scattering in the optically thick disk, which broadens the intrinsic polarization angle distribution and introduces additional dispersion in the representative polarization angle. Based on these data, we derive the first upper limits on the ALP-photon coupling from PPD polarization variability, $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 7.5 \times 10^{-12} (m_a / 10^{-22}\,{\rm eV})\,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$.

These diagnostics have rarely been studied together during the modern era of high-resolution solar flare observations, and never at the spectral and spatial resolution of the DKIST. We directly compare DKIST spectra to state-of-the-art RADYN+RH simulations, including one heated by a nonthermal electron beam and one by in-situ thermal conduction. While certain salient properties of the spectra such as the width of H-epsilon are reproduced, the models severely underestimate the width of Ca II H in the red wing and fail to reproduce the exact relative intensity of Ca II H to H-epsilon. The models exhibit a range of condensation electron densities spanning over an order of magnitude. Unlike the modeled lower-order Balmer-series lines, we find that the width of H-epsilon is not solely related to the condensation properties; the widths and intensities are also sensitive to the deeper flare layers. We outline possible avenues towards improvement of flare models, such as a comprehensive evaluation of flare heating mechanisms in the context of both impulsive and decay phase high-resolution data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15688" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detecting the neutrino mass via the cross-correlation between matter tracers and the ISWRS effect?</a><span class="id">[2602.15688]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work explores the potential to detect the nonlinear Integrated Sachs Wolfe effect, namely the Rees-Sciama effect (ISWRS), by cross-correlating current and future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments – Simons Observatory, CMB-S4, CMB-HD, and PICO – with ongoing Large Scale Structure (LSS) surveys, such as Euclid and the Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST). We model the cross-correlation of the ISWRS effect with gravitational potential tracers like galaxy clustering, cosmic shear, and CMB-lensing potential, to forecast results from these experiments. Our analysis also accounts for the presence of massive neutrinos to assess the feasibility of identifying the $\nu$$\Lambda$CDM model and constraining the neutrino mass sum, M$\nu$. Our findings indicate that the CMB-lensing potential reconstructed by CMB-HD is expected to provide the most promising results, achieving $\gtrsim$ 5$\sigma$ detections even under conservative assumptions for detector noise and foregrounds, thereby allowing differentiation between $\nu$$\Lambda$CDM models. Galaxy clustering can also yield significant detections, whereas cosmic shear can provide valuable results only if non-linearities are accurately modelled, beyond the capabilities of currently available analytical approaches. These latter LSS probes do not provide strong constraining power on M$\nu$.

Intermediate He-rich subdwarfs are also He-MS stars, but of lower mass (0.55 Msun) than the extremely He-rich. This strongly supports the merger scenario for the origin of He-rich sdO stars, in which two helium white dwarfs merge following orbital decay driven by gravitational-wave emission, producing a He-rich sdO or sdOB star.

Although these modes are expected to be ubiquitous in stars with convective envelopes, Kepler observations reveal that a significant fraction of solar-like stars show no detectable acoustic modes, particularly among rapidly rotating and magnetically active stars. Recent theoretical work by Bessila et al. (2025) has proposed that rotation tends to inhibit convective motions, thereby reducing the power available for stochastic mode excitation. Here, we test this prediction using fully compressible hydrodynamical simulations of a solar-like star. We perform a series of 2.5D simulations, which consider longitudinal symmetry, using the MUSIC code spanning rotation rates from 0 to 8 $\Omega_{\odot}$. We find a clear and systematic decline of acoustic mode amplitudes with increasing rotation rate. In the most rapidly rotating models, mode damping rates are also enhanced. The combined reduction in excitation and increase in damping with increasing rotation rate provide a physical explanation for the observed decrease in mode detectability in rapidly rotating solar-like stars. Our results demonstrate that rotation can significantly modify oscillation properties and must be accounted for when interpreting asteroseismic observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model selection with the Pantheon+ Type Ia SN sample</a><span class="id">[2602.15047]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent discoveries, e.g., by JWST and DESI, have elevated the level of tension with inflationary $\Lambda$CDM.

In this Letter, we use a recently compiled Type Ia supernova sample to examine whether $\Lambda$CDM violates the energy conditions in the local Universe, and carry out model selection with its principal competitor, the $R_{\rm h}=ct$ universe. We derive model-independent constraints on the distance modulus based on the energy conditions and compare these with the Hubble diagram predicted by both $\Lambda$CDM and $R_{\rm h}=ct$, using the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova catalog.

In this work, we investigate gravitational wave production from primordial black holes whose evaporation is thermally influenced by their surrounding environment. We adopt a thermal evaporation framework in which interactions with the ambient plasma modify the effective decay rate of the black hole, leading to enhanced mass loss at early times and a redistribution of the evaporation history compared to the standard non-thermal vacuum case. Since graviton emission is intrinsically tied to the evaporation history of PBHs, these thermal effects play a crucial role in determining the timing and spectral properties of the resulting stochastic gravitational wave background.

We first study the motion of neutral test particles and derive the fundamental orbital and epicyclic frequencies, which are then employed to analyze different quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) models. Using observational QPO data from stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive black hole candidates, we perform a Bayesian parameter estimation through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis and obtain constraints on the black hole parameters. The results show that the presence of the quantum correction significantly affects the location of the QPO radii and the separation between the QPO orbit and the ISCO. We then examine the scalar perturbations by deriving the Schrödinger-like radial equation and the corresponding effective potential. The influence of the parameters $Q$ and $\zeta$ on the perturbation potential and stability of the spacetime is discussed. Furthermore, we compute the greybody factor and the energy emission rate in the high-frequency (geometric-optics) regime, showing how the quantum correction modifies the absorption probability and radiation spectrum. Finally, we study the effect of thermal fluctuations on the black hole entropy and obtain the logarithmic corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking area law. We show that these corrections become important for small black holes, while for large horizon radius the standard thermodynamic behavior is recovered. Our analysis demonstrates that the quantum correction parameter leaves observable imprints on both dynamical and thermodynamical properties of the spacetime and can be constrained through QPO observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radial oscillations of pulsating neutron stars: The UCIa equation-of-state case</a><span class="id">[2602.15818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radial oscillations provide a clean dynamical test of the high-density stiffness of neutron-star equations of state.

We then derive and solve the linear general-relativistic radial pulsation equations to compute the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the fundamental and overtone modes. The $\sigma$-cutoff suppresses the growth of the scalar field at supranuclear density, increases the pressure, and shifts the maximum mass, radii, and $\Lambda_{1.4}$ accordingly, while systematically raising the radial-mode frequencies at fixed mass. Using the sign change of $\omega_0^2$ as a stability criterion, we identify stiffened models that remain radially stable up to the observed $\sim 2M_\odot$ mass scale and are consistent with current multimessenger constraints, demonstrating how radial spectra complement static EoS tests.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubble-Scale Tachyonic Shocks from Low-Scale Inflation – A New Gravitational-Wave Window on Inflation</a><span class="id">[2602.15825]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current bounds on the tensor-to-scalar ratio imply that the energy scale of inflation may lie below the grand-unified scale. In this paper, we show that in a broad class of single-field inflation models with sufficiently small energy scales, an extremely efficient tachyonic instability develops at the end of inflation. This instability rapidly drives the system into a nonlinear regime before coherent oscillations can be established, leading to a first-order phase-transition–like phenomenon without tunneling or barrier crossing. The resulting ultra-relativistic shock fronts surrounding the bubble interiors expand to near the Hubble scale, corresponding to the most strongly enhanced tachyonic modes, and collide with one another, producing energetic inflaton particles and gravitational waves. As a result, the post-inflationary dynamics can differ significantly from the conventional high-scale inflationary scenario. Interestingly, inflation at MeV–EeV energy scales can be probed via gravitational-wave observations, including pulsar timing arrays, ground-based detectors, and future space-based experiments. Recent limits from the LIGO–KAGRA–Virgo collaboration already constrain EeV-scale inflation, while pulsar timing array results may be interpreted as evidence for gravitational waves generated by GeV-scale inflation. We also briefly discuss further implications of the resulting tachyonic shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13160" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing neutrino emission at GeV energies from compact binary mergers with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a><span class="id">[2105.13160]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The advent of multi-messenger astronomy has allowed for new types of source searches by neutrino detectors.

For the 372 delta Scuti stars, we provide a catalogue of the period and amplitude of the dominant pulsation mode.

This second ridge is seen more clearly than before, thanks to the revised periods and distances. We demonstrate the value of the period-luminosity diagram in distinguishing delta Scuti stars from short-period RR Lyrae stars, and we find several new examples of high-frequency delta Scuti stars with regular sequences of overtone modes, including XX Pyx and 29 Cyg.

Based on the Fourier amplitude spectra, we identify 848 delta Scuti stars, as well as 47 eclipsing or contact binaries. The strongest pulsation modes of some delta Scuti stars fall on the period-luminosity relation of the fundamental radial mode but many correspond to overtones that are approximately a factor of two higher in frequency. Many of the low-luminosity delta Scuti stars show a series of high-frequency modes with very regular spacings. The fraction of stars in our sample that show delta Scuti pulsations is about 70% for the brightest stars (G&lt;8), consistent with results from Kepler. However, the fraction drops to about 45% for fainter stars and we find that a single sector of TESS data only detects the lowest-amplitude delta Scuti pulsations (around 50 ppm) in stars down to about G=9. Finally, we have found four new high-frequency delta Scuti stars with very regular mode patterns, and have detected pulsations in lambda Mus that make it the fourth-brightest delta Scuti in the sky (G=3.63).

However, numerical computation of the GW signal from cosmic strings requires the evaluation of complicated integral and sum expressions, which can become computationally costly in large parameter scans. This motivates us to rederive the GW signal from a network of local stable cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto approximation and based on the velocity-dependent one-scale model from a “pedestrian” perspective. That is, we derive purely analytical expressions for the total GW spectrum, which remain exact wherever possible and whose error can be tracked and reduced in a controlled way in crucial situations in which we are forced to introduce approximations. In this way, we obtain powerful formulas that, unlike existing results in the literature, are valid across the entire frequency spectrum and across the entire conceivable range of cosmic-string tensions. We provide an in-depth discussion of the GW spectra thus obtained, including their characteristic break frequencies and approximate power-law behaviors, comment on the effect of changes in the effective number of degrees of freedom during radiation domination, and conclude with a concise summary of our main formulas that can readily be used in future studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07469" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</a><span class="id">[2503.07469]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $Ł$CDM model and its modification.

While magnetars are a leading candidate for those sources that appear isolated, several observational properties challenge the established evolutionary framework: (i) low quiescent X-ray luminosities, (ii) $\sim$hour-long rotational periods, and (iii) highly-variable radio flux. It is shown via magnetothermal modelling that, if electric currents thread the fluid core at the time of crust freezing, the neutron star remains multiband silent for an initial period of approximately 0.1 Myr while cooling passively. Once the crust becomes cold enough, the Hall effect begins to dominate the magnetic evolution, triggering crustal failures that inject magnetospheric twist that initiates radio pulsing while depleting rotational kinetic energy from an already-slow star. Depending on where electric currents circulate, such 'late-blooming' magnetars manifesting as long-period transients may thus form a distinct branch from soft gamma repeaters and anomalous X-ray pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Single-Degenerate Channel Leads to Type Iax and Not Type Ia Supernovae due to Premature Ignition</a><span class="id">[2507.16907]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are a critical tool for cosmology and galactic enrichment, yet the progenitor systems of normal SNe Ia remain a central puzzle.

Here, we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations that resolve these tensions by showing a fundamental dichotomy: accreting WDs predominantly ignite prematurely at sub-Chandrasekhar masses, producing low-energy, incomplete explosions consistent with Type Iax supernovae. Only WDs reaching a narrow mass threshold of 1.37 solar mass undergo complete destruction, characteristic of normal SNe Ia. This &quot;safety valve&quot; mechanism effectively recasts the SD channel as the main pathway to SNe Iax, not normal SNe Ia, providing a unified explanation for the observed scarcity of progenitor signatures in the latter and suggesting alternative channels dominate normal SNe Ia production.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing bright $δ$ Scuti pulsators using TESS lightcurves</a><span class="id">[2508.18589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of bright, young $\delta$ Scuti stars near the zero-age main sequence using TESS light curves and Gaia DR3 data.

EDOs are energetic outflows produced during dynamical interactions in young, massive star-forming regions, and their physical conditions make them promising environments for cosmic-ray acceleration. Using 16 years of $0.2$–$500$ GeV Fermi-LAT observations, we study the gamma-ray properties of seven EDOs. Three EDOs, DR21, G34.26$+$0.15, and G5.89$-$0.39 show spatially coincident GeV emission, while the remaining systems yield non-detections. Among the sample, DR21 stands out as the brightest candidate, with a detection significance $\geq 40\sigma$. Its spectrum is well described by a power law with an exponential cutoff, and the integrated luminosity in the $0.1$–$500$ GeV band is $L_\gamma \simeq 2\times10^{35}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}}$. When compared with the outflow's estimated kinetic energy, the inferred cosmic-ray acceleration efficiency is $\leq 18\%$, consistent with values for shocks in dense molecular environments. The energetics and morphology support an association between the DR21 molecular outflow and the observed gamma rays. Our results demonstrate that EDOs span a wide range of gamma-ray luminosities and efficiencies, suggesting they may contribute to the Galactic cosmic ray budget. This motivates searches for additional EDOs and improved multiwavelength characterization of their environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Supernova Project: Fast-Declining Type Ia Supernovae as Cosmological Distance Indicators</a><span class="id">[2509.07093]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, the suitability of fast-declining Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) as cosmological standard candles is examined utilizing a Hubble Flow sample of 43 of these objects observed by the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP). We confirm previous suggestions that fast-declining SNe Ia offer a viable method for estimating distances to early-type galaxies when the color-stretch parameter, $s_{BV}$, is used as a measure of the light curve shape. As a test, we employ the Tripp method, which models the absolute magnitude at maximum as a function of light curve shape and color. We calibrate the sample using 12 distance moduli based on published Infrared Surface Brightness Fluctuations to derive a value of the Hubble constant that is in close agreement with the value obtained for the full sample of CSP SNe Ia using the same methodology. We also develop a new and simple method of estimating the distances of fast decliners based only on their colors at maximum (and not light curve shape) and find that it leads to similar results as with using the Tripp method. This &quot;Color&quot; technique is a powerful tool that is unique to fast-declining SNe Ia. We show that the colors of the fast decliners at maximum light are strongly affected by photospheric temperature differences and not solely due to dust extinction, and provide a physical rationale for this effect.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond CPL: Evidence for dynamical dark energy in three-parameter models</a><span class="id">[2510.03779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce two three-parameter extensions of the minimal Akhtar-Hossain (mAH) dark energy parametrization, termed modified minimal AH (MmAH1 and MmAH2), which provide a smooth and bounded evolution of the dark energy equation of state while retaining $\Lambda$CDM as a limiting case.

However, the $D_H/r_d$ ratio shows a decreasing trend with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ at $2.3 \sigma$ to $2.5 \sigma$ that cannot be explained by physics. We demonstrate that the result does not depend on the choice of late Universe cosmological model, but the radius of the sound horizon $r_d$ has a much greater influence. Studying ratios of $D_H/r_d$ is a stronger test than the distance duality relation, and the rejection of a horizontal confirms systematics in either DESI BAO or DES SNe.

Although core collapse supernovae of isolated massive stars are important, binary interactions – such as tidal interaction, common envelope evolution, and stellar mergers – may also play a significant role in making magnetars. Understanding the relative contributions of these channels is crucial for linking magnetars to their observed properties and host environments. In this paper, we investigate potential magnetar formation channels using population synthesis simulations, considering both single-star and isolated binary system evolution. By conducting simulations with different parameters, we compare the effects of various evolution processes on magnetar formation. Additionally, we study the delay times and kick velocities across all formation channels, analyze the orbital properties and companion types of surviving magnetar binaries. We find that the majority of magnetars are observed as single objects ($\geq 90\%$), although a large fraction of them were originally in binary systems and experienced either kick disruption or merger. Surviving binaries are most likely to host main-sequence companions and exhibit different distributions of eccentricities due to different supernova mechanisms. These findings show the critical role of binary evolution in magnetar formation and provide predictions for the properties of magnetar populations that can be tested with future observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchrotron radiation from NGC 470 HLX1 - a hidden hyperluminous accreting neutron star?</a><span class="id">[2511.10183]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first broadband spectral analysis of NGC 470 HLX1, a hyperluminous X-ray source that exhibits significant flux variability over different epochs.

We obtained 150-200 spectra of each system over two orbits, split between the G235M and G395M gratings. All three systems show strong, double-peaked He I emission lines dominated by an accretion disk. These lines are nearly stationary but contain radial velocity (RV) variable sub-components that trace stream-disk interactions. In Gaia14aae and SRGeJ0453, we detect two Na I doublets in emission whose RVs track the irradiated face of the donor, marking the first direct detection of the donors of long-period AM CVns. No absorption lines from the donors are detected, implying that the IR excesses observed in many long-period AM CVns primarily trace disks, not donors. The He I emission profiles in all systems lack high-velocity wings and show no emission beyond $\approx 1500,\rm km,s^{-1}$. The morphology of the disk eclipses and Doppler tomograms are best reproduced by models in which the disk is truncated well outside the white dwarf and only material at $r \gtrsim 0.07,R_{\odot}$ contributes to the disk emission. We interpret this as possible evidence of magnetized white dwarf accretors. For plausible mass transfer rates, the truncation radii imply surface magnetic fields of $B = 30-100$ kG, consistent with recent constraints based on X-ray periodicity. The absence of cyclotron humps out to 5 $\mu$m rules out stronger MG-level fields.

RICH is a semi-Lagrangian code that solves the equations of RHD on an unstructured moving mesh, and is the first multigroup RHD moving mesh code, making it uniquely applicable to problems with extreme dynamic range and dynamically important radiation forces. We validate our multigroup module against multiple analytic benchmarks, including a novel test of the RHD Doppler term.

Optical afterglows, though short-lived and challenging to observe, may be significantly enhanced in dense environments, potentially making them detectable with facilities like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). In contrast, X-ray afterglows are predicted to be too faint for detection with current instruments. Our study highlights the potential of multi-wavelength afterglows as probes of FRB progenitors and their surrounding environments, offering crucial insights into the nature of these mysterious transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamics of the coronal magnetic field in the 2022-10-02 X-class flare</a><span class="id">[2602.05024]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares are driven by release of free magnetic energy and often associated with restructurization of the magnetic field topology. Yet, observations of evolving magnetic field in the flaring volume are limited to very few cases including the 2017-09-10 X8.2 limb flare; thus, a verification of whether a similar evolution takes place in other solar flares is needed. Here we report one more, 2022-10-02, X1.1 class solar flare but seen on disk, whose microwave data permit mapping the magnetic field over the flaring source and tracking magnetic field evolution over the course of the flare. We found that the coronal magnetic field shows a prominent decay with the rate up to 10 G s$^{-1}$ in several (above) loop-top locations. The magnetic field is also confidently measured at the loop legs and the bottom part of the erupting filament. Prominent acceleration of electrons is detected where the magnetic field decays. We developed 3D models of the flare, whose magnetic field shows resemblance and also deviation from the magnetic field inferred from the microwave data. This study confirms that the coronal magnetic field decays during the rise phase of the solar flare. The amount of released magnetic energy is sufficient to support other components of the flare energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is cosmic birefringence due to dark energy or dark matter? Simulation-based inference</a><span class="id">[2602.12019]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a powerful inference technique for cases where the exact functional form of the likelihood is not known. A prime example is the likelihood of cross-correlation power spectra of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fields at low multipoles, $\ell\lesssim 10$. In this paper, we investigate a parity-violating cross-correlation between $E$- and $B$- mode polarization fields using SBI. The $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ is essential to distinguish between possible axion dark energy and dark matter interpretations of `cosmic birefringence', a rotation of the plane of linear polarization of the CMB, recently reported from WMAP, Planck, and Atacama Cosmology Telescope data. We use neural likelihood estimation to infer the likelihood of the $EB$ correlation at low $\ell$ and show that it is highly non-Gaussian. We then employ neural posterior estimation to constrain the scalar field mass ($m_\phi$), the cosmic birefringence amplitude ($g\phi_\mathrm{in}/2$), and the instrumental miscalibration angle ($\alpha$), from simulated datasets. We find that the posterior on $m_{\phi}$ shows two regimes, with a transition marked by $10^{-32}$ eV, highlighting a strong sensitivity to the scale dependence of cosmic birefringence. To quantify this behavior, we compute the probability $p(m_{\phi} &lt; 10^{-32}$ eV) for various fiducial values of $m_{\phi}$. We find that $\alpha$ and the contribution of lensed $B$ modes ultimately limit our ability to exclude the dark energy scenario fully.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microphysical Model of Jupiter's Great Red Spot Upper Chromophore Haze</a><span class="id">[2602.14911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of the red colouration in Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) is a long-standing question in planetary science. While several candidate chromophores have been proposed, no clear conclusions have been reached regarding its nature, evolution, or relationship to atmospheric dynamics. In this work, we perform microphysical simulations of the reddish haze over the GRS and quantify the production rates and timescales required to sustain it. Matching the previously reported chromophore column mass and effective radius in the GRS requires column-integrated injection fluxes in the range $1\times10^{-12}$-$7\times10^{-12}$ kg m$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, under low upwelling velocities in the upper troposphere ($v_{\mathrm{trop}}\lesssim 1.5\times10^{-4}$ m s$^{-1}$) and particle charges of at least 20 electrons per $\mu$m. Such rates exceed the mass flux that standard photochemical models of Jupiter currently supply via NH$_3$-C$_2$H$_2$ photochemistry at 0.1-0.2 bar, the most popular chromophore pathway in recent literature. We find a lower limit of 7 years on the haze formation time. We also assess commonly used size and vertical distribution parameterisations for the chromophore haze, finding that eddy diffusion prevents the long-term confinement of a thin layer and that the extinction is dominated by particles that can be represented by a single log-normal size distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deflection angle in the strong deflection limit: A perspective from local geometrical invariants and matter distributions</a><span class="id">[2503.02320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In static, spherically symmetric spacetimes, the deflection angle of photons in the strong deflection limit exhibits a logarithmic divergence. We introduce an analytical framework that clarifies the physical origin of this divergence by employing local, coordinate-invariant geometric quantities alongside the properties of the matter distribution. In contrast to conventional formulations – where the divergence rate $\bar{a}$ is expressed via coordinate-dependent metric functions – our approach relates $\bar{a}$ to the components of the Einstein tensor in an orthonormal basis adapted to the spacetime symmetry. By applying the Einstein equations, we derive the expression \begin{align*} \bar{a}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-8\pi R_{\mathrm{m}}^2\left(\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}\right)}}, \end{align*} where $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}$ denote the local energy density and tangential pressure evaluated at the photon sphere of areal radius $R_{\mathrm{m}}$. This result reveals that $\bar{a}$ is intrinsically governed by the local matter distribution, with the universal value $\bar{a}=1$ emerging when $\rho_{\mathrm{m}}+\Pi_{\mathrm{m}}=0$. Notably, this finding resolves the long-standing puzzle of obtaining $\bar{a}=1$ in a class of spacetimes supported by a massless scalar field. Furthermore, these local properties are reflected in the frequencies of quasinormal modes, suggesting a profound connection between strong gravitational lensing and the dynamical response of gravitational wave signals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22722" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explaining the PeV Neutrino Fluxes at KM3NeT and IceCube with Quasi-Extremal Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2505.22722]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The KM3NeT experiment has recently observed a neutrino with an energy around 100PeV, and IceCube has detected five neutrinos with energies above 1PeV. While there are no known astrophysical sources, exploding primordial black holes could have produced these high-energy neutrinos. For Schwarzschild black holes this interpretation results in tensions between the burst rates inferred from the KM3NeT and IceCube observations, with indirect constraints from the extragalactic gamma ray background and with the non-observation of an associated gamma ray signal at LHAASO. In this letter we show that if there is a population of primordial black holes charged under a new dark $u(1)$ symmetry which spend most of their time in a quasi-extremal state, the neutrino emission at 1PeV may be more suppressed than at 100PeV. The burst rates implied by the KM3NeT and IceCube observations and the indirect constraints can then all be consistent at $1\sigma$, and no associated gamma-ray signal was expected at LHAASO. Furthermore, these black holes could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secluded Dark Composites and Remnant Binding Fields</a><span class="id">[2506.04331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter may freeze-out and undergo composite assembly while decoupled from the Standard Model. In this secluded composite scenario, while individual dark matter particles may be too weakly-coupled to detect, the assembled composite can potentially be detected since its effective coupling scales with number of constituents. We examine models and observables for secluded composites, and in particular we investigate the cosmological abundance of the composite binding field, which is generated during freeze-out annihilation and secluded composite assembly. This binding field could be discovered as a new relativistic species in the early universe or through later interactions as a subdominant dark component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Real WIMPs with CTAO</a><span class="id">[2507.15937]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14795" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonstrange and strange quark matter at finite temperature within modified NJL model and protoquark stars</a><span class="id">[2508.14795]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend the modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model – incorporating exchange interactions via the Fierz transformation – to finite temperatures in both two- and three-flavor scenarios, and investigate the properties of protoquark stars in $\beta$-equilibrium. Our results show that increasing the strength of exchange interactions, characterized by the parameter $\alpha$, changes the chiral phase transition from first-order to crossover. We examine the effects of finite temperature, lepton fraction, and exchange interactions on the equation of state (EOS). We find that, in the crossover regime, the EOS is significantly stiffer than in the first-order case due to the substantial contribution of repulsive interactions in the exchange channels, while it remains relatively insensitive to variations in temperature and lepton fraction. Imposing the thermodynamic consistency, which requires the minimum of free energy per baryon $f / \rho_B$ occurs at zero pressure, further constrains the minimum value of vacuum pressure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multibanded Reduced Order Quadrature Techniques for Gravitational Wave Inference</a><span class="id">[2601.09819]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Reduced-order quadrature (ROQ) is commonly used to accelerate parameter estimation in gravitational wave astronomy; however, constructing ROQ bases can be computationally costly, particularly for longer-duration signals. We propose a modified construction strategy based on PyROQ that accelerates this process by performing the basis search using multiband waveforms, without compromising the desired likelihood accuracy. We use this altered method to construct a set of ROQs in the sub-solar mass (SSM) range using the IMRPhenomXAS_NRTidalV3 waveform. Compared to PyROQ's standard ROQ method, we find a decrease in basis size of 20% to 30% and observe a decrease in basis construction time by 5 to 20 times, reducing from two weeks to a couple of days. We verify the bases built with this method by injecting simulated gravitational waves into LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA design noise and recovering the parameters, and we find that they preserve the likelihood accuracy and maintain consistent parameter estimation results.</p></div></details></article></body>
