Mass measurements for these planets would be invaluable, but radial velocity surveys of young systems are often overwhelmed by stellar activity. Transit timing variations (TTVs) offer an alternative route to measure masses that are less impacted by signals from the host star. Here we search for candidate TTVs in a sample of 39 young systems hosting 53 transiting planets using data from Kepler, K2, and TESS. We recover previously reported TTVs for 11 planets, including those in V1298 Tau, TOI-2076, Kepler-51, and TOI-1227, and identify new candidate TTVs for four planets (DS Tuc Ab, HD 63433b, K2-101b, and Kepler-1643b). In total, 28.3 +/- 6.2% of young planets in our sample show evidence of TTVs, which is higher than the rate from Kepler on mostly older systems (7.3 +/- 0.6%). Accounting for differences in data coverage and quality between Kepler and TESS only increases this difference (&gt; 4$\sigma$), although differences in methodology make a totally fair comparison challenging. We show that spots have a weak-to-negligible impact on our results, and similarly cannot explain the higher TTV fraction. Longer-term monitoring will be required to validate these TTVs as planetary in nature and confirm the high TTV rate. While the candidate TTV signals detected here are sparsely sampled, our work provides a clear priority list for additional ground-based observations, and for multi-planet TTVs, attempt to measure the masses and eccentricities of these planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06066" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing the accelerating wind in the inner region of the colliding-wind binary WR 112</a><span class="id">[2512.06066]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Colliding winds in massive binaries generate X-ray-bright shocks, synchrotron radio emission, and sometimes even dusty &quot;pinwheel&quot; spirals. We report the first X-ray detections of the dusty WC+O binary system WR 112 from Chandra and Swift, alongside 27 years of VLA/ATCA radio monitoring and new diffraction-limited Keck images. Because we view the nearly circular orbit almost edge-on, the colliding-wind zone alternates between heavy Wolf-Rayet wind self-absorption and a near-transparent O-star wind foreground each 20-yr orbit, producing phase-locked radio and X-ray variability. This scenario leads to a prediction that the radio spectral index is flatter from a larger non-thermal contribution around the radio intensity maximum, which is indeed observed. Existing models that assume a single dust-expansion speed fail to reproduce the combined infrared geometry and radio light curve. Instead, we require an accelerating post-shock flow that climbs from near-stationary to  1350 km/s in about one orbital cycle, naturally matching the infrared spiral from about 5&quot; down to within 0.1&quot;, while also fitting the phase of the radio brightening. These kinematic constraints supply critical boundary conditions for future hydrodynamic simulations, which can link hot-plasma cooling, non-thermal radio emission, X-ray spectra, and dust formation in a self-consistent framework. WR 112 thus joins WR 140, WR 104, and WR 70-16 (Apep) as a benchmark system for testing colliding-wind physics under an increasingly diverse range of orbital architectures and physical conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Ancient Brown Dwarf Transiting a Metal-Poor Thick Disk Star</a><span class="id">[2512.06069]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of TOI-7019b, the first transiting brown dwarf (BD) known to orbit a star that is part of the Milky Way's ancient thick disk, as defined chemically ([Fe/H] $= -0.79 \pm 0.05$ dex, [$\alpha$/Fe] $= +0.26 \pm 0.05$ dex, [M/H] $= -0.59 \pm 0.06$ dex) and kinematically ($v_{\perp} \approx 150 \pm 1$ km s$^{-1}$). We estimate a system age $\tau = 12 \pm 2$ Gyr by fitting the host star's spectrum and spectral energy distribution to alpha-enhanced isochrones, and independently using the age-metallicity relation of the thick disk. This makes TOI-7019 by far the most metal-poor and ancient BD host known to date. We measure a BD mass of $61.3 \pm 2.1$ $M_{\rm J}$ and radius of $0.82 \pm 0.02$ $R_{\rm J}$ from a joint analysis of transit photometry and radial velocity measurements, along with an orbital period of $48.2592 \pm 0.0001$ days and an orbital eccentricity of $0.403 \pm 0.002$. The measured radius appears $12.3\% \pm 2.8\%$ larger than predicted relative to standard evolutionary models for old, metal-poor brown dwarfs, hinting at missing physics like the magnetic inhibition of convection. TOI-7019b lowers the probed metallicity regime for transiting BDs by over a factor of two, making it a benchmark system to test evolutionary models in the low-metallicity regime. Future measurements of TOI-7019b's atmosphere will test whether a brown dwarf's atmospheric composition tracks its host star's abundances, as expected for binary-like co-formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06083" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Test of Substellar Evolutionary Models with High-Precision Ages from Asteroseismology and Gyrochronology for the Benchmark System HR 7672AB</a><span class="id">[2512.06083]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-precision measurements for HR 7672AB, composed of a Sun-like (G0V) star and an L dwarf companion. Three nights of precise (70 cm/s) radial velocity (RV) asteroseismology with the Keck Planet Finder clearly detect 5-minute oscillations from the primary HR 7672A, and modeling of the frequency spectrum yields an asteroseismic age of $1.87\pm0.65$ Gyr. We also determine a gyrochronological age of $2.58\pm0.47$ Gyr, and we combine these two results for a final age of $2.26\pm0.40$ Gyr. In addition, we obtained new RVs for HR 7672A and new astrometry for the companion HR 7672B. From a joint orbit fit, we measured a dynamical mass of $1.111\pm0.017$ $M_\odot$ for HR 7672A and $75.39\pm0.67$ $M_{\rm Jup}$ for HR 7672B. This places the companion near the stellar/substellar boundary and thus particularly sensitive to differences in model predictions. The joint precision in host star age (18\% uncertainty) and companion mass (0.9\% uncertainty) makes HR 7672AB an exceptional substellar benchmark. Combined with the companion's luminosity, we use these measurements to test predictions from six brown dwarf cooling models. The best agreement occurs with the Chabrier et al. (2023) models, which incorporate a new equation of state, resulting in predictions that agree within $&lt;$0.3$\sigma$ with all the observations. The other 5 sets of models agree at the 1–3$\sigma$ level depending on the particular test, and some models struggle to predict a sufficient low luminosity for HR 7672B at any age given its dynamical mass. Finally, we detected a weak seismic signal in near-simultaneous TESS photometry of HR 7672A, with the resulting RV-to-photometry oscillation amplitude ratio consistent with solar values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha intensity mapping of cosmic reionization</a><span class="id">[2512.06085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) has garnered attention as a powerful cosmological probe, with next-generation instruments such as SPHEREx preparing to map the evolution of large-scale structure during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Lyman-alpha emission in the EoR is strongly shaped by resonant absorption from neutral hydrogen in the diffuse intergalactic medium (IGM), which transforms galactic sources into a low surface-brightness background. In this work, we leverage the state-of-the-art THESAN cosmological simulations to produce high-resolution theoretical predictions for future Lyman-alpha LIM studies, constructing continuous light cones for line-of-sight cosmological integrations. We assess the contributions of recombination, collisional excitation, and unresolved HII regions to the total Lyman-alpha spectral intensity. In addition, we explore the IGM in absorption at different redshifts using damping wing analysis. We produce channel maps exploring spatial fluctuations across redshift bands probe-able by LIM instruments. We find that the slope of the absorption-included Lyman-alpha fluctuation power spectrum at smaller scales (k &gt; 10^(-2) 1/arcsec) steepens toward lower redshift, and that our emission-only Lyman-alpha power spectrum lies above the SPHEREx sensitivity, whereas the absorption-included signal is  4 orders of magnitude lower–providing a conservative lower limit on inhomogeneity signatures and highlighting the importance of including resonant scattering in our model in the future. We also find that including outflows in a simple toy model boosts power by four orders of magnitude. We identify limitations in our analysis and propose next steps, including incorporating the effects of resonant Lyman-alpha scattering and line interlopers, as well as larger simulation volumes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of cold giant planets around late M dwarfs via core accretion and the fate of inner rocky worlds</a><span class="id">[2512.06115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modeling the formation of cold giant planets around M dwarfs is difficult because their disks may not contain enough solids to form massive cores and because forming giants are expected to migrate inward through disk interactions. It is also unclear whether inner rocky planets can survive in systems hosting a cold giant, with implications for the habitability of close-in worlds. We investigated the conditions that allow giant planets to form at 1-3 au around a 0.1 M$_\odot$ star and explored when a close-in rocky planet can survive. We perform N-body simulations in which embryos grow through pebble and gas accretion in a disk with a local turbulent viscosity of $\alpha_t = 10^{-4}$. Planet-disk interactions are included using a prescription that triggers outward migration when the planet-to-star mass ratio ($q$) exceeds 0.002. We find that a cold giant can form even in a disk with an initial pebble mass of 6 M$_\oplus$ if the disk gas mass is 10$\%$ of the stellar mass. This requires a compact 20 au disk with a dense inner region set by $\alpha_g = 10^{-4}$, the assembly of a $\sim$5 M$_\oplus$ core within 1 Myr, and a disk lifetime of 10 Myr. A close-in rocky planet can survive if it reaches the inner cavity before the outer body becomes a giant. Thus, giant planet formation around very low-mass stars does not require high dust masses as previously thought. A combination of planet-planet collisions, efficient pebble accretion, and a long disk lifetime plays a key role in enabling the formation of cold giant planets with masses between those of Saturn and Jupiter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Exoplanet Dynamics with JWST: Tides, Rotation, Rings, and Moons</a><span class="id">[2512.06120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although nearly 6,000 exoplanets are currently known, in most cases our knowledge is limited to a handful of the planet's orbital characteristics and bulk properties such as radius and mass. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) can expand our knowledge not only by probing exoplanet atmospheres, but also by measuring additional orbital and physical properties of exoplanets, thanks to its superior light-gathering power and measurement precision. Here, we describe the potential of JWST to unveil dynamical phenomena that were previously beyond our reach, such as tidal distortion and inflation, rotational flattening, planetary rings, and moons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06138" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS): X-ray stacking analysis of Subaru's optically selected clusters spanning low richness regime</a><span class="id">[2512.06138]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is the second paper in a series exploring the X-ray properties of galaxy clusters optically selected by the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey, using data from the SRG/eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS). We aim to investigate scaling relations between observable cluster properties and mass, and to study the radial X-ray profiles of a large sample of optically selected clusters. We analyze a sample of 997 CAMIRA clusters with richness $N &gt; 15$ and redshifts of $0.1 &lt; z &lt; 1.3$. Using bolometric luminosities derived from count rates and a weak-lensing mass calibration, we study the $L-M$ and $N-M$ scaling relations through stacking analysis, while accounting for selection effects and redshift evolution. We also compare clusters with and without X-ray counterparts in the eFEDS catalog in terms of their scaling relations and surface brightness profiles. The best-fit $L-M$ slope ($1.56^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$) is slightly steeper than the self-similar prediction, yet remains consistent with our previous findings. The $N-M$ slope ($0.766^{+0.070}_{-0.060}$) broadly agrees with theoretical expectations and other optical samples. The data do not require any additional redshift evolution beyond the standard self-similar scaling, although current constraints on evolution remain weak. X-ray detected clusters exhibit a steeper $L-M$ slope, higher central surface brightness, and more centrally concentrated X-ray profiles than undetected systems. Our results highlight systematic differences in the X-ray properties between optically and X-ray selected cluster samples. This study extends scaling relation analyses into lower mass and luminosity regimes, demonstrating the value of combining deep X-ray and optical surveys like eROSITA and Subaru HSC.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Fully Photometric Approach to Type Ia Supernova Cosmology in the LSST Era: Host Galaxy Redshifts and Supernova Classification</a><span class="id">[2512.06319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to discover nearly a million Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa), offering an unprecedented opportunity to constrain dark energy. The vast majority of these events will lack spectroscopic classification and redshifts, necessitating a fully photometric approach to maximize cosmology constraining power. We present detailed simulations based on the Extended LSST Astronomical Time Series Classification Challenge (ELAsTiCC), and a cosmological analysis using photometrically classified SNeIa with host galaxy photometric redshifts. This dataset features realistic multi-band light curves, non-SNIa contamination, host mis-associations, and transient-host correlations across the high-redshift Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) (  50 deg^2). We also include a spectroscopically confirmed low-redshift sample based on the Wide Fast Deep (WFD) fields. We employ a joint SN+host photometric redshift fit, a neural network based photometric classifier (SCONE), and BEAMS with Bias Corrections (BBC) methodology to construct a bias-corrected Hubble diagram. We produce statistical + systematic covariance matrices, and perform cosmology fitting with a prior using Cosmic Microwave Background constraints. We fit and present results for the wCDM dark energy model, and the more general Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) w0wa model. With a simulated sample of  6000 events, we achieve a Figure of Merit (FoM) value of about 150, which is significantly larger than the DESVYR FoM of 54. Averaging analysis results over 25 independent samples, we find small but significant biases indicating a need for further analysis testing and development.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06372" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric Analysis of TCP J20171288$+$1156589 – WZ Sge Type Dwarf Nova with Delayed Ordinary Superhumps Emergence</a><span class="id">[2512.06372]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the results of photometric analysis of WZ Sge type dwarf nova TCP J20171288$+$1156589. This object exhibited an outburst with a large amplitude of $&gt;7.9$ magnitudes and was observed for over a month. The photometric evolution of the superoutburst was atypical for WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. Periodogram analisys reveals early superhumps with the most probable period of $0.0611\pm0.0001$ days during the initial decline. After a plateau phase of approximately 11 days, ordinary superhumps (likely stage B) emerged with a period of $0.0616\pm0.0001$ days, corresponding to a superhump excess of $\epsilon=0.008$ correspondingly. This delay in the onset of ordinary superhumps is an unusual feature among WZ Sge stars. We evaluated the main parameters of the system: mass ratio $q=M_{RD}/M_{WD}=0.06\pm0.005$, yielding component masses of $M_{WD}\sim1.0\pm0.15M_{\odot}$ for the white dwarf and $M_{RD}=0.06\pm0.01M_{\odot}$ for the donor. The estimated distance to the system is $\sim850$ pc, and the binary separation is $a=0.67\pm0.03R_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06394" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rebrightenings of gamma-ray burst afterglows from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar</a><span class="id">[2512.06394]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A nascent magnetar, accompanying a gamma-ray burst (GRB) explosion, releases enormous rotational energy via magnetic dipole radiation. The energy loss rate of the magnetar is determined by the strength of the magnetic field at the pole. We investigated the effect of the magnetic inclination angle on the energy loss rate. The released energy is injected into the GRB jet and shapes the light curves of GRB afterglow. Different evolutionary approaches lead to different curves shapes.A shallow decay phase in GRB X-ray afterglow may result from energy injection from a magnetar with a fixed inclination angle. A two-plateau phase may result from a decreasing inclination angle scenario. In this study, we considered an increasing inclination angle scenario. The energy loss rate of the magnetar increases as the magnetic inclination angle grows. Our analysis reveals that as the lost rotational energy injected into the GRB jet increases, rebrightening phases occur in the GRB afterglows. The rebrightening features are slight and short-lived. The observed afterglow rebrightening of GRB 170822A and GRB 230414B can be well explained within our framework. Some GRB X-ray afterglows that exhibit slight and early rebrightenings may result from an increasing magnetic inclination angle of a nascent magnetar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling dust coagulation, dynamical drag and turbulent mixing during star and disc formation</a><span class="id">[2512.06409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet formation in the discs around young stars involves the coagulation of sub-micron sized dust grains into much larger grains that may be mixed by turbulence and migrate through the disc. In this paper, we describe how we have combined a method for modelling the coagulation of a population of dust grains with the MULTIGRAIN algorithm for modelling the dynamical evolution of a population of dust grains that are subject to strong gas drag. We solve the dynamical evolution of the dust grains due to gas drag using a recently-developed implicit integration method, and we introduce a new implicit method to model the diffusion of the dust due to unresolved hydrodynamic turbulence. The resulting smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code allows us, for the first time, to model the growth, mixing and migration of dust grain populations during the early stages of star formation and the formation, growth and evolution of a young protoplanetary disc using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. In doing so, we find that including turbulent dust diffusion within the disc provides a substantial enhancement of the rate of dust grain growth due to the fact that the turbulent diffusion provides a source of small and intermediate dust grains to the regions in which the largest dust grains are growing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Water vapor emission at the warm cavity wall of the HD 100546 disk as revealed by ALMA</a><span class="id">[2512.06439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present spatially resolved ALMA observations of the water line at 183 GHz in the disk around the Herbig star HD 100546. The water vapor emission peaks at the inner edge of the warm dust cavity, located  15 au from the central star. We attribute this to thermal desorption at the water snowline, shifted outward at the dust cavity wall directly heated by the intense radiation. This represents the first spatially resolved image of the water snowline using ALMA observations of the main water isotopologue in a protoplanetary disk. The water emission morphology peaking inside the first dust ring is consistent with previous ALMA detections of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules in the disk, including thermally desorbed methanol. These findings signal that warm cavities of transition disks provide ideal targets to directly reconstruct the spatial distribution of water vapor and the snowline location with ALMA, and directly connect water vapor emission to ice desorption of complex organic species.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the Distance Duality Relation with Cosmological Observations at high Redshift using Artificial Neural Network</a><span class="id">[2512.06454]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic Distance Duality Relation (DDR) is a fundamental prediction of metric gravity under photon number conservation.

We conducted follow-up observations using ULTRACAM on the New Technology Telescope at the La Silla Observatory to search for the optical counterpart to the pulsar companions. We found two redback companions, in PSRs J1803$-$6707 and J1036$-$4353, and provided upper limits for the other pulsar binaries. We used the \texttt{Icarus} code to fit the redback's light curves using various irradiation models. The asymmetric double-peak light curves of PSR J1036$-$4353 are best fit with diffusion and convection models. Comparing the two prescriptions of irradiation and gravity darkening, models with post-irradiation gravity darkening provide superior fits (particularly for lower gravity-darkening exponents), suggesting that the irradiation energy is deposited deep in the stellar photosphere. PSR J1803$-$6707, on the other hand, displayed variability in the amplitude of its irradiation-dominated light curves over a time scale of a few months. This effect can be modelled only if the companion's filling, irradiation temperature, and convection coefficients are allowed to vary over time. Had the star been closer to filling its Roche lobe, like in the cases of the known transitional millisecond pulsars J1023+0038 and J1227$-$4853, this 4.1 per cent variation in the volume-averaged filling of the star would have caused it to experience a state change to form an active accretion disc.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Venus as an exoplanet analog: extended UV transit signatures and coronal occultations</a><span class="id">[2512.06509]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar activity manifests differently across wavelengths, causing flux variability that can obscure planetary transits. While transit observations are typically performed in the visible and infrared bands, where stellar flux is relatively stable, short-wavelength regimes exhibit high variability, complicating reliable detections. Here, we analyze the 2012 transit of Venus as an exoplanet analog using multiwavelength observations taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in five channels: 6173 Å (continuum), 1700 Å (broadband), and three extreme-UV (EUV) narrowbands at 304 Å, 171 Å, and 94 Å. We find that the disk-integrated transit signal is clearly detectable in the 6173 Å band, whereas strong solar activity-induced fluctuations obscure the transit in the EUV channels. Notably, the 1700 Å UV transit is noisier but significantly longer ($\approx 9.2$ hrs) than the visible-band transit ($\approx 6.7$ hrs), because Venus began occulting the extended coronal features before ingress onto the visible disk. This observation highlights the potential of UV transits to probe the spatial extent of stellar coronae in exoplanetary systems. Numerical simulations further suggest that limb-brightened stars in quiescence phase may exhibit distinctive UV/EUV transit signatures, opening new possibilities for exoplanet detection and characterization in these spectral regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06526" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exoplanets synchronization: Learning from Venus' retrograde rotation</a><span class="id">[2512.06526]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: Planets in the HZ can have dense atmospheres affecting their rotations. Over time, the rotation tends to stationary solutions that can be synchronous or asynchronous.

The creep tide theory is used to calculate the gravitational tidal torque.

While spectroscopic data from these surveys constrain the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature with high precision, the imaging surveys used for target selection can provide useful information on the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$. In this work we explore the feasibility of angular BAO measurements for the Intermediate-Band Imaging Survey (IBIS) using recent constraints on clustering from a pilot survey spanning $2.2&lt;z&lt;3.5$. Through Fisher forecasts, we find that a 5000 deg$^2$ survey of LAEs with realistic bias, a tracer density of $2\times 10^{-4}$ (h/Mpc)$^3$ and interloper fraction $f_{\rm int}=10\%$ can constrain the BAO dilation parameter $\alpha$ at $z_{\rm eff}=2.8$ with a precision of 2.6\%, with dependence on the sample properties that is consistent with shot noise-dominated measurements. We then explore medium-band survey specifications for the planned Stage-V Spectroscopic Instrument (Spec-S5) and beyond, demonstrating the potential for precise high-redshift BAO measurements. Our forecasts motivate early measurements of BAO from these imaging surveys, which may inform later spectroscopic analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Cosmic Magnetism with Rotation Measure-Squared-Galaxy Cross-Correlations</a><span class="id">[2512.06584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new approach for extracting information about cosmic magnetic fields using cross-correlations between extragalactic Faraday rotation measure (RM) catalogs and galaxy surveys. Specifically, we propose measuring the two-point cross-correlation between RM squared, ${\rm RM}^2$, towards background sources and the projected density field of foreground galaxies, $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$, as a function of transverse separation. This statistic is analogous to the ”projected fields” estimator used for the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect, $\langle {\rm kSZ}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$. Our estimator avoids contamination, and is also free from the noise bias that arises when correlating the absolute value of the RMs with galaxies. Moreover, by binning in foreground galaxy redshifts, $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ enables a tomographic reconstruction of the redshift evolution of large-scale cosmic magnetic fields. We model this statistic using the Illustris-TNG cosmological magnetohydrodynamic simulations and compare with approximate analytic predictions. We show that $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ can be related to a bispectrum involving two copies of the electron-density–weighted magnetic field strength and one of the galaxy overdensity. In Illustris-TNG, the effective field strength is primarily set by the magnetic field amplitudes within the inner regions of galaxy-hosting dark matter halos. It increases towards low redshift, driven by dynamo amplification and magnetized outflows. Our forecasts suggest that $\langle {\rm RM}^2 \times {\rm g} \rangle$ is detectable at high significance with current galaxy surveys and future RM catalogs from the SKA, offering a tomographic probe of large-scale magnetic fields across cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06701" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What Galaxy Clusters Have to Say About Dynamical Dark Energy and $H_0$</a><span class="id">[2512.06701]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that, in flat $\Lambda$CDM, low-redshift structure probes – cluster abundances, 3$\times$2-point analyses, and full-shape clustering – are mutually consistent, jointly delivering precise constraints on $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ that agree with geometrical datasets (CMB+BAO+SN).

The supersymmetry-based WZDR framework has demonstrated considerable potential in alleviating the Hubble tension. Previous investigations have examined the interaction between stepped dark radiation and cold dark matter, with the aim of simultaneously addressing both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. Given the suppressive effect of scalar field dark matter on small-scale structure growth, we replace cold dark matter with scalar field dark matter in the present work and introduce its interaction with stepped dark radiation via pure momentum coupling, thereby formulating a novel coupling model. We impose constraints on the model parameters using a variety of cosmological datasets, including the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Type Ia Supernovae, $H_0$ measurements from SH0ES, $S_8$ data from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3, and data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. Our analysis reveals that the performance of the new model is nearly identical to that of the original WZDR model, with only a marginal improvement. When using the full data combination, the best-fit values for $H_0$ in the coupled model and WZDR model are 70.89 km/s/Mpc and 70.68 km/s/Mpc, respectively. For the $S_8$ parameter, the new model results in a decrease from 0.8136 in the original model to 0.8113. Furthermore, the coupling signal remains weak, with the constraint on the coupling parameter being $\log_{10}(\xi)&lt;4.56$. While the coupling model offers some improvement, it does not fully resolve the cosmological tensions, indicating that further investigation is required to address these issues.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the atmosphere of HAT-P-70b with CARMENES high-resolution transmission spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2512.06731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Owing to hot and inflated envelopes that facilitate atmospheric studies, ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have attracted much attention.

By using the line-by-line technique, we confirm the previous detections of Ha, Na I, and Ca II, report a new tentative detection of K I, and impose an upper limit on the He triplet absorption. Through cross-correlation analysis, we identify the Ca II and Fe I absorptions, both blue-shifted by approximately 5 km/s, indicating a day-to-night side atmospheric wind. Additionally, we find a new tentative detection of K I. We do not see any significant atmospheric molecular signal in the near-infrared data. Putting HAT-P-70b in the context of UHJs from the literature, it turns out that (1) Ha absorption is more common on gas giants orbiting stars younger than 1 Gyr, with a relative detection probability of $P_{\rm Age&lt;1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})/P_{\rm Age\geq1\,Gyr}({\rm Ha})\sim 3$; (2) any UHJ is likely to exhibit Fe I absorption if it has Ca II.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Non-thermal Synchrotron Emission and Polarization Signatures during Black Hole Flux Eruptions</a><span class="id">[2512.06803]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate synchrotron emission and the observational signatures of anisotropic non-thermal electrons during magnetic-flux eruptions in a magnetically arrested disk, using 3D GRMHD simulations.

We perform Bayesian model comparison by jointly fitting multicolour light curves from TESS and ground-based follow-up, including observations with HiPERCAM at the 10.4-m GTC. Our approach uses wavelength-dependent transit depth variations and precise transit geometry to reject false positives. We validate TOI-2094 b and TOI-7166 b as two new benchmark temperate mini-Neptunes.

The brightness of the host star makes TOI-7166 a suitable target for radial velocity follow-up to measure the planetary mass and bulk density.

Recent studies reopened the possibility of a mass window of PBHs as a compelling candidate for dark matter, particularly in low-mass regimes ($M_{\text {PBH}}&lt; 10^{15}$ g) where conventional constraints from evaporation are being revisited in light of quantum gravitational effects. One such effect, the \textit{memory burden effect}, slows down black hole evaporation by incorporating the backreaction of radiation on the black hole microstates, substantially extending the lifetime of light PBHs and thus modifying their late-time emission spectra. This prolonged emission can dramatically alter the energy injection history in the early universe. By computing the modified energy injection rates into the intergalactic medium and incorporating them into the thermal and ionization evolution of neutral hydrogen, we obtain projected constraints on the fraction of dark matter. The bounds are obtained from the fact that these low mass PBHs, which were thought otherwise evaporated, can modify the absorption amplitude in the global 21 cm signal at redshift $z\approx17$. Considering the two viable scenarios of transition to the memory-burden phase: fast (or instantaneous) and slow (transition with a finite width), we show how the 21 cm bounds are sensitive to different mass ranges. For a broad transition with $\delta=10^{-2}$ we find that PBHs in the mass range $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq10^{8}$-$10^{13}$ g are excluded at the level of $f_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{-8}$. In contrast, for a fast-transition case ($k=1$), the evaporation is suppressed so efficiently that no meaningful 21 cm constraint remains for $M_{\rm PBH}\gtrsim10^{7}$ g.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anisotropic Diffusion Modeling of Cosmic-Ray Lepton Propagation</a><span class="id">[2512.06972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze DAMPE and H.E.S.S. measurements of the total cosmic-ray electron-positron spectrum, together with the AMS-02 positron fraction, using an anisotropic, spatially varying diffusion framework.

Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paucity of downward UHE neutrino tracks in IceCube versus unexpected huge KM3-230213A event: solving the puzzles?</a><span class="id">[2512.07042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently the ARCA array detector published the down-ward-horizontal event: the KM3-230213A.

It is not statistically consistent with several upper bound derived by two greater and longer life detectors: by IceCube and in particular by AUGER array. Asymmetry in recent IceCube neutrino alert tracks upward and downward at same horizontal angles as ARCA one, suggest that they are mostly polluted atmospheric muon bundles. This paucity also disfavor the skimming neutrino interpretation by ARCA. We suggest that the array floating and bending in the deep sea may lead, sometime, to a misleading geometry that is pointing to a wrong arrival angle direction: a much less horizontal muon (neutrino) track respect to a much real one, more inclined and vertical, due to atmospheric muon bundle or charmed single event. Contrary to present argument, if such a rare event would be soon rediscovered in data or re-observed, it would open the road to a new guaranteed Tau neutrino Astronomy.

While CPL serves as a reference parameterization, the Omnipotent and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM scenarios were originally proposed as possible solutions to the $H_0$ tension and are selected here because they can yield negative dark energy. These models are examined within a multi-probe framework based on the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect and the lensing-ISW bispectrum. By analyzing both two- and three-point Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) correlations, we assess how their late-time dynamics modify the growth and decay of large-scale gravitational potentials compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Despite producing nearly indistinguishable CMB angular spectra at high multipoles, these models yield distinctive signatures in the low-$\ell$ ISW plateau as well as in higher-order statistics related to ISW, highlighting the power of both large-scale CMB anisotropies and higher-order CMB statistics in testing dark energy physics.

To study trends in frequencies and amplitudes, and possibly spectacular phenomena like resonant amplification, we perform a series of axisymmetric long-duration magnetohydrodynamic CCSN simulations of a 17 $M_\odot$ progenitor using a finely spaced grid in initial rotation rate from 0.29 rad/s to 3.48 rad/s. We find that these rotating models produce GWs at frequencies of up to 3 kHz, higher than in typical non-rotating models in the literature. The high frequencies arise due to small polar radii of rapidly rotating proto-neutron stars and stabilization by angular momentum gradients at lower latitude. GW frequencies and amplitudes tend to decrease with faster rotation. Different from two complementary simulations without magnetic fields, the magnetohydrodynamic models are characterized by an absence of p-modes above the dominant high-frequency emission band. We find no indication of resonant mode amplification for any rotation rate, although a temporo-spatial and space-frequency analysis reveals some interesting couplings of quadrupolar motions across the proto-neutron star and the gain region. We find that linear mode analysis based on the spherically averaged structure becomes unsuitable in this regime of rapid rotation. More advanced perturbative techniques need to be developed to study the mode structure and mode interaction in the collapse of rapidly rotating massive stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Dark Energy in light of DESI BAO and Full-Shape Data</a><span class="id">[2512.07104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the DESI BAO data has reported a preference of dynamical dark energy (DDE) over the $\Lambda$ this http URL from the BAO data, the DDE model should be also sensitive to low-redshift measurements of matter power this http URL this study, we address this point by combining the DESI Y1 data about the matter power spectrum, extracted from the DESI Full-Shape data, with the DESI DR2 BAO data among this http URL building the DESI Y1 likelihood,we carry out a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis, showing that the constraints on $w_0$ and $w_{a}$ with DESI Y1 data included are improved over those without it for three different datasets widely considered,especially in the case of DESY5 sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07105" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Universal relation involving fundamental modes in two-fluid dark matter admixed neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2512.07105]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We systematically investigate the fundamental oscillation frequencies of dark matter admixed neutron stars, focusing on models with self-interacting fermionic dark matter that couples to normal matter solely through gravity.

Meanwhile, they show diverse DM and rotation measure (RM) variations, which cannot be explained by current models. A unified model urgently needs to be established. Here we show the first evidence for a supernova remnant surrounding the FRB 20190520B source. We then demonstrate that the five active repeating FRB sources associated with PRSs can be understood within a single model in which central objects are young magnetars in massive binary systems embedded in supernova remnants. This model naturally predicts distinct variations of DM and RM for repeating FRBs. Crucially, young magnetar wind nebulae can generate bright PRSs. As a magnetar becomes older, the luminosity of a PRS will fade, which can naturally explain less-luminous PRSs for some active FRBs.

The initial setup consists of two idealized, spherical subclusters with a mass ratio below three, each permeated by turbulent magnetic fields, and we follow their mergers with a high-order accurate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. In parallel, we track the acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons (CRe) via diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at merger-driven shocks, together with radiative cooling and Fermi-II (turbulent) acceleration in the postshock region, employing a high-order Fokker-Planck solver. Synchrotron emission is computed from the simulated CRe distribution and magnetic fields. In this paper, we detail these numerical approaches and present the first results obtained with them. Two prominent axial shocks emerge along the merger axis; the shock ahead of the heavier subcluster systematically attains a higher Mach number, although it is more compact, than that ahead of the lighter subcluster. Turbulent magnetic fields–both inherited from the initial condition and amplified during the merger–produce patchy, fine-scale structures in the radio surface brightness. Because of the combined effects of turbulent acceleration, spatially nonuniform magnetic fields, and the curved geometry of merger shocks, the volume-integrated radio spectra show deviations from the canonical power-law steepening expected for a planar shock with a uniform field. Reacceleration of preexisting fossil CRe enhances the surface brightness. Our results highlight the coupled roles of merger dynamics, MHD turbulence, and CRe physics in shaping up the observed properties of radio relics in cluster outskirts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EP241217a: a likely Type II GRB with an achromatic bump at z = 4.59</a><span class="id">[2512.07233]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>EP241217a is an X-ray transient detected by the Einstein Probe (EP) lasting for about 100 seconds and without accompanying $\gamma$-ray detection. The optical spectroscopy reveals the redshift of EP241217a is 4.59. By combining the $\gamma$-ray upper limit provided by GECAM-C, there is a considerable possibility that EP241217a is a typical Type II gamma-ray burst (GRB), but it is fainter than the detection threshold of any available $\gamma$-ray monitors (i.e., $E_{\gamma,{\rm iso}}\lesssim10^{53}$ erg). The X-ray light curve exhibits a plateau lasting for $\sim5\times10^4$ seconds. However, the joint analysis with optical data suggests the presence of an achromatic bump peaking at $\sim3\times10^4$ s after the trigger, indicating the actual duration of the X-ray plateau may be significantly shorter than it appears. To interpret the achromatic bump, we adopt the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in a wind-like medium and encountering a rapid density enhancement of the circumburst medium, which is likely induced by the the interaction of the progenitor's stellar wind and the interstellar medium. However, this model cannot fully explain observed data, and some issues do exist, e.g., the observed spectrum is harder than the model prediction. Consequently, we conclude that the scenario of a mildly relativistic jet coasting in the wind-like medium cannot explain all observed features of EP241217a. In addition, some alternative models commonly invoked to explain X-ray plateaus are discussed, but there are more or less issues when they are applied to EP241217a. Therefore, further theoretical modeling is encouraged to explore the origin of EP241217a.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inference of $B$-mode polarization in the presence of non-Gaussian foregrounds</a><span class="id">[2512.07235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The inflationary $B$-mode signals encode invaluable information about the origin of our Universe and searching for potential signatures of primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) is one of the major science goals for future precision observations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. However, dominant $B$-mode signals of both Galactic foreground contamination and gravitational lensing effects prevent direct measurements of the PGW $B$-mode signals. There are existing proposals which can effectively eliminate these two contaminants but issues remain for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency CMB polarization observations, such as spatially-varying spectral energy distribution (SED) of polarized foreground and cosmological $B$-mode signals due to primordial magnetic fields (PMFs). In this work, we investigate inference of PGW $B$-mode signals in the presence of both complexities. We employ a constrained moment internal linear combination (cMILC) method to remove polarization signals arising from spatially varying SEDs. Also, we employ a power-spectrum-based approach to extracting both the Galactic and cosmological $B$-mode components. Two methods have been validated by mock data and different consistency tests have been performed. We apply these two methods to end-to-end simulations for future high-sensitivity and multifrequency polarization observations and investigate the detectability of different $B$-mode signals in the presence of non-Gaussian polarized foregrounds under different scenarios. This study will be important for new physics studies with $B$-mode signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Counting voids and filaments: Betti Curves as a Powerful Probe for Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2512.07236]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Topological analysis of galaxy distributions has gathered increasing attention in cosmology, as they are able to capture non-Gaussian features of large-scale structures (LSS) that are overlooked by conventional two-point clustering statistics. We utilize Betti curves, a summary statistic derived from persistent homology, to characterize the multiscale topological features of the LSS, including connected components, loops, and voids, as a complementary cosmological probe. Using halo catalogs from the \textsc{Quijote} suite, we construct Betti curves, assess their sensitivity to cosmological parameters, and train automated machine learning based emulators to model their dependence on cosmological parameters. Our Bayesian inference recovers unbiased estimation of cosmological parameters, notably $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $\sigma_8$, and $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$, while validation on sub-box simulations confirms robustness against cosmic variance. We further investigate the impact of redshift-space distortions (RSD) on Betti curves and demonstrate that including RSD enhances sensitivity to growth-related parameters. By jointly analyzing Betti curves and the power spectrum, we achieve significantly tightened constraints than using power spectrum alone on parameters such as $n_{\mathrm{s}}$, $\sigma_8$, and $w$. These findings highlight Betti curves – especially when combined with traditional two-point statistics – as a promising, interpretable tool for future galaxy survey analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Dark Energy and the Unresolved Hubble Tension: Multi-model Constraints from DESI 2025 and Other Probes</a><span class="id">[2512.07281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a Bayesian comparative analysis of five cosmological models: $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, $w_0w_a$CDM, $\phi$CDM (with scalar-field dark energy), and an interacting dark energy scenario (the $\xi$ model), to investigate dark energy evolution and the Hubble tension. Utilizing the latest data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, BAO), Pantheon+ (Type Ia Supernovae, SNIa), and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data (including lensing) from \textit{Planck} and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), we report three key findings. First, the Hubble constant ($H_0$) inferred from the combined data consistently aligns with early-universe measurements across all models, indicating a persistent Hubble tension. Second, we find compelling evidence for dynamical dark energy: early-universe (CMB) constraints favor a phantom phase (with an equation-of-state parameter $w &lt; -1$), while late-universe (BAO/SNIa) data prefer quintessence ($w &gt; -1$).

Small-scale events of this kind were already known, but their observation was occasional or with limited, lower resolution. Solar Orbiter has revealed that small scale, highly impulsive events are everywhere on the quiet Sun, all the time, at even smaller scales. Their similarity with known larger features, are the witnesses that the physical processes causing them are independent of the spatial scales involved. Their highly dynamic property is the signature of energy transfer and/or local dissipation. Their investigation can thus elucidate on the dominant physical processes acting on the solar atmosphere and on the possible role in the origin of the hot solar corona. In this review, we will present a summary of the observational and simulation results on this topic, led by the results from data taken by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI)/High Resolution Imagers (HRIEUV) instrument.

Pulsar halos are a recently discovered class of TeV gamma-ray sources formed by escaping electrons/positrons from pulsars. The morphology of the halo is regulated by the diffusion of those escaping particles, and hence carries information of the interstellar magnetic field. We suggest that the morphology of TeV pulsar halos can be used as a novel probe of the properties of interstellar magnetic field around the pulsar, such as the Alfvénic Mach number and the mean direction. We establish a theoretical relation between these quantities and the observational features of the halo's morphology based on the anisotropic diffusion model, and show how X-ray observations of the pulsar halos can further improve the diagnosis of the magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting PBH Accretion, Evaporation and Their Cosmological Consequences</a><span class="id">[2512.07291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe. Their cosmological evolution is governed by the competition between mass accretion and Hawking evaporation. In this paper we look into the details impact of accretion. Most of the earlier analysis relied on non-relativistic accretion models. In this work, we reinvestigate this in a fully relativistic framework for Kerr PBHs in the radiation-dominated era. We derive relativistic accretion rate and compute spin-dependent efficiency $\lambda_{\text{Kerr}}(a_*)$. Using this result, we construct coupled evolution equations for the PBH mass and spin that include both relativistic accretion and spin-dependent evaporation. Our analysis shows that relativistic accretion significantly increases PBH masses and consequently suppresses their spins, causing all PBHs to become effectively Schwarzschild well before evaporation. These effects strengthen the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound on the initial PBH mass by a factor of $\sim 4$–$5$, reduce the mass required for survival to the present epoch to $\sim 2.7\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{g}$, and shift the viable particle like DM parameter space. Notably the early accretion induced spin-down effect further washes out the well known high-frequency, spin-induced feature in the high frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background, modifying predictions for future detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squeezed Limit non-Gaussianity Estimation with Cosmic Shear</a><span class="id">[2512.07295]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new method to constrain local primordial non-Gaussianity using the large-scale modulation of the local lensing power spectrum.

Our method is simpler to implement than a full bispectrum estimator, but still contains the full squeezed-limit information. We validate our model using a suite of N-body simulations and demonstrate its accuracy in recovering the $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ values. We then perform a Fisher forecast for an LSST-like weak lensing survey, finding $\sigma_{f_{\mathrm{NL}}} \simeq 12$.

Investigating the orbital period variations of EZ Oct reveals a steadily increasing period consistent with a quadratic trend. We present a new ephemeris and estimate the mass transfer rate as \dot{M}=1.353*10^{-8} M_{\odot}/year, indicating ongoing conservative mass transfer from the less massive to the more massive star. Light curve modeling was performed using the PHOEBE Python code in conjunction with the MCMC approach, and the inclusion of a cold starspot was required to achieve an adequate fit. Absolute parameters were estimated using Gaia DR3 parallax and astrophysical equations. Our analysis shows that EZ Oct is a total-eclipse contact binary with a mass ratio of 1.969, a fillout factor of 0.106, and an inclination of 82.13deg. Based on the stellar masses and temperatures of the components, the target system belongs to the W-subtype of contact binaries. The positions of the component stars were displayed on the mass-luminosity and mass-radius diagrams to illustrate their evolutionary status. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between orbital period and stellar luminosity in contact binary stars using a sample of 461 systems with P&lt;0.5 days.

A plausible source of this heating is reflection-driven turbulence (RDT), in which gradients in the background Alfvén speed partially reflect outward-propagating Alfvén waves, seeding counter-propagating fluctuations that interact and dissipate via turbulence. Previous RDT models assume a radial background magnetic field, but at larger radii the interplanetary field is known to be twisted into the Parker Spiral (PS). Here, we generalize RDT phenomenology to include a PS, using three-dimensional expanding-box magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations to test the ideas and compare the resulting turbulence to the radial-background-field case. We argue that the underlying RDT dynamics remain broadly similar with a PS, but the controlling scales change: as the azimuthal field grows it &quot;cuts across&quot; perpendicularly stretched, pancake-like eddies, producing outer scales perpendicular to the magnetic field that are much smaller than in the radial-background case. Consequently, the outer-scale nonlinear turnover time increases more slowly with heliocentric distance in PS geometry, weakening the tendency (seen in radial-background models) for the cascade to 'freeze' into quasi-static, magnetically dominated structures. This allows the system to dissipate a larger fraction of the fluctuation energy as heat, also implying that the turbulence remains strongly imbalanced (with high normalized cross-helicity) out to larger heliocentric distances. We complement our heating results with a detailed characterization of the turbulence (e.g., spectra, switchbacks, and compressive fractions) providing a set of concrete predictions for comparison with spacecraft observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surface temperature of an accretion disk around a wormhole Kerr-mimicker</a><span class="id">[2512.07466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It has been suggested that spinning wormholes may mimic Kerr black holes in astronomical sources such as X-ray binaries and supermassive compact objects in centers of galaxies. With recent advances in instrumentation this could be tested if clear differences between wormhole and black hole accretion were identified. We aim to quantitatively determine the extent to which the orbital properties of test particles in the gravity of a spinning wormhole may differ from those of a Kerr black hole. We seek to find an observable related to disk accretion that would be clearly different for Kerr black holes and Kerr-like wormholes. We use the standard Lagrangian approach to derive the orbital properties of test particles from an effective potential. We use standard thin disk theory to infer the disk surface temperature. We find that at a given circumferential radius the physical quantities relating to circular orbits in the equatorial plane are exactly the same for the spinning wormhole and a black hole of the same mass and angular momentum, if only the two space-time metrics differ in the g_rr component alone. However, for a wormhole there are no orbits of radius less than that of its throat. Non-circular orbits, bound or unbound, are affected by the radial distance function; in particular, the angle of apsidal precession in Kerr-like wormholes will differ from that in Kerr black holes. A Kerr-like wormhole is a perfect black hole mimicker in relation to the orbital properties in the equatorial plane. The angular velocity, specific energy, specific angular momentum, and Lense-Thirring precession rate are the same for a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-like wormhole in circular orbits of the same circumference. We find that the area of the (geometrically thin) accretion disk is different, and this yields a visibly suppressed disk temperature for traversable wormholes with a sufficiently wide throat.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07566" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-stage primary acceleration in filament initial eruption under a fan-spine magnetic configuration</a><span class="id">[2512.07566]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understaning the filament rising process is crucial for unveiling the triggering mechanisms of the coronal mass ejections and forecasting the space weather. In this paper, we present a detailed study on the filament initial eruption under a fan-spine structure. It was found that the filament underwent two distinct acceleration stages corresponding to a calss M1.0 and M4.6 flare event, respectively. The first acceleration stage commenced with the filament splitting, after which the upper portion was subsequently heated being a hot channel and slow rose at an average speed of 22 km/s. A set of hot reverse C-shaped loops appeared repeatedly during the filament splitting and a hook structure was recognized at this phase, suggesting ongoing growth of the magnetic flux rope (MFR). When it reached a certain altitude, the hot channel appeared to get into a quasi-static phase with its upper edge seriously decelerated and lower edge expanding downward. Approximately 30 minutes later, as a distinct annular ribbon appeared outside the hook structure, the hot channel rose again at a velocity over 50 km/s accompanied with rapid footpoints drifting, and experienced the second acceleration stage with its axial flux increased to 1.1 X 10^{21} Mx. It is deduced that the filament initial eruption under a magnetic dome possess multi kinetic process. We suggest that the magnetic reconnection taken place within and beneath the filament continues to trigger the growth of pre-eruptive MFR and the first acceleration, when the magnetic reconnection above the filament plays a key role in the second acceleration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Systematic determination of dust properties for a sample of 133 spatially resolved debris discs</a><span class="id">[2512.07573]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Determination of the composition and size distribution of dust grains in debris discs is strongly dependent on constraining the underlying spatial distribution of that dust through multi-wavelength, spatially resolved imaging spanning near-infrared to millimetre wavelengths. To date, spatially resolved imaging exists for well over a hundred debris disc systems. Simple analytical radiative transfer models of debris dust emission can reveal trends in disc properties as a function of their host stars' luminosities. Here we present such an analysis for 133 debris discs, calculating the dust grain minimum sizes ($s_{\rm min}$), dust masses ($M_{\rm dust}$), and exponents of the size distribution ($q$) in conjunction with their architectures determined at far-infrared or millimetre wavelengths. The distribution of $q$ at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths is characterised for the first time, finding a value of $3.49^{+0.38}_{-0.33}$. We further newly identify a trend between $q$ and $R_{\rm disc}$, which may be indicative of velocity dependent fragmentation, or grain growth at large radii. We find the disc masses inferred from this analysis are consistent with those of protoplanetary discs.

We simulate low-resolution spectroscopy (R = 10, 20, 30, presented as photometric bandwidth fraction 10%, 5%, 3% herein) as a proxy for narrow-band photometric observations, and constrain the wavelength range from 0.85 - 1.05 microns, to narrow focus on the 0.9 microns feature. We then constrain the number of spectral points to 2 or 3 points at each bandwidth fraction to investigate the impact of spectral point placement on detectability. Additionally, we take the signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for strong H2O detection and calculate the resultant exoplanet yields assuming photometric observation and compare to the yields from higher-resolution spectroscopic observations under different noise instances, characterization wavelength, noise floors, and aperture sizes. We find that H2O is strongly detectable at all bandwidth fractions depending on the spectral point placement, requiring a minimum of 3 spectral points, at a variety of normalized exposure time depending on the abundance of H2O. We also find that the detector noise is the main driver in determining whether photometry or spectroscopy results in higher yields.

Our main results are as follows: (1) The speed distributions of blueshifted spicules and NBPs both exhibit distinct peaks, whereas that of redshifted spicules is monotonically decreasing. (2) Torsional motions of spicules inferred from alternating signs of Dopplershifts are faster than the NBPs' transversal motions by a factor of $10-10^2$, which may imply the mass density ratio in two different heights as $10^2-10^4$. (3) Blueshifted spicules are found to be more abundant than redshifted spicules in general, but their relative population difference reduces to  10% at Doppler speeds above 35 km s$^{-1}$. (4) Redshifted spicules lying at higher heights share morphological and dynamical similarity with the blueshifted spicules, which implies the same driving mechanism operating in both directions. (5) These two populations appear above NBPs concentrated under the AIA 193 A bright region.

However, JWST transit observations of the TRAPPIST-1 planets show significant contamination from stellar surface features that we are unable to confidently model. Here, we present the motivation and first observations of our JWST multi-cycle program of TRAPPIST-1 e, which utilize close transits of the airless TRAPPIST-1 b to model-independently correct for stellar contamination, with the goal of determining whether TRAPPIST-1 e has an Earth-like mean molecular weight atmosphere containing CO$_2$. We present our simulations, which show that with the 15 close transit observations, we will be able to detect this atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 e at $\Delta\ln\,Z=5$ or greater confidence assuming we are able to correct for stellar contamination using the close transit observations. We also show the first three observations of our program. We find that our ability to correct for stellar contamination can be inhibited when strong stellar flares are present, as flares can break the assumption that the star does not change meaningfully between planetary transits. The cleanest observation demonstrates the removal of stellar contamination contribution through an increased preference for a flat line over the original TRAPPIST-1 e spectrum, but highlights how minor data analysis assumptions can propagate significantly when searching for small atmospheric signals. This is amplified when using the signals from multiple planets, which is important to consider as we continue our atmospheric search.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZTF-SEDm Type Ia supernova sample for Twins Embedding spectrophotometric standardisation</a><span class="id">[2512.07696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper has two aims: the first one is to build a large homogeneous spectrophotometric Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) sample, using 3069 spectra from the second Zwicky Transient Facility data release (ZTF DR2). Using this sample we reproduce, as the second objective of the paper, the Twins Embedding (TE) spectrophotometric standardisation method, which led to an exceptionally low value of 0.073 mag for the intrinsic scatter. We improve the flux-calibration accuracy of the SEDm SN Ia spectral sample using the ZTF photometric data, which are calibrated at the percent level. We then apply the three steps of the TE parameterisation to a subset of 783 ZTF SN spectra near maximum light, and analyse the resulting standardisation methods. The precision of the phase correction model, which is the first step of the TE, is estimated at 0.01 mag in g band, using ZTF data. Despite the challenge posed by the ZTF spectrum extraction pipeline, we apply a first standardisation in color based on the second step of the TE, the Read Between The Lines (RBTL). When considering the scatter due to the redshift error and the flux calibration error, we estimate a 0.129 mag Hubble residual scatter for this ZTF sample as an upper limit. As expected from the low spectral quality, the final TE standardisation based on three non-linear parameters did not improve the overall dispersion. We release 1897 flux calibrated spectra of 1607 SNe Ia with an estimated photometric accuracy of 0.07 mag. We further demonstrate the ability to apply a spectrophotometric standardisation with limited quality spectra. The RBTL standardisation is more efficient than that of SALT with one less parameter, and the resulting host steps are consistent with zero, making it less prone to astrophysical bias. For future spectroscopic surveys, a better spectral quality would enable the full TE standardisation to be computed.

On longer orbits, planets are less affected by their host star, and become ideal probes of planet formation, migration and evolution. We report the discovery of a long period Neptune and two Saturns, each initially identified as single transits in the TESS photometry, and solved through additional transits from ground-based follow-up photometric observations by NGTS and ASTEP. High-resolution radial velocity mass measurements using CORALIE and HARPS confirm their planetary nature. From joint modelling of the photometric and spectroscopic data, we determine an orbital period of $43.12655_{-0.00017}^{+0.00012}~$days, radius of $3.65\pm0.22~\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$, and mass of $19.1_{-4.5}^{+4.9}~\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$ for NGTS-34b, making it one of the longest period well-characterized transiting Neptunes. Orbiting a late F-type star, bright in the K-band (Kmag$~\simeq7.9$), it is amenable for cool atmosphere studies using JWST or Ariel. TOI-4940b is a small Saturn on a $25.867811_{-0.000056}^{+0.000058}~$day orbit with a radius of $6.61\pm0.37~\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and an upper mass limit $&lt;89~\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$. NGTS-35b(=TOI-6669b) is a larger Saturn on a $25.241192\pm0.000022~$day, moderately eccentric orbit ($e = 0.192_{-0.033}^{+0.037}$), with a radius of $10.90\pm0.65~\mathrm{R_{\oplus}}$ and a mass of $152_{-19}^{+22}~\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$. With an assumed albedo $A=0.3$, each of these planets has an equilibrium temperature below 700K, with NGTS-35b especially cold at $450~$K. These three giants add to the small but growing population of long period planets that can further our understanding of planet formation mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-Wavelength Afterglows as Diagnostic Probes of Dense Circumburst Medium in GRBs</a><span class="id">[2512.07719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray Analysis of Gamma-Ray Burst Flares and Underlying Afterglows: Insights into Origin of Flares</a><span class="id">[2512.07731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray burst (GRB) X-ray light curves exhibit a variety of complex temporal structures, such as flares and plateaus. The origin of flares seen in many GRB early afterglows is still uncertain. Here, we analyze a sample of 89 GRBs, 61 of them with flares, both with and without a &quot;plateau&quot; phase. We fit the Swift-XRT light curves with synchrotron emission from a forward shock propagating into either a constant-density ISM or a stellar wind, and flares on top of that. We find that the flare light curves are not symmetric, with a decay time that is $\sim$five times longer than the rise time. We do not find any differences in flare properties between GRBs with and without a &quot;plateau&quot; phase. Moreover, additional afterglow properties such as the electron power-law index and the end time of the plateau are consistent between bursts with and without flares. These results strongly indicate that flares originate from a mechanism distinct from that producing the plateau and afterglow. When looking at the prompt emission properties, we do find some tendencies: GRBs with flares tend to be brighter and longer lasting than GRBs without flares. We therefore conclude that, unlike plateaus, flares are unlikely to arise from an external origin and are more plausibly associated with prolonged central engine activity that lasts longer than the main episode that produces the prompt phase. As the plateau cannot have the same origin, this result excludes models of late-time energy injection as the source of the GRB plateau.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microquasar remnants as hidden PeVatrons</a><span class="id">[2512.07781]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) has revealed numerous ultrahigh-energy gamma-ray sources of unknown origin.

Cosmic rays injected during the active phase of a microquasar may remain confined within its cocoon and subsequently interact with nearby molecular clouds, producing bright gamma-ray emission through $pp$ collisions.

Cosmic messengers, especially neutrinos, play a central role in probing new physics, as they provide experimental conditions far beyond the reach of laboratories and serve as the link between laboratory fundamental-physics discoveries and their roles in the Universe, where many new physics motivations originate. In this work, we propose a novel probe of neutrino self-interactions through ultra-high-energy neutrinos scattering off the cosmic neutrino background when the lightest neutrino species remains relativistic today. This allows us to “Widen the Resonance” of such scattering. Meanwhile, we also provide a semi-analytic framework for cosmogenic UHE neutrino production, avoiding computationally intensive simulations and yielding results precise enough for BSM studies. The widened resonance enables future ultrahigh-energy neutrino telescopes, in particular GRAND, to probe mediator masses from MeV to GeV, reaching couplings down to $g \sim 10^{-3}$ – up to two orders of magnitude beyond current bounds. Our results enhance the discovery potential of $\nu$SI in the high-mass regime, potentially offering crucial insights into the connections between the neutrino sector and dark sector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05980" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quenching factors for Na recoils as a function of Tl dopant concentrations in NaI(Tl) crystals</a><span class="id">[2512.05980]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) scintillation detectors play an important role in the field of direct dark matter (DM) searches. The DAMA/LIBRA experiment stands out for its reported observation of an annually modulating DM-like signal, which is in direct contrast with other results. To accurately calibrate the energies of nuclear recoil signals with electron recoils, precise measurements of the quenching factor of the NaI(Tl) crystals are essential, as the two processes have different scintillation light yield. In this article, we present results of a systematic study carried out by the COSINUS collaboration and Duke University to measure the quenching factor of sodium (Na) recoils as a function of nuclear recoil energy and for differing Thallium (Tl) dopant concentrations in the bulk crystal. Five ultrapure NaI(Tl) crystals, manufactured by the Shanghai Institute for Ceramics, were irradiated with a quasi-monoenergetic neutron beam at the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratory, North Carolina, USA. The quenching factor for low nuclear recoil energies of 5-26keV$_{nr}$ was extracted for all 5 crystals. A Tl-dependence could be deduced with a proportional response calibration schema using a $^{241}$Am source.

In this paper, we investigate the possibility of the phantom crossing, and we construct realistic models realizing the crossing in the framework of the scalar–Einstein–Gauss-Bonnet gravity and ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity. We also investigate the scenario of the apparent phantom crossing, where dark matter energy density decreases more slowly than usually expected, which might explain the DESI observations. In the scenarios developed, the energy conditions are not violated by any component of the cosmic fluid. In the framework of the apparent phantom crossing, we also propose a new scenario, where the particle corresponding to the scalar field in the scalar–Einstein–Gauss-Bonnet gravity is dark matter. The mass of the particle might increase due to the coupling with the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, which makes the decrease of the dark matter energy density slower. This last scenario may suggest that the inverse phantom crossing might be related to the transition from the decelerating expansion of the Universe to the accelerating expansion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06441" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining meV Axion Dark Matter with ALMA Observations of the Galactic Center Magnetar SGR 1745-2900</a><span class="id">[2512.06441]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a mm-wave search for axions from the magnetar SGR 1745-2900, based on 4.8 h of ALMA observations.

In the present study, we consider the case of dark matter described by a massive vector field, also referred to as the Proca field. The density profile in the vicinity of the black hole is explicitly constructed for a broad range of dark matter mass, $\mu\sim 10^{-10}-10^{-15}{\mathrm eV}$, which allows it to exhibit both particle and wave-like characteristics. While in the particle regime, the computation of the DM density distribution is analytically tractable, we find it convenient to compute the same numerically in the wave regime. Nevertheless, in the outer region, the surrounding dark matter is assumed to follow a broken power-law distribution, represented by a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile with a central spike. For the purpose of investigating the detectability of the vector dark matter in the gravitational wave spectrum, we have modelled a stellar-mass black hole ($1M_{\odot}$) inspiralling into a Schwarzschild black hole of mass $10^4M_{\odot}$ within such a vector dark matter environment. With this setup, we analyzed the dephasing in the gravitational wave strain induced by vector dark matter and performed a Fisher forecast for upcoming LISA observations, with particular emphasis on the distinctive features in both the particle and wave regimes of the dark matter. Additionally, most of the important results have been compared with the scalar dark matter case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07268" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genesis of Axion Dark Matter via Black Hole and Cosmic String Dynamics</a><span class="id">[2512.07268]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The global $U_{PQ}(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry, proposed to resolve the strong CP problem, predicts the existence of the axion, a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson and a leading dark matter candidate. The spontaneous breaking of this symmetry generates global strings that decay predominantly via the emission of massive axions and gravitational waves. In this work, we investigate the decay of cosmic axion strings in the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole and estimate the corresponding energy losses and decay timescales of the resulting string loops. For primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses as small as $10^{-16} M_\odot$, the total energy radiated by the contracting strings is found to be on the order of $10^{27} \, \mathrm{GeV}$, accounting for both axion and gravitational radiation. Our analysis shows that the presence of a central black hole considerably accelerates string loop decay, leading to significantly reduced lifetimes. These results constitute an initial exploration of whether axion radiation from PBH-cosmic string systems could provide a non-negligible contribution to the dark matter content of galactic halos. The study also identifies the decay time as a potentially valuable observational signature. Further detailed modeling will be necessary to assess the cosmological implications of this mechanism more precisely.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evaporation of Primordial Black Holes in a Thermal Universe: A Thermofield Dynamics Approach</a><span class="id">[2512.07284]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of a finite temperature environment on the Hawking radiation from black holes (BHs), with particular focus on Kerr BHs immersed in a cosmological thermal bath.

By employing the methods of Thermofield Dynamics (TFD), a real time formalism of thermal quantum field theory, we derive the modified occupation numbers of the Hawking spectrum for asymptotically flat spacetimes like the Schwarzschild and the Kerr geometries. These corrections depend on the interplay between the BH temperature and the ambient bath temperature. We apply this formalism in the early universe reheating background scenario arising after inflation and demonstrate that the thermal correction to Hawking spectrum enhances the evaporation rate of primordial black holes (PBHs).

We conservatively estimate these events occur a few times per year within $z\leq 3$. Significant disruption of the WD occurs when the impact parameter is comparable to the WD's radius. We derive a mathematical criterion and confirm numerically by hydrodynamical simulations. With the increase of the impact parameter and the collision speed, the WD material captured by the sBH decreases while the material remain self-gravitating increases. A part of the WD material becomes unbound from the sBH-WD system, and its mass ranges from nearly zero to $\ge 50\%$, reaching the peak value when the impact parameter is comparable to the WD's radius. We expect the subsequent capture of WD material by the sBH to produce a prompt X-ray burst (a micro-TDE), and the accretion of unbound debris onto the MBH can power a fainter, delayed optical flare. The properties of certain transient X-ray bursts observed by Einstein Probe are consistent with this micro-TDE picture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17890" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seasonal Variations of the Atmospheric Muon Neutrino Spectrum measured with IceCube</a><span class="id">[2502.17890]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study presents an energy-dependent analysis of seasonal variations in the atmospheric muon neutrino spectrum, using 11.3 years of data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory.

We focus on post-inflationary Peccei-Quinn (PQ) breaking axion models that are cosmologically safe. Recent work has shown that a greater number of such models exist. This is because the heavy quarks required for the colour anomaly can provoke a period of heavy quark domination (HQD), which, through decay, dilutes the axion abundance. In this work we show for the first time that the axion dark matter mass can be as low as $m_a\sim10^{-8}\,{\rm eV}$ for models where the heavy quarks decay via dimension 6 terms. This is achieved by allowing the mass of the heavy quarks to differ from the axion decay constant, $m_Q\neq f_a$. Consequently, the observables that would distinguish between pre- and post-inflationary PQ breaking, $m_a$ and the additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, now become indiscernible. To solve this, we propose using blue-tilted IGWs to probe HQD. In scenarios where such a blue tilt is present, the enhanced GW signal allows future interferometers to place non-trivial constraints on the parameters $m_Q$ and $f_a$, thereby complementing haloscope searches. While some degeneracies with other parameters such as $m_Q$ remain, detectors such as BBO and ET will be able to optimistically probe $f_a\gtrsim 10^{14}\,{\rm GeV}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Merger History of Clustered Primordial Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2506.11290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Primordial black hole (PBH) binaries experience strong gravitational perturbations in the case of their initial clustering, which significantly affects the dynamics of their mergers.

However, we demonstrate that the weakest mergers do contribute to the constraint on the shape of the redshift distribution not only beyond the peak of star formation, but also beyond the redshifts accessible with individually detectable sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The NANOGrav 15-year Data Set: Search for Gravitational Scattering of Pulsars by Free-Floating Objects in Interstellar Space</a><span class="id">[2507.19475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Free-floating objects (FFOs) in interstellar space$-$rogue planets, brown dwarfs, and large asteroids that are not gravitationally bound to any star$-$are expected to be ubiquitous throughout the Milky Way. Recent microlensing surveys have discovered several free-floating planets that are not bound to any known stellar systems. Additionally, three interstellar objects, namely 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3I/ATLAS, have been detected passing through our solar system on hyperbolic trajectories. In this work, we search for FFOs on hyperbolic orbits that pass near millisecond pulsars (MSPs), where their gravitational influence can induce detectable perturbations in pulse arrival times. Using the NANOGrav 15-year narrowband dataset, which contains high-precision timing data for 68 MSPs, we conduct a search for such hyperbolic scattering events between FFOs and pulsars. Although no statistically significant events were detected, this non-detection enables us to place upper limits on the number density of FFOs as a function of their mass within our local region of the Galaxy. For example, the upper limit on the number density for Jupiter-mass FFOs ($\sim 10^{-2.5} - 10^{-3.5}~M_{\odot}$) obtained from different pulsars ranges from $5.25\times10^{6}~\text{pc}^{-3}$ to $5.37\times10^{9}~\text{pc}^{-3}$, while the upper limit calculated by combining results from all the pulsars is $6.03\times10^{5}~\text{pc}^{-3}$. These results represent the first constraints on FFO population derived from pulsar timing data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Phantom Divide Crossing with Standard and Negative Quintessence</a><span class="id">[2508.00621]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic microwave background data from the {\it Planck} satellite, combined with baryon acoustic oscillation measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and Type Ia supernovae from various samples, provide hints of dynamical dark energy (DE). These results indicate a peak in the DE density around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, with the highest significance observed when using the supernovae from the Dark Energy Survey. In this {\it Letter}, we show that this peak does not necessarily imply a true crossing of the phantom divide if the measured effective DE is not a single component, but a combination of standard and negative quintessence. The latter is characterized by negative energy density and positive pressure, both decreasing in absolute value and tending to 0 in the future. For appropriate values of the parameters, negative quintessence is relevant at intermediate redshifts and becomes subdominant in front of standard quintessence around $z\sim 0.4-0.5$, giving rise to the aforementioned peak in the DE density. We find that our model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at a $3.26\sigma$ CL, which is comparable to the level of exclusion found with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization. Our analysis leaves open the possibility of negative quintessence and other exotic fields existing in the low-energy universe, potentially playing a significant role in cosmic dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17003" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disformal interactions in the Dark Sector: From driving Early Dark Energy to confronting cosmological tensions</a><span class="id">[2508.17003]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $\Lambda$CDM model faces significant challenges, including an incomplete understanding of the dark sector and persistent tensions in the Hubble constant and the clustering amplitude. To address these issues, we propose a general disformal coupling between dark energy (DE) and dark matter from a field-theoretic action which can generate a rich variety of interactions including conformal and pure-momentum coupling scenarios. Our analysis reveals that a pure disformal coupling naturally produces a unique interacting Early Dark Sector, wherein the interactions with dark matter suppress the Hubble friction on the DE scalar field leading to a kinetic-driven cosmological constant-like behavior at early times followed by its dilution as $a^{-6}$ and eventually leading to a potential-driven epoch characteristic of late-time dark energy. In contrast to existing Early Dark Energy (EDE) models that rely on finely-tuned potentials, the EDE-like behavior, in our framework, is purely a consequence of the disformal coupling paired with the dilution of dark matter, offering a more fundamental and less ad hoc solution to cosmological tensions. This framework also predicts a suppression of power in the CMB temperature spectrum on large angular scales, offering a potential physical explanation for the observed low-$\ell$ anomaly. By deriving these effects from a fundamental action, our work provides a unified, testable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM that can be constrained by next-generation cosmological surveys and gravitational wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01663" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasi-Periodic Eruptions as a Probe of Accretion Disk in Tidal Disruption Events</a><span class="id">[2509.01663]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are X-ray transients characterized by nearly regular recurring flares from galactic nuclei. Recent observations have confirmed that some QPEs occur in galactic centers that experienced a tidal disruption event (TDE) a few years earlier. This may be reasonably explained if QPEs are produced when a star orbiting a supermassive black hole passes through an accretion disk formed by the TDE. Based on this scenario, we investigate the expected QPE signatures in the early stages of TDEs, taking into account the time evolution of the accretion disk. In the early phase, the disk is in a super-Eddington accretion state. The interaction between the star and such a slim disk results in QPEs with durations of $\sim 100-1000\,{\rm s}$ and temperatures of $\sim 1-100\,{\rm keV}$, which are significantly shorter and hotter than those of the currently detected QPE population. These events are detectable with current X-ray telescopes, but their small duty cycle ($\lesssim1\,\%$) and the potential presence of a massive disk wind may make detection challenging. We encourage early-time and long-term monitoring TDEs showing X-rays to capture these QPEs, as such detections would provide valuable insights into the disk formation process in TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The role of peculiar velocity uncertainties in standard siren cosmology</a><span class="id">[2509.03101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Local distance indicators such as standard sirens, in combination with spectroscopic redshift measurements of their host galaxies, allow us to estimate the present-day expansion rate of the Universe parameterised by Hubble's constant, H_0. However, these observed redshifts are systematically modified by the effect of galaxy peculiar velocities. Although these velocities may be estimated from the local density field by the process of velocity-field reconstruction, the intrinsic errors and covariance in these estimates contribute to the error in the H_0 determination. In this paper we demonstrate how the impact of peculiar velocities can be propagated into H_0 measurements from local distance indicators with observed redshifts, incorporating the full covariance of the velocity field induced by bulk flows. We apply our methods to cosmological simulations, testing the importance of this effect in the context of future analyses of gravitational wave sources with electromagnetic counterparts used as bright sirens. We conclude that H_0 errors may be increased by a factor of 2 in comparison with neglecting peculiar velocity covariance, for GW170817-like sirens located within 50 Mpc with 5% distance errors, with the highest impacts expected for sources at nearby distances or with small distance errors. Our analytical methods may also be applied to other local distance indicators, such as Type Ia supernovae.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic White Dwarf - M Dwarf Binaries in Pre-mCV Phase as Special Population of Long-Period Radio Transients</a><span class="id">[2509.09224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long-period radio transients (LPTs) are a new class of coherent radio sources with periods ranging from minutes to hours. Recently, two LPT sources, ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704-37, with periods of 2-3 hours has been confirmed to originate from white dwarf (WD) – M dwarf (MD) binaries. In this work, we propose that at least some LPTs originate from the magnetic WD – MD binaries in the pre-magnetic cataclysmic variables (pre-mCV) phase. The asynchronism between the WD's rotation and the binary's orbital motion allows for the unipolar-inductor mechanism or magnetosphere interaction to operate and accelerate radiating particles, with the dominant process depending on the magnetic moment ratio of the two stars. Under asynchronism condition, both the peak flux and the polarization of radio pulses will be modulated by the beat period. The pre-mCV phase characterized by an extremely low accretion rate provides the relatively clean magnetospheric environment necessary for a loss-cone-driven maser (LCDM) mechanism to operate, producing the LPT emission. The observed pulse duty cycle of $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ is attributed to a beaming effect modulated by the binary's magnetic geometry. Furthermore, the magnetized environment of a WD–MD binary is conducive to Faraday conversion with weak coupling, which implies that the polarization state of LPTs should vary significantly at different periods. Finally, we predict that LPTs from WD–MD binaries should exhibit a period distribution following $f_P(P)dP \propto P^{(1.67-2.33)}dP$ and a luminosity function described by $f_L(L)dL \propto L^{-(1.80-2.67)}dL$, which can be tested by the future large sample.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Short Introduction to Cosmology and its Current Status</a><span class="id">[2509.12121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current cosmological model, known as the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter model (or $\Lambda$CDM for short) is one of the most astonishing accomplishments of contemporary theoretical physics.

They are distinguished by luminosities below and above the RGB tip, respectively. These systems host a stable, dusty circumbinary disc, characterised by a near-infrared excess. Observed Galactic post-AGB and post-RGB binaries have orbital periods and eccentricities inconsistent with binary population synthesis models. Here, we focus on post-RGB binaries, testing whether stable mass transfer can explain their orbital periods by comparing models with the known sample of 38 Galactic post-RGB binaries. We systematically determined luminosities of Galactic post-RGB and post-AGB binaries through SED fitting. We computed evolution models for low- and intermediate-mass binaries with RGB donors at two metallicities using MESA. We selected stable mass transfer models producing primaries with effective temperatures within the observed range. From these models, we find that low-mass post-RGB binaries should follow strict luminosity-orbital period relations. The Galactic post-RGB binaries seem consistent with these relations if their orbits remained eccentric during mass transfer and if the donor filled its Roche lobe at periastron. However, our models are unable to explain the eccentricities themselves. Moreover, post-mass-transfer ages from our models are much longer than predicted dissipation timescales of circumbinary discs. Stable mass transfer seems to explain the orbital periods of Galactic post-RGB binaries. This formation channel can be tested further by obtaining orbits of additional Galactic systems and Magellanic Cloud candidates via long-term radial velocity monitoring. Gaia DR 4 will improve luminosities of Galactic post-RGB binaries, enabling more accurate comparison with luminosity-orbital period relations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inferring Cosmological Parameters with Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks</a><span class="id">[2509.24327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the use of a novel variant of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to predict cosmological parameters from recent supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) datasets.

In our fiducial neutron-star merger model, the cosmic ray flux above $25$ EeV is dominated by ten nearby galaxies within $8\,$Mpc.

The method applies Fourier analysis to the annual SILSO SSN record, from 1700.5 to 2023.5, to identify in the spectrum, four strong components in the decadal, 10 to 11 year period, range and four weaker components in the octal, 8 to 9 year period, range. The time variation of each component is isolated by a new method of narrow band pass filtering. The components are fitted with sinusoids at the beginning/end of the SSN record for back/forward projection. Back projection successfully replicated the long term features of the Maunder Minimum. Forward projection predicts a Maunder-like grand minimum from 2030 to 2110, encompassing solar cycles 26 to 35. Details of short term features of SSN within the grand minimum are less certain. The octal contribution to SSN is shown to occasionally exceed the decadal contribution both in the projection and also within the observational record. Predicted SSN amplitudes for cycles 26 and 28 are about 50, about half the amplitude of cycles 24 and 25. The amplitude of cycle 27 is difficult to forecast as it may emerge as a double peak of cycle 26 rather than as two separate cycles 26 and 27. Amplitudes forecast for cycles 29 to 33 are, on average, about half the amplitude of cycles 26 and 27 with the lowest cycle of the grand minimum, cycle 30, occurring around 2070. Interference between the octal and decadal components evident in the SSN spectrum are shown to result in micro changes in SSN such as the Waldmeier Effect. Inter group results in the occurrence of grand solar minima and maxima. Intra component group interference results in long term variation grand maxima/minima patterns that may relate to the occurrence of long term climate variability.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assessing the Distance for Probing the Nuclear Equation of State with Supernova Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.15102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational waves from core-collapse supernovae provide a unique probe of the equation of state (EOS) of high density matter.

Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatial Phonons: A Phenomenological Viscous Dark Energy Model for DESI</a><span class="id">[2512.00056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore a phenomenological model of dark energy in which space is treated as an elastic brane with uniform tension $T_s$ supporting a longitudinal phonon fluid. The brane tension gives a residual geometric contribution to the vacuum energy, while the phonon sector is described by three scalar fields $\phi^I$ and an invariant $b = \sqrt{\det B_{IJ}}$ entering an effective action $F(b)$. At the background level this reproduces a perfect fluid with energy density, pressure and bulk modulus set by two dimensionless parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\kappa$. These parameters fix the enthalpy and bulk modulus in units of the space tension and determine the phonon sound speed through $c_s^2 = \kappa/\varepsilon$. Dissipative effects are modeled by a bulk viscous pressure obeying a Maxwell type relaxation law with a characteristic time scale $\tau(H)$ that depends on the Hubble rate. Motivated by a Boltzmann suppressed scattering rate at a mass-gap scale $H_\star$, we adopt a simple ansatz for $H\tau(H)$ and obtain a compact expression for the effective dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}(H)$. The viscous correction is transient, is most active around $H \sim H_\star$ and drives a temporary phantom deviation. At the same time, we also show that $w_{\rm eff}$ approaches $-1 + \varepsilon$ at very early and very late times. Using a flat $\Lambda$CDM background for $H(z)$, we scan the parameter space and identify a region with $\kappa \ \simeq \ \varepsilon \ \simeq \ 1/3$ and $H_\star/H_0 \ \simeq \ 2.1$. This choice gives an ultralight phonon with sound speed close to the causal limit and a viscous dark energy history $w_{\rm eff}(z)$ that closely tracks a DESI motivated Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization over the redshift range most relevant for the DESI BAO measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OASIS Survey Direct Imaging and Astrometric Discovery of HIP 71618 B: A Substellar Companion Suitable for the Roman Coronagraph Technology Demonstration</a><span class="id">[2512.02126]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the OASIS survey program discovery of a substellar companion orbiting the young A1V star HIP 71618, detected using precision astrometry from Gaia and Hipparcos and high-contrast imaging with SCExAO/CHARIS and Keck/NIRC2.

The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuclear Production and Analytic Attenuation of Energetic MeV Solar Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2408.12448]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a solar production mechanism of MeV dark matter to overcome the energy threshold in direct detection experiments.

Notably, several particle physics models predict the existence of current-carrying DWs, which can capture and store particles as zero modes on it. In this study, we demonstrate that gravitational waves (GWs) generated by current-carrying DWs with fermionic zeromodes exhibit a novel feature: an additional peak in the GW spectrum resembling mountains, arising from metastable topological remnants, which we term “spherons.” This distinct signature could be detectable in upcoming GW observatories such as LISA and ET. The results suggest that DW networks in beyond Standard Model scenarios could emit GW signals that are significantly stronger and with greater detectability than previously expected.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational lensing by non-self-intersecting vortons</a><span class="id">[2503.11025]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the gravitational lensing signatures of vorton configurations, considering the circular vorton, the Kibble-Turok vorton, and a newly proposed class that incorporates simultaneous excitations of the first, second, and third harmonic modes. Working within the weak-field and thin-lens approximations, we demonstrate that circular vortons produce a sharp lensing discontinuity that separates two regions with qualitatively distinct distortions. The corresponding Einstein ring co-exists alongside an almost undistorted source image. This effect is significantly amplified in the case of non-circular vortons, where asymmetries and higher-harmonic deformations amplify the discontinuity and lead to complex image structures. These distinctive lensing patterns offer potential discriminants between different vorton configurations, suggesting that future high-resolution surveys may provide a novel window into the microphysics of current-carrying cosmic strings.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axion forces in axion backgrounds</a><span class="id">[2504.00104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions can naturally be very light due to the protection of an (approximate) shift symmetry. Because of their pseudoscalar nature, the long-range force mediated by the axion at tree level is spin dependent, which cannot lead to observable effects between two unpolarized macroscopic objects. At the one-loop level, however, the exchange of two axions does mediate a spin-independent force. This force is coherently enhanced in the presence of an axion background. In this work, we study the two-axion exchange force in a generic axion background. We find that the breaking of the axion shift symmetry plays a crucial role in determining this force. The background-induced axion force $V_{\rm bkg}$ vanishes in the shift-symmetry restoration limit. The shift symmetry can be broken either explicitly by non-perturbative effects or effectively by the axion background. When the shift symmetry is broken, $V_{\rm bkg}$ scales as $1/r$ and could be further enhanced by a large occupation number of the background axions. We investigate possible experimental probes of this effect in two distinct scenarios: an axion dark matter background and a solar axion flux, using fifth-force searches and atomic spectroscopy experiments. In the axion dark matter case, we find that the background-induced axion force can place strong constraints on axion couplings and masses, comparable to existing astrophysical bounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights into the highest natural scale: Finite naturalness challenges inflationary dynamics</a><span class="id">[2504.17846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We apply the criterion of finite naturalness to the limiting case of a generic heavy sector decoupled from the Standard Model. The sole and unavoidable exception to this decoupling arises from gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that gravity can couple the Higgs to the heavy scale significantly earlier than the well-known three-loop top-quark-mediated diagrams discussed in previous literature. As an application, we show that finite naturalness disfavors large-field inflationary models involving super-Planckian field excursions. In contrast, in the small-field regime, achieving successful inflation requires substantial fine-tuning of the initial conditions, in agreement with previous results. Recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope further amplify the tension between naturalness and fine-tuning, challenging the theoretical robustness of single-field inflation as a compelling explanation for the origin of the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">105.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Walker in the Early Universe: A Strongly Coupled Sector Model</a><span class="id">[2507.06454]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the phenomenology of the “Dark Walker” – an $\text{SU}(3)$ theory with eight flavors of massless fundamental fermions in the dark sector.

In our population inference analysis, instead of only using events above a sharp cut based on a particular detection threshold (e.g., false alarm rate), we use a Bayesian framework to consistently include both marginal and confident events. We find that our inference based solely on highly significant events ($p_{\mathrm{astro}} \sim 1$) is broadly consistent with the GWTC-3 population analysis performed by the LVK collaboration. However, incorporating marginal events into the analysis leads to a preference for stronger redshift evolution in the merger rate and an increased density of asymmetric mass-ratio mergers relative to the GWTC-3 analysis, while remaining within its allowed parameter ranges. Using simple parametric models to describe the binary black hole population, we estimate a merger rate density of $32.4^{+18.5}_{-12.2}\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at redshift $z = 0.2$, and a redshift evolution parameter of $\kappa = 4.4^{+1.9}_{-2.0}$. Assuming a power-law form for the mass ratio distribution ($\propto q^{\beta}$), we infer $\beta = 0.1^{+1.9}_{-1.4}$, indicating a relatively flat distribution. These results highlight the potential impact of marginal events on population inferences and motivate future analyses with data from upcoming observing runs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">107.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sterile neutrino dark matter from a TeV Scale Seesaw</a><span class="id">[2510.07433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this article, we investigate the phenomenological aspects of a feebly interacting sterile neutrino dark matter candidate within a low-scale seesaw framework. The Type-I seesaw model is augmented by a second complex scalar doublet ($\Phi_{\nu}$), which couples exclusively to the heavy right-handed neutrinos and the lepton doublet, thereby generating the neutrino Dirac mass term while the first scalar doublet is responsible for giving mass to the remaining Standard Model particles. The lightest sterile neutrino ($N_1$) acts as a feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP), produced via decays of $W^\pm$, $Z$ and extra scalars present in the setup. We point out that $W^\pm$ and $Z$ contributions were overlooked in the previous studies, which actually dominate the $N_1$ production by a factor of $\sim 10^{13}$ and solely determines the relic abundance. Incorporating them leads to several novel consequences for the DM phenomenology like a new non-thermal condition which leads to smaller Yukawa couplings. We thoroughly discuss about the enhancement possibilities of $N_1$'s mass which is controlled by the small vacuum expectation value ($v_{\nu}$) of the second Higgs doublet. After incorporating the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations, this setup can accommodate both warm and cold dark matter scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">108.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2511.21488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">109.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23447" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Klein Bottle Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.23447]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore a higher-dimensional universe that is a product of Minkowski space and the non-orientable Klein Bottle. The topology explicitly breaks important symmetries, such as translational invariance and (5+1)-dimensional CP invariance. Somewhat surprisingly, the (3+1)-dimensional cp of the Minkowski space can also be broken by the Klein Bottle, both explicitly and in the presence of a brane. The topology enforces a background of fermion correlations that amounts to a condensate wall localized in the Klein Bottle. The wall acts as an order parameter for the broken symmetries. If a brane passes through the wall, brane fermions that couple to the condensate are produced as quantified by the Bogoliubov coefficients for a time-dependent mass. The scenario meets the conditions, including cp violation, to potentially generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">110.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02714" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasinormal modes of a static black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics</a><span class="id">[2512.02714]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti–de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Plebański type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington–Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev–Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $\beta$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $\beta$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $\omega_R$ and the damping rate $-\omega_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $\beta$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($\omega_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">111.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popcorn EMRIs: Transient Gravitational Wave Signals and Their Analysis in Schwartz Space</a><span class="id">[2512.04167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with orbital periods exceeding the observational timescale of mHz gravitational wave observatories. In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals “popcorn EMRIs.” We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P&gt;1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology. We establish an analytical foundation using standard smoothing techniques commonly used in real analysis. This yields the mathematically correct definition for the Fourier transform of transient signals, justifying the use of the direct Fourier transform without ad hoc windowing and ensuring the integrity of spectral analysis.</p></div></details></article></body>
