We introduce a novel, cosmology-independent method to measure the halo occupation distribution (HOD) by combining a state-of-the-art group catalog with weak gravitational lensing. For groups binned by total luminosity, we determine the galaxy occupation number $N_{\rm gal}$ from group-galaxy cross-correlations, while weak lensing constrains the average halo mass $M_h$. Applying this to a volume-limited sample at $z{\in}[0.05,0.2]$, we measure the dependence of HOD, $N_{\rm gal}(M_h)$, on large-scale overdensity $\delta_{g}$. Focusing on the satellite galaxies, we find an assembly bias parameter of $Q_{\rm sat}{=}0.05{\pm}0.14$, a result consistent with zero and in tension with many empirical galaxy formation models. Our method provides a robust approach for characterizing galaxy assembly bias to achieve precision cosmology with DESI and future Stage-V surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20897" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Positive AGN Feedback Enhances Star Formation in Starburst Dwarf Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.20897]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in dwarf galaxies remains poorly understood, with conventional wisdom suggesting it primarily suppresses star formation. Using high-resolution MACER3D simulations that directly resolve the Bondi radius, we demonstrate that AGN feedback can significantly enhance rather than suppress star formation in starburst dwarf galaxies. Our simulations reveal that AGN feedback increases global star formation rates by approximately 25% when comparing our models with both AGN and supernova feedback to those with only supernova feedback. This enhancement occurs through AGN-driven outflows creating compressed gas regions where efficient cooling preserves the high density while quickly radiating away thermal energy, creating ideal conditions for star formation. This positive feedback mechanism operates in gas-rich starburst environments with efficient cooling and moderate AGN energy input that compresses gas without expelling it from the galaxy. Critically, it requires both AGN and supernova feedback working in concert: without SN feedback to regulate black hole activity, AGN outflows become too powerful and expel gas rather than compress it. Our results closely match observations of the starburst dwarf galaxy Henize 2-10, where similar shock-compressed regions of enhanced star formation have been observed. These findings challenge conventional understanding of AGN feedback and suggest that AGN may play a previously unrecognized role in accelerating star formation during active phases of dwarf galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</a><span class="id">[2510.20898]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20899" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic clumping of charged dust in the dense interstellar medium</a><span class="id">[2510.20899]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context: Dust grains undergo significant growth in star-forming environments, especially in dense regions prone to gravitational collapse. Although dust is generally assumed to represent $1 \%$ of the gas mass, dust density variations are expected on small scales due to differential dynamics with the gas, leading to enhanced coagulation rates in regions of dust enrichment. Aims: We aim to investigate the clumping of charged dust in the turbulent magnetized dense regions of the interstellar medium. Methods: We develop a dusty model that goes beyond the standard non-ideal MHD and use the code {\ttfamily shark} to perform multifluid 1D simulations of a single size charged dust species and neutral gas with large scale driven turbulence and including ion-neutral friction. Results: We identify a mechanism similar to the parametric instability that efficiently forms dust clumps even in presence of dissipative processes. Such strong clumping survives and is sustained when driving turbulence, and thus high levels of dust concentration are produced due to compressive magnetic effects in regions of shocks. Dust density enhancements are favored by a high transverse-to-longitudinal magnetic ratio which is controlled by: transverse Mach number and plasma parameter. We find that a substantial fraction of dust experiences a density increase of more than a factor of 10 under reasonable conditions, thus promoting dust growth. Conclusion: Our novel dusty non-ideal MHD model shows that dust grains (main charge carriers) are subject to small-scale compressive magnetic effects driven by a parametric instability - like mechanism in regions of shocks, and consequently experience high density enhancements in turbulent environments that go beyond those permitted by pure hydrodynamical processes, making in-situ formation of large grains (sub-mm) in protostellar envelopes a plausible scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20912" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical modeling of aminoketene, ethanolamine, and glycine production in interstellar ices</a><span class="id">[2510.20912]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Icy interstellar dust grains are a source of complex organic molecule (COM) production, although their formation mechanisms are debated. Laboratory experiments show that atomic C deposited onto interstellar ice analogs can react with solid-phase NH3 to form a CHNH2 radical, a possible precursor to COMs, including aminoketene (NH2CHCO). We used astrochemical kinetics models to explore the role of the reaction of atomic C with NH3 and subsequent reaction with CO in the formation of NH2CHCO and other COMs. We applied the three-phase chemical model MAGICKAL to hot molecular core conditions from the cold-collapse through to the hot-core stage. The chemical network was extended to include NH2CHCO and a range of associated gas-phase, grain-surface, and bulk-ice products and reactions. We also approximated conditions in a shocked cloud, including sputtering of ice mantles. NH2CHCO is formed on grains at low temperatures ( 10 K) with a peak solid-phase abundance of  2x10^-10 nH. Its formation is driven by nondiffusive reactions, in particular the Eley-Rideal reaction of C with surface NH3, followed by immediate reaction with CO. Surface hydrogenation of NH2CHCO produces ethanolamine with a significant abundance of  8x10^-8 nH. In the gas-phase, although ethanolamine reaches a modest abundance peak immediately following its desorption from grains under hot-core conditions, it is destroyed more rapidly due to its high proton affinity. Molecular survival is much higher in the shocked regions, where these species seem most likely to be detected. NH2CHCO is produced efficiently on simulated interstellar grain surfaces, acting subsequently as an important precursor to more complex organics, including ethanolamine and glycine. Ion-molecule gas-phase destruction of NH3-bearing COMs is less efficient in shocked lower-density regions, in contrast to hot cores, enhancing their abundances and lifetimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPHEREx: Aromatics, Aliphatics and PAH Size across the Iris Nebula</a><span class="id">[2510.20919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations by the SpectroPhotometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) are combined with Spitzer spectral map data to study the aromatic, aliphatic, and PAH size evolution across the northwest photo-dissociation region (PDR) of the Iris Nebula (NGC7023). The 3.3-3.4 $\mu$m complex (I$_{3.3}$) and 11.2 $\mu$m (I$_{11.2}$) PAH band strength are determined through direct integration. In addition, the former is decomposed into a 3.3 (I'$_{3.3}$) and 3.4 $\mu$m (I'$_{3.4}$) sub-feature by fitting SPHEREx bandpass-integrated photometry using a modeled, highly sampled, multi-component spectrum. I$_{3.3}$, I$_{11.2}$, I'$_{3.3}$, and I'$_{3.4}$ all peak at the PDR. The NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database is used to obtain the average number of carbon atoms ($\overline{\rm N_{C}}$) and small PAH fraction ($f_{\rm small}$) by fitting the isolated PAH component of the Spitzer segment; $70\lesssim\overline{N_{C}}\lesssim76$ and $0.24\lesssim\text{f}_{\rm small}\lesssim0.36$. I'$_{3.4}$/I'$_{3.4}$, I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$, $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$, and $f_{\rm small}$ all show a demarcation that matches the large-scale morphology of the region. For I'$_{3.3}$ and I'$_{3.4}$ this is reflected by two distinct trends when plotted against each other, one associated with the dense, the other with the diffuse medium; $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm dense}$ = 0.49$\pm$0.01 and $[N_{\rm H,ali}/N_{\rm H,aro}]_{\rm diffuse}$ = 0.090$\pm$0.005. $\overline{\rm N_{C}}$ and $f_{\rm small}$ are tentatively correlated with I$_{11.2}$/I$_{3.3}$ (R=0.53$\pm$0.04 and -0.45$\pm$0.04, respectively). A wider variety of large(r) extended interstellar medium objects is required to tighten the correlations, turn them into quantitative calibrators for PAH size, and pin down the discrepancy of correlations with I'$_{3.3}$ involved.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). XL. The Morphological Classification of Virgo Cluster Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.20944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of morphologies, based on deep $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}z^{\prime}$ imaging of the Virgo Cluster from the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), for 3689 Virgo cluster members spanning a mass range of $\sim$$10^{11}M_{\odot}$ to $\sim$$10^5~M_{\odot}$. Our analysis introduces a new, two-component visual classification scheme developed to capture the morphological diversity of galaxies over more than six orders of magnitude in stellar mass. Our morphological classifications use two parameters to describe the global structure and star formation activity of each galaxy. Structural sub-codes denote features such as spiral arms, bars, disks, shells, streams, while star formation sub-codes indicate the form and location of the current star formation activity (e.g., in cores, clumps, filaments, etc). These visual classifications rely on deep $g^\prime$-band images, supplemented by $u^{*}g^{\prime}i^{\prime}$ color images, as well as unsharp-masked images for a subset of objects. We compare our classifications to previous results for bright member galaxies that used more established schemes, finding good agreement. We also measure quantitative classification statistics (e.g., CASGM$_{20}$) for a subset of the brighter galaxies, and present catalogs for some galaxy types of special interest, including structurally compact galaxies, ultra-diffuse galaxies, candidate ultra-compact dwarf transition objects, as well as candidate post-merger systems. These morphological classifications may be useful as a training set in the application of machine learning tools to the next generation of wide-field imaging surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectroscopic Classification of Extragalactic Transients from CRTS</a><span class="id">[2510.20989]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000 transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN 2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than 200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220 that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supernovae Driven Winds Impede Lyman Continuum Escape from Dwarf Galaxies in First 10 Myr</a><span class="id">[2510.21197]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations suggest that UV-bright, compact star-forming galaxies produce enough ionizing (Lyman continuum; LyC) photons to reionize the Universe. Yet, the efficiency of LyC escape and the roles of radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae remain uncertain. Using medium-resolution spectra of six nearly identical local star-forming galaxies, we directly trace, for the first time, the evolution of a multiphase wind through individual spectral lines alongside measurements of the LyC escape fraction. We find that LyC escape peaks early, during a period dominated by intense radiation and stellar winds but lacking a fast galactic wind. As the starbursts age, supernovae drive and accelerate the wind, progressively suppressing LyC escape. These results highlight the need for cosmological simulations to incorporate early feedback as a key driver of reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling the scattering by porous aggregate dust grains in the Far-Ultraviolet halos of Spica and Achernar</a><span class="id">[2510.21212]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) halos have been detected around six bright stars by Murthy and Henry (2011) using GALEX observations. These halos are thought to be caused by forward scattering of the starlight by dust grains present in thin foreground clouds. The optical constants of grains producing such halos have been constrained earlier by using a single scattering model, that considered the Henyey-Greenstein empirical phase function instead of theoretical phase functions for the scattering grains. In this work, we have modelled the FUV halos for two stars, Spica and Achernar, by considering the realistic porous aggregates of different sizes and compositions. As the Henyey-Greenstein phase function is known to deviate from theoretical predictions, we have utilized theoretical scattering phase functions for modelling. The dust is placed in a double-layered plane-parallel sheet with its distance and optical depth varied to get the best fit. We find that the halo intensities are dominated by scattering due to 0.05 {\mu}m sized porous dust aggregates made of amorphous silicate and carbonaceous aggregates for Spica and Achernar, respectively. We find that the medium in front of Achernar has a lower optical depth ({\tau}) of 0.032 compared to Spica which has a value of {\tau} = 0.1. This low value is close to the optical depth of the local ISM (0.01) within 40 pc of the Sun. This study demonstrates an effective method to constrain the dust grain properties in the local interstellar medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The relation between the optical variability timescale, magnetic field of jets and black hole spin in active galactic nuclei</a><span class="id">[2510.21263]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW) model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field ($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass, expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21377" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminosity-Dependent Assembly Bias of Central Galaxies from Weak Lensing and Clustering</a><span class="id">[2510.21377]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Assembly bias, which is the variation in halo clustering at fixed mass driven by formation history, has long been predicted by numerical simulations but remains difficult to confirm observationally. In this work, we present one of the first direct observational tests of luminosity-dependent assembly bias using a large sample of galaxy clusters with spectroscopically confirmed brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs). Combining galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering measurements, we find evidence for assembly bias: brighter BCGs reside in more concentrated halos yet are less strongly clustered on large scales, yielding a relative bias ratio deviating from the unity at about the $3\sigma$ level. Our findings are further supported by the FLAMINGO and MillenniumTNG hydrodynamical simulations, in which we directly detect assembly bias signals consistent with the observations, thereby confirming the connection between galaxy luminosity and halo formation history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AGN STORM 2. XI. Spectroscopic reverberation mapping of the hot dust in Mrk 817</a><span class="id">[2510.21395]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (STORM 2) campaign targeted Mrk 817 with intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and found its soft X-ray emission to be strongly absorbed. We present results from 157 near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of $\sim 90$ light-days from the blackbody dust temperature light-curve. This radius is consistent with previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition. Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident radiation, we derive a luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate of $\dot{m} \sim 0.2$. Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured lower luminosity disk with $\dot{m} \sim 0.1$, which permits the UV/optical continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on scales $&gt; 140-350$ pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we observe in spatially-resolved [SIII] $\lambda 9531$ images. Its likely origin is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by a nuclear starburst.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of a giant radio outburst of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy SDSS J110546.07+145202.4</a><span class="id">[2510.21500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have identified a high-amplitude radio outburst in the course of a large-sample study of the radio properties of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies.

We have also searched for signs of variability in the infrared and optical bands using archival data. We report the discovery of a rare high-amplitude radio outburst of a NLS1 galaxy, SDSS J110546.07+145202.4, with an amplitude of a factor of &gt;20 at centimetre wavelengths within 18 yr, and remaining at high-state for at least 7.6 yr. Thus, the object transitioned to a radio-loud state with a radio-loudness parameter exceeding 150. The radio spectrum measured at gigahertz frequencies during the 2020s is flat. We did not find indications of a similar increase in brightness in optical surveys or in the infrared measurements of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer.

The relative contributions of binary supernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway origin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way. We aim to characterize the largest sample of Galactic O-type runaway stars ever investigated through their kinematics, rotation, and binarity to shed light into their origins. We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic information to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational velocities ($v \sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional information about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic binary nature. We also consider an additional sample of 65 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries. We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type runaways, most (74%) have $v \sin{i}&lt;200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this fraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast rotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal stars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate faster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast rotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS dominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach runaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step products. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that most Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS among fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity ones.

With the number of known double relics growing in recent and upcoming radio surveys, statistical analyses of their properties are becoming feasible. In this study, we utilize the cosmological magnetohydrodynamics zoom-in simulations TNG-Cluster, in combination with TNG300-1, to examine the statistical properties of double radio relics. The simulated double relic pairs exhibit a wide range of luminosity ratios, broadly consistent with the observations. We find that the two relics in a given double system often differ significantly in their shock properties and magnetic field strengths. This diversity implies that the observed brightness asymmetry in the pair cannot be explained by a single factor alone, but instead reflects an interplay of multiple physical parameters. Nevertheless, double radio relics tend to align with the collision axis within $\sim30^{\circ}$ and their separation ($d_{\rm drr}$) correlates tightly with the time since collision (TSC) as ${\rm TSC~[Gyr]} = 0.52 d_{\rm drr}/R_{500\rm c} - 0.24$, allowing it to be inferred with an accuracy of $\sim0.2~\rm Gyr$. With the statistical samples of simulated radio relics, we predict that low-mass clusters will constitute the dominant population of double radio relic systems detected with upcoming surveys such as SKA. These results demonstrate that double radio relics can serve as robust probes of merger dynamics and plasma acceleration, and that simulations provide critical guidance for interpreting the large samples expected from next-generation radio surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To Survive or to Shatter: The Impact of Cosmic Rays on the Fate of Stripped Cold Clouds</a><span class="id">[2510.21699]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Does cosmic ray (CR) pressure matter for the circumgalactic medium (CGM)? Despite growing interest, this remains a debated question, complicated by limited observational constraints and differing implementations of CR physics in simulations. While prior studies suggest that CRs influence the thermal and dynamical state of the CGM, their role in shaping cold gas structures remains underexplored. This paper investigates how CRs affect ram-pressure stripped cold gas clouds originating from satellite galaxies in a Milky Way-like halo. Using high-resolution simulations with varying CR energy densities, we find that CRs can significantly modify the size and survival of stripped clouds. Specifically, CR pressure puffs up the cold clouds, increasing their surface area and enabling more efficient mixing-layer cooling, allowing them to grow in mass. This enhanced growth results in higher cold gas inflow rates into the central galaxy, leading to an increase in the star formation rate compared to the no-CR case at a later time. Moreover, CRs can boost the total cold gas mass in the CGM by up to a factor of four. These effects are most pronounced in simulations where the CR energy density is in equipartition with the thermal gas. Our results demonstrate that CRs can play a critical role in regulating the cold phase of the CGM contributed by satellites and therefore their ability to feed galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connecting Chemical Enrichment with Resolved Star Formation Histories</a><span class="id">[2510.21707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new framework for modeling the chemical enrichment histories of galaxies by integrating the chemical evolution with resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from color-magnitude diagrams. This novel approach links the time evolution of the metallicity of the star-forming ISM to the cumulative stellar mass formed in the galaxy, enabling a physically motivated, self-consistent description of chemical evolution. We apply this methodology to four isolated, gas-rich Local Group dwarf galaxies – WLM, Aquarius, Leo A, and Leo P – using deep HST and JWST imaging. For WLM, Aquarius, and Leo A, we independently validate our metallicity evolution results using ages and metallicities of individual red giant stars with spectroscopic measurements, finding good agreement. We quantify systematic uncertainties by repeating our analysis with multiple stellar evolution and bolometric correction libraries. We then compare the observed chemical enrichment histories to predictions from the TNG50 and FIREbox cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and the Galacticus semi-analytic model. We find that the enrichment history of WLM is best reproduced by the FIREbox simulation, while TNG50 and Galacticus predict higher metallicities at early times. Our results suggest that differences in stellar feedback and metal recycling prescriptions drive significant variation in the predicted chemical enrichment of dwarf galaxies, particularly at early times. This work demonstrates the power of combining resolved SFHs with physically motivated chemical evolution models to constrain galaxy formation physics and highlights the need for further observational and theoretical studies of metal retention and recycling in low-mass dwarf galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21709" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth, mergers, and tidal disruptions</a><span class="id">[2510.21709]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole, possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes.

Over the past few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$ framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordström (RN) BH. In its turn, for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Net-zero gas inflow: Measurement of the gas consumption history of a massive quiescent galaxy</a><span class="id">[2405.19401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST is discovering increasing numbers of quiescent galaxies 1–2 billion years after the Big Bang, whose redshift, high mass, and old stellar ages indicate that their formation and quenching were surprisingly rapid.

We present deep ALMA observations of cold molecular gas (the fuel for star formation) in a massive, fast-rotating, post-starburst galaxy at $z=3.064$. This galaxy hosts an AGN, driving neutral-gas outflows with a mass-outflow rate of $60\pm20$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and has a star-formation rate of $&lt;5.6$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Our data reveal this system to be the most distant gas-poor galaxy confirmed with direct CO observations (molecular-gas mass $&lt; 10^{9.1}$ M$_{\odot}$; &lt;0.8 % of its stellar mass). Combining ALMA and JWST observations, we estimate the gas-consumption history of this galaxy, showing that it evolved with net zero gas inflow, i.e., gas consumption by star formation matches the amount of gas this galaxy is missing relative to star-forming galaxies. This could arise both from preventive feedback stopping further gas inflow, which would otherwise refuel star formation or, alternatively, from fine-tuned ejective feedback matching precisely gas inflows. Our methods, applied to a larger sample, promise to disentangle ejective vs preventive feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation at $\sim10^{10}$ Solar masses, using forthcoming space-based imaging of galaxy-galaxy strong lenses</a><span class="id">[2501.16139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) is central to understanding the co-evolution of galaxies and their host dark matter haloes, yet it remains weakly constrained for dwarf galaxies owing to their faintness, especially beyond the Local Group. Strong gravitational lensing offers a unique probe of the SHMR at sub-galactic scales and cosmological distances, as the masses of subhalos within the main lens can be inferred from the perturbations they imprint on lensed images. Anticipating the discovery of $\sim10^5$ galaxy–galaxy strong lenses by forthcoming facilities such as \textit{Euclid}, we perform an end-to-end simulation to forecast \textit{Euclid}'s constraints on the SHMR at the halo mass scale of $\sim10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We generate mock \textit{Euclid} VIS images of lens systems hosting a fiducial $3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ subhalo and vary its properties to assess the robustness of mass inference. We find that \textit{Euclid}'s angular resolution cannot break the intrinsic mass–concentration degeneracy of subhaloes, nor deblend the light of satellite galaxies (when present) associated with them, leading to biased inferred halo masses. These limitations are overcome with high-resolution follow-up imaging from facilities such as the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope}, enabling accurate halo-mass measurements. We forecast that a statistical sample of $\sim100$ such systems, combining lensing-derived halo masses with stellar masses from photometric SED fitting, can constrain the SHMR at dwarf-galaxy scales with a precision of $\sim0.05$ dex in halo mass and $\sim0.03$ dex in stellar mass, enabling powerful tests of galaxy formation theories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tentative rotation in a galaxy at z$\sim$14 with ALMA</a><span class="id">[2503.10751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We re-analysed ALMA observations of the [OIII]$\lambda$88$\mu$m emission line in JADES-GS-z14.0, so far the most distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at z=14.18.

We performed kinematical fitting using the KinMS code and estimated a dynamical mass of log$_{10}$(M$_{\rm dyn}$/$\rm M_\odot$)= 9.4$^{+0.8}_{-0.4}$, with the bulk of the uncertainties due to the degeneracy between dynamical mass and inclination.

A probabilistic classification of quenched galaxies</a><span class="id">[2503.15315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Investigating what drives the quenching of star formation in galaxies is key to understanding their evolution. The Euclid mission will provide rich data from optical to infrared wavelengths for millions of galaxies, and enable precise measurements of their star formation histories. Using the first Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1), we developed a probabilistic classification framework that combines the average specific star-formation rate inferred over two timescales ($10^8,10^9$ yr) to categorise galaxies as `ageing' (secularly evolving), `quenched' (recently halted star formation), or `retired' (dominated by old stars). Two classification methods were employed: a probabilistic approach, which integrates posterior distributions, and a model-driven method, which optimises sample purity and completeness using IllustrisTNG. At $z&lt;0.1$ and $M_\ast \gtrsim 3\times10^{8}\,M_\odot$, we obtain Euclid class fractions of 68-72\%, 8-17\%, and 14-19\% for ageing, quenched, and retired populations, respectively. Ageing and retired galaxies dominate at the low- and high-mass end, respectively, while quenched galaxies surpass the retired fraction for $M_\ast \lesssim 10^{10}\,\rm M_\odot$. The evolution with redshift shows increasing and decreasing fractions of ageing and retired galaxies, respectively. More massive galaxies usually undergo quenching episodes at earlier times than to their low-mass counterparts. In terms of the mass-size-metallicity relation, ageing galaxies generally exhibit disc morphologies and low metallicities. Retired galaxies show compact structures and enhanced chemical enrichment, while quenched galaxies form an intermediate population that is more compact and chemically evolved than ageing systems. This work demonstrates Euclid's great potential for elucidating the physical nature of the quenching mechanisms that govern galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accurately simulating core-collapse self-interacting dark matter halos</a><span class="id">[2506.06269]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The properties of satellite halos provide a promising probe for dark matter (DM) physics. Observations have motivated current efforts to explain surprisingly compact DM halos. If DM is not collisionless, but has strong self-interactions, halos can undergo gravothermal collapse, leading to higher densities in the central region of the halo. However, it is challenging to model this collapse phase from first principles. To improve on this, we sought to better understand the numerical challenges and convergence properties of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) N-body simulations in the collapse phase. Especially, our aim was to better understand the evolution of satellite halos. To do so, we ran SIDM N-body simulations of a low-mass halo in isolation and within an external gravitational potential. The simulation set-up was motivated by the perturber of the stellar stream GD-1. We find that the halo evolution is very sensitive to energy conservation errors, and a SIDM kernel size that is too large can artificially speed up the collapse. Moreover, we demonstrate that the King model can describe the density profile at small radii for the late stages that we have simulated. Furthermore, for our most highly resolved simulation (N = 5x10^7) we have made the data public. It can serve as a benchmark. Overall, we find that the current numerical methods do not suffer from convergence problems in the late collapse phase and provide guidance on how to choose numerical parameters, for example that the energy conservation error is better kept well below 1%. This allows simulations to be run of halos that become concentrated enough to explain observations of GD-1-like stellar streams or strong gravitational lensing systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17809" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JADES: Carbon-enhanced, Nitrogen-normal compact galaxy at z=11.2</a><span class="id">[2507.17809]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past few years \textit{JWST} has been a major workhorse in detecting and constraining the metal enrichment of the first galaxies in the early Universe and finding the source of the ionisation of their interstellar medium.

We report the discovery of MPG-CR3 (Metal-Pristine Galaxy COSMOS Redshift 3; hereafter CR3), an extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z= 3.193\pm0.016$. From JWST, VLT, and Subaru observations, CR3 exhibits exceptionally strong Ly$\alpha$, H$\alpha$, and He I $\lambda$10830 emission. We measure rest-frame equivalent widths of EW$_0$(Ly$\alpha$) $=822\pm101$ Angstrom and EW$_0$(H$\alpha$) $=2814\pm327$ Angstrom, among the highest seen in star-forming systems. No metal lines, e.g. [O III] $\lambda\lambda4959,5007$, C IV $\lambda\lambda1548,1550$, have statistically significant detections, placing a 2-$\sigma$ upper limit on the gas-phase metallicity of 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.52 ($Z &lt; 7\times10^{-3}\ Z_\odot$) with strong-line calibration established by JWST, making it the most metal-poor galaxy known at cosmic noon. Considering systematic uncertainties of $\gtrsim 0.3$ dex in the calibrations, the most conservative 2-$\sigma$ upper limit is set to 12+log(O/H) &lt; 6.95. The observed Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratio is $13.9\pm2.5$, indicating negligible dust attenuation. Spectral energy distribution modeling with Pop III stellar templates indicates a very young ($\sim2$ Myr), low-mass ($M_* \approx 6.1\times 10^5 M_\odot$) stellar population. Further, the photometric redshifts reveal that CR3 could reside in a slightly underdense environment ($\delta \approx -0.12$). CR3 provides evidence that first-generation star formation could persist well after the epoch of reionization, challenging the conventional view that pristine star formation ended by $z\gtrsim6$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kinematic analysis of an Ultra-Strong MgII absorber at z 1.13 linking to Circumgalactic Gas Structures</a><span class="id">[2510.00729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a spectroscopic and imaging analysis of the $z_{gal} \approx 1.1334$ ultra-strong MgII absorption system identified in the $VLT$/UVES spectrum of a background quasar located at $\rho \approx 18$ kpc from a star-forming galaxy. Low ionization metal lines like MgI, FeII, and CaII are also detected for this absorber. The HI lines are outside of the wavelength coverage. The MgII has a rest-frame equivalent width of $W_r(2796) =3.185 +/- 0.032 A^{\circ} $, with the absorption spread across $\Delta v \approx 460$ km s$^{-1}$ in several components. A component-by-component ionization modeling shows several of these components having solar and higher metallicities. The models also predict a total HI column density of $log[N(HI)/cm^{-2}] \approx 22.5$, consistent with ultra-strong MgII absorbers being sub-Damped Lyman Alpha and Damped Lyman Alpha systems.

The absorption is along the projected major axis of the galaxy with a velocity spread that is wider than the galaxy's disk rotation. From the kinematic analysis of the absorber and the galaxy, the origin of the absorption can be attributed to a combination of circumgalactic gas structures, some corotating with the disk and the rest at line-of-sight velocities outside of the disk rotation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13974" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey.

NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18764" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking Electron Density with Elevated Star Formation Activity from $z=0$ to $z=10$</a><span class="id">[2510.18764]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift galaxies exhibits significantly higher electron densities ($n_{\rm e}$) than in the local universe. To investigate the origin of this trend, we analyze a sample of 9590 centrally star-forming galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^9\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.04$, selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. We derive electron densities from the [S II] $\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet, measuring values of $n_{\rm e} = 30$-$400~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ at $z \approx 0$. We find a tight correlation between $n_{\rm e}$ and the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), which is well described by a broken power law. Above a threshold of $\log(\Sigma_{\rm SFR} / M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}) \ge -1.46$, the relation follows $n_{\rm e} = (233 \pm 13)\,\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.49 \pm 0.02}$. Below this threshold, $n_{\rm e}$ remains approximately constant at $44 \pm 3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$. Remarkably, this relation remains consistent with measurements of galaxies at $z = 0.9$-$10.2$. By converting the observed redshift evolution of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ into $n_{\rm e}$ evolution through our $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation, we obtain $n_{\rm e} = 40(1+z)^{1.4}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, consistent with previous direct observations. The $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation likely arises because the high $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, fueled by dense cold gas or elevated efficiency, enhances radiative and mechanical feedback and produces dense ionized gas whose electron densities are further regulated by ambient pressure. We conclude that the redshift evolution of $n_{\rm e}$ primarily reflects the evolution of cold gas density and star formation activity over cosmic time.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20466" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of triaxiality on the dynamics of triple supermassive black holes in a cosmological context</a><span class="id">[2510.20466]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The hierarchical nature of galaxy formation in the $\Lambda$CDM framework often leads to multiple supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the galactic nuclei.

They operate in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively, at similar latitudes but with distinct surface detector (SD) designs. A significant challenge in studying UHECR physics across the full sky is the apparent discrepancy in flux measurements between the two experiments. This discrepancy could arise from astrophysical differences and/or systematic effects related to their detector designs and sensitivities to extensive air shower components. To address this, the Auger@TA working group aims to cross-calibrate the two observatories with a self-triggering micro-Auger array within the TA array. This micro-array consists of eight Auger Surface Detector (SD) stations equipped with Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) and AugerPrime Surface Scintillator Detectors. Seven SD stations, configured with a centered-1-PMT design, are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with one station in the center, with 1.5 km spacing, mirroring the Auger layout. The eighth station, which features a standard 3-PMT Auger station, is located in conjunction with a TA detector at the center of the hexagon, forming a triplet for high-statistics and low-uncertainty cross-calibration.

Within the light curve databases of survey missions such as Kepler and TESS are a wealth of new systems awaiting characterisation. We aim to improve the scalability of efforts to process these data by developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) machine learning model to assist in the automation of their analysis. From a phase-folded and binned dEB light curve the model predicts system parameters relating to stellar fractional radii, orbital inclination and eccentricity, and the stellar brightness ratio, for use as input values in subsequent formal analysis with the established JKTEBOP analytic code. We find the model able to predict these parameters for a previously unseen test dataset of 20000 synthetic dEB systems with a mean error of 14.1% when compared with the label values, improving to 8.6% against a subset representative of real systems. When tested with the TESS light curves of a set of real well-characterised systems, the model's predictions yield a mean error of $8.7\pm0.7\%$ when compared with label values derived from existing published analyses. Subsequent fitting of the TESS light curves with the JKTEBOP analytic code while using the model predictions as input values finds 27 of the 28 systems achieving a good fit. On the strength of these results, we plan to build a new characterisation pipeline based on the machine learning model and JKTEBOP code with the intention of producing a target catalogue of dEB systems for potential observation with the forthcoming PLATO mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEO Satellite Track Correction for CSST Multi-Band Imaging Data</a><span class="id">[2510.21510]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low Earth Orbit satellite (LEOsat) mega-constellations are considered to be an unavoidable source of contamination for survey observations to be carried out by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) over the next decade. This study reconstructs satellite trail profiles based on simulated parameters, including brightness levels and orbital altitudes, in combination with multi-band simulated images. Compared to our previous work, the simulated images in this study more accurately replicate the realistic observational conditions of CSST and extend beyond single-band analysis. Variations in LEOsat trail brightness, source brightness, background noise, and source density across different bands result in differing levels of accuracy in trail reconstruction and subsequently affect the reliability of photometric measurements. The reconstructed trail profiles are subsequently applied to correct the contaminated regions. Simulation results reveal varying levels of contamination effects across different bands following LEOsat trail correction, including both reconstruction and subtraction. To evaluate the effectiveness of the correction, we quantified the fraction of affected sources using two metrics: (1) magnitude errors greater than 0.01 mag attributable to LEOsats, and (2) LEOsat-induced noise exceeding 10% of other noise contributions. Following trail repair, the analysis reveals a reduction of over 50% in the fraction of affected sources in the NUV band for both 550 km and 1200 km altitudes, assuming a maximum brightness of 7 in the V band. In the i band, the reduction exceeds 30%. The degree of improvement varies across spectral bands, and depends on both satellite altitude and the adopted brightness model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21690" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comparing the data reduction pipelines of FRIPON, DFN, WMPL, and AMOS: Geminids Case Study</a><span class="id">[2510.21690]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Methods. We processed a dataset of 584 Geminid fireballs observed by FRIPON between 2016 and 2023. The single-station astrometric data is converted into the Global Fireball Exchange (GFE) standard format for uniform processing. We assess variations in trajectory, velocity, radiant, and orbital element calculations across the pipelines and compare them to previously published Geminid measurements. Results. The radiant and velocity solutions provided by the four data reduction pipelines are all within the range of previously published values. However, there are some nuances. Particularly, the radiants estimated by WMPL, DFN, and AMOS are nearly identical. Whereas FRIPON reports a systematic shift in right ascension (-0.3 degrees), caused by improper handling of the precession. Additionally, the FRIPON data reduction pipeline also tends to overestimate the initial velocity (+0.3 km s-1) due to the deceleration model used as the velocity solver. The FRIPON velocity method relies on having a well-constrained deceleration profile; however, for the Geminids, many are low-deceleration events, leading to an overestimation of the initial velocity. On the other end of the spectrum, the DFN tends to predict lower velocities, particularly for poorly observed events. However, this velocity shift vanishes for the DFN when we only consider Geminids with at least three observations or more. The primary difference identified in the analysis concerns the velocity uncertainties. Despite all four pipelines achieving similar residuals between their trajectories and observations, their velocity uncertainties vary systematically, with WMPL outputting the smallest values, followed by AMOS, FRIPON, and DFN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ab uno disce omnes: Single-harmonic search for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</a><span class="id">[2510.20891]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals' complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21411" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing searches for gravitational wave bursts 2 using coherent WaveBurst 2G</a><span class="id">[2510.21411]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The most general searches for gravitational wave transients (GWTs) rely on data analysis methods that do not assume prior knowledge of the signal waveform, direction, or arrival time on Earth. These searches provide data-driven signal reconstructions that are crucial both for testing available emission models and for discovering yet-to-be-uncovered sources. Here, we discuss progress in the detection performance of the coherent WaveBurst second-generation pipeline (cWB-2G), which is highly adaptable to both minimally modeled and model-informed searches for GWTs. Several search configurations for GWTs are examined using approximately 14.8 days of observation time from the third observing run by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). Recent enhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the statistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the correlations of false alarms and simulated detections between different concurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison of cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors, and we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of generic morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights for assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches for generic GWTs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TES Proton Irradiation Result Analysis for Future Space Applications</a><span class="id">[2510.21534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>As observed on the signal of the Planck-HFI highly sensitive bolometers, the effect of cosmic rays on detectors is a major concern for future similar space missions.

The amplitude of the correlation is directly related to the luminosity distribution of the star, which would be unresolved by a single telescope. This technique is based on the well-known Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect. After its discovery in the 1950s, it was used in astronomy until the 1970s, and then replaced by direct (“amplitude”) interferometry, which is much more sensitive, but also much more demanding. However, in recent years, intensity interferometry has undergone a revival.

Aims: We develop an efficient compression and evaluation framework for solar EUV data, specifically optimized for Solar Orbiter Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) data, significantly reducing data volume while preserving scientific usability. Methods: We systematically evaluated four error-bounded lossy compressors across two EUI datasets. However, the existing methods cannot perfectly handle the EUI datasets (with continuously changing distance and significant resolution differences). Motivated by this, we develop an adaptive hybrid compression strategy with optimized interpolation predictors. Moreover, we designed a two-stage evaluation framework integrating distortion analysis with downstream scientific workflows, ensuring that observational analysis is not affected at high compression ratios. Results: Our framework SolarZip achieved up to 800x reduction for Full Sun Imager (FSI) data and 500x for High Resolution Imager (HRI$_{\text{EUV}}$) data. It significantly outperformed both traditional and advanced algorithms, achieving 3-50x higher compression ratios than traditional algorithms, surpassing the second-best algorithm by up to 30%. Simulation experiments verified that SolarZip can reduce data transmission time by up to 270x while ensuring the preservation of scientific usability. Conclusions: The SolarZip framework significantly enhances solar observational data compression efficiency while preserving scientific usability by dynamically selecting optimal compression methods based on observational scenarios and user requirements. This provides a promising data management solution for deep space missions like Solar Orbiter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Pierre Auger Observatory: Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</a><span class="id">[2507.13771]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004.

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. We identified 29 previously unreported transients, 12 of which would not have been detected based on the DP1 DiaObject catalog. SLIDE will be especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey. Our pipeline is broadly applicable and will support studies of all transients with slowly evolving phases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Application of Non-Linear Noise Regression in the Virgo Detector</a><span class="id">[2410.06220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work presents the first demonstration of non-linear noise regression in the Virgo detector using deep learning techniques. We use DeepClean, a convolutional autoencoder previously shown to be effective in denoising LIGO data, as our tool for modeling and subtracting environmental and technical noise in Virgo. The method uses auxiliary witness channels to learn correlated noise features and remove them from the strain data. For this study, we apply DeepClean to Virgo O3b data, using 225 witness channels selected across 13 targeted frequency bands. Our analysis confirms the presence of non-linear couplings in the subtracted noise, highlighting the importance of DeepClean-like tools in capturing such effects. We observe up to a 1.3 Mpc improvement in the binary neutron star inspiral range ( 2.5% gain), and an average increase of 1.7% in the recovered signal-to-noise ratio for injected binary black hole signals. Parameter estimation studies further confirm that DeepClean does not introduce bias in the recovery of source parameters. These results demonstrate the robustness of DeepClean on Virgo data and support its adoption in real-time noise subtraction frameworks for future observing runs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spiking Neural Networks for Radio Frequency Interference Detection in Radio Astronomy</a><span class="id">[2412.06124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) promise efficient and dynamic spatio-temporal data processing.

While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. For certain interferometer configurations, small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies, potentially enabling broadband detection at high frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01540" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discrete Fourier Transform versus Discrete Chi-Square Method</a><span class="id">[2509.01540]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compare two time series analysis methods, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and our Discrete Chi-square Method (DCM).

The backbone of DCM is the Gauss-Markov theorem that the least squares fit is the best unbiased estimator for linear regression models. DCM is a simple numerical time series analysis method that performs a massive number of linear least squares fits. Hence, the data spacing, even or uneven, is irrelevant. We show that our numerical solution for the DCM model fulfils the three conditions of a well-posed problem: existence, uniqueness and this http URL Fisher-test is used to identify the best DCM model from all alternative tested DCM models. The correct DCM model must also pass our Predictivity-test. Our analyses of seven different simulated data samples expose the weaknesses of DFT and the efficiency of DCM. The DCM signal and trend detection depend only on the sample size and the accuracy of data. DCM is an ideal forecasting method because the time span of observations is irrelevant. If the Gauss-Markov theorem is valid, DCM can not fail.

The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [4].
