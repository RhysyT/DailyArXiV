Introducing the assumption of a dominant dark matter halo will also imply a decay timescale for the orbits in question. A self-consistency constraint hence arises, such that the resulting orbital decay timescales must be longer than the lifetimes of the systems in question. While such constraints are often trivially passed, the combined dependencies of dynamical friction timescales on the mass and orbital radius of the orbital tracer and on the density and velocity dispersion of the assumed dark matter particles leads to the existence of a number of astronomical systems where such a consistency test is failed. Here, we review cases from stars in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, galactic bars, satellite galaxies, and, particularly, the multi-period mutual orbits of the Magellanic Clouds, as recently inferred from the star formation histories of these two galaxies, as well as the nearby M81 group of galaxies, where introducing enough dark matter to explain observed kinematics leads to dynamical friction orbital decay timescales shorter than the lifetimes of the systems in question. Taken together, these observations exclude dark matter halos made of particles as plausible explanations for the observed kinematics of these systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Igniting galaxy formation in the post-reionization universe</a><span class="id">[2511.03785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is widely believed that the ultraviolet background produced during the epoch of reionization conspires against the formation of low-mass galaxies. Indeed, this mechanism is often invoked as a solution to the so-called `missing satellites problem.' In this paper we employ FIREbox, a large-volume cosmological simulation based on the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) physics model, to characterize the mechanisms governing galaxy ignition in the post-reionization era. By carefully matching recently-ignited halos (with stellar ages below $100$ Myr) to halos that failed to form any stars, we conclude that the presence of cold-dense gas and halo concentration help incite the process of galaxy formation. Concretely, we find that $100\%$ of recently-ignited halos experience cold-dense gas enhancements relative to their matched failed counterparts. Likewise, approximately $83\%$ display enhancements in both cold-dense gas and Navarro-Frenk-White concentration ($c_{\rm NFW}$), while the remaining $\sim17\%$ exhibit enhanced cold-dense gas content and suppressed $c_{\rm NFW}$ values. Lastly, our simulation suggests that galaxy ignition can occur as late as $z=2$, potentially allowing us to observationally catch this process `in the act' in the forseeable future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the dawn of galaxies: star formation and feedback in the JWST era through the GAEA model</a><span class="id">[2511.03787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telecope (JWST) opened a new window for the study of the highest redshift ($z&gt;7$) Universe. This work presents a theoretical investigation of the very-high redshift Universe using the state-of-the-art GALaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model, run on merger trees from the Planck-Millennium $N$-body simulation. We show that GAEA successfully reproduces a wide range of high-$z$ observational estimates including: the galaxy stellar mass function up to $z\sim13$ and the total (galaxies and AGN) UV luminosity function (LF) up to $z\sim10$. We find that the AGN UV emission represents an important contribution at the bright end of the UVLF up to $z\sim8$, but it is negligible at higher redshift. Our model reproduces well the observed mass-metallicity relation at $z\leq4$, while it slightly overestimates the normalization of the relation at earlier cosmic epochs. At $z\geq11$, current UVLF estimates are at least one order of magnitude larger than model predictions. We investigate the impact of different physical mechanisms, such as an enhanced star formation efficiency coupled with a reduced stellar feedback or a negligible stellar feedback at $z&gt;10$. In the framework of our model, both the galaxy stellar mass and UV luminosity functions at $z\geq10$ can be explained by assuming feedback-free starbursts in high-density molecular clouds. However, we show that this model variant leads to a slight increase of the normalization of the $z\geq10$ mass-metallicity relation, strengthening the tension with available data. A model with negligible stellar feedback at $z&gt;10$ also predicts larger numbers of massive and bright galaxies aligning well with observations, but it also overestimates the metallicity of the interstellar medium. We show that these model variants can in principle be discriminated using the relation between the star formation rate and galaxy stellar mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03793" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hot accretion onto spiral galaxies: the origin of extended and warped HI discs</a><span class="id">[2511.03793]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gas accretion, hot ($\sim 10^6\,{\rm K}$) atmospheres, and a tilt between the rotation axes of the disc and the atmosphere are all robust predictions of standard cosmology for massive star-forming galaxies at low redshift. Using idealized hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that the central regions of hot galaxy atmospheres continuously condense into cool ($\sim10^4\,{\rm K}$) discs, while being replenished by an inflow from larger scales. The size and orientation of the condensed disc are determined by the angular momentum of the atmosphere, so it is large and often tilted with respect to the pre-existing galaxy disc. Continuous smooth accretion from hot atmospheres can thus both provide the necessary fuel for star formation and explain the observed ubiquity of extended and warped HI discs around local spirals. In this hot accretion scenario, cool gas observations cannot be used to trace the source of the HI, warps out to halo radii, consistent with recent indications of a lack of $21\,{\rm cm}$ emission from the halos of nearby galaxies (the `HI desert'). Observations of HI warps formed via hot accretion can be used to constrain the angular momentum, accretion rate, and gas metallicity of hot galaxy atmospheres, important parameters for disc galaxy evolution that are hard to determine by other means.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Making the most of pure parallels: Machine learning augmented photometric redshifts for sparse JWST filter sets</a><span class="id">[2511.03802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) are an essential tool for galaxy evolution science with JWST. However, for deep surveys with more limited filter sets (i.e. $N_{\text{filt}} \sim6$) such as large pure parallel surveys, the most commonly used template-fitting based photo-$z$ approaches can yield highly confident but spurious results for high-$z$ populations of interest. The utility and legacy value of these datasets could therefore be negatively impacted. To address this challenge, we present an application of machine learning (ML) based photo-$z$ techniques to deep JWST photometric datasets. We employ two different ML algorithms, using Gaussian processes and nearest-neighbour estimates, alongside a more standard template fitting approach. We show that simple nearest-neighbour based estimates can provide more accurate photo-$z$s than template fitting out to $z\sim8$, as well as reducing the fraction of catastrophic outliers by a factor of $\sim2-3$. Additionally, `hybrid' estimates combining template and ML can yield further improvements in overall accuracy and reliability while retaining some ability to predict photo-$z$ out to $z &gt; 10$. The nearest-neighbour only or hybrid estimates can achieve photo-$z$s with robust scatter of $\sigma_{\text{NMAD}}\sim0.03-0.04$ and outlier fractions of $\sim3-10\%$ between $0 &lt; z \lesssim 8$ from just 6 NIRCam bands, with negligible additional computational costs compared to standard template fitting. Our methodology is easily adaptable to alternative datasets, filter combinations or training samples. Overall, our results highlight the potential for even simple ML techniques to enhance the scientific return of JWST pure parallel and wide-area surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar Evolution with Radiative Feedback in AGN Disks</a><span class="id">[2511.03904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars embedded in the inner pc region of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) experience extreme accretion conditions that significantly alter their evolution. We present one-dimensional MESA simulations of stars growing and decaying within AGN disks, implementing radiative-feedback-regulated accretion which limits stellar growth near the Eddington luminosity, as well as wind-driven mass loss. Unlike stand-alone stars in the field, these embedded stars follow unique evolutionary tracks with well-determined mass evolution and chemical yields. We distinguish two regimes: “immortal&quot; stars that indefinitely remain on the main sequence due to efficient hydrogen mixing; and “metamorphic&quot; stars that evolves off the main sequence, ultimately enriching the disk with heavy elements upon hydrogen and helium exhaustion in their cores. Results indicate that embedded stars in AGN disks can attain large masses, but gas retention and limited mixing likely render the “immortal&quot; track unsustainable. We show radiative feedback plays a critical role in preventing runaway growth, since it regulates the inflow to at most of order-unity the Eddington-limited mass-loss rate. Embedded metamorphic stars significantly enrich AGN disks with helium and $\alpha$-elements, potentially explaining the observed high metallicity in broad-line regions (BLR) without excessive helium enrichment. This study underscores the critical interplay between stellar feedback and accretion physics in shaping the stellar populations and chemical evolution within AGN disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin and Evolution of the $Ω$ Structure in the Head-Tail Radio Galaxy of Abell 3322</a><span class="id">[2511.03937]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A head-tail galaxy is thought to be a radio galaxy with bent active galactic nuclei (AGN) jets interacting with the intracluster medium (ICM). Study of head-tail galaxies provides us with fruitful insights into the mechanisms of shock waves and turbulence, as well as magnetic-field amplification and cosmic-ray acceleration. A recent MeerKAT observation revealed that a head-tail galaxy in the galaxy cluster, Abell 3322, exhibits a peculiar “Omega&quot; structure in its shape. In this paper, we investigated this Omega-tail galaxy using the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). We found that the southern jet tends to be brighter than the northern jet, with a brightness ratio of about 2. This can be attributed to Doppler boost and the inclination of the jets. Our broadband data suggest that the radio spectrum becomes steeper along the jet propagation direction, and the cosmic-ray aging model with a weak reacceleration of cosmic rays is preferable to explain the index profile. We further found a gradient of the spectral index perpendicular to the jet propagation. We discussed the origin of the gradient and suggested that a shock wave along one side of the jets is present. The resultant ram pressure as well as the backflow made at the early stage of the jet may produce the tail component of this Omega-tail galaxy, while the observed Omega-shape structure is more likely due to a twin vortex seen in the low Reynolds number flow.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOFIA FEEDBACK Survey: The Eagle Nebula in [C II] and Molecular Lines</a><span class="id">[2511.03978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We characterize the physical conditions and energy budget of the M16 H II region using SOFIA FEEDBACK observations of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line. The O stars in the $\sim 10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ NGC 6611 cluster powering this H II region have blown at least 2 cavities into the giant molecular cloud: the large M16 cavity and the small N19 bubble. We detect the spectroscopic signature of an expanding photodissociation region shell towards N19, and traces of a thin, fragmented expanding shell towards M16. Our [C II] observations are resolved to 0.5 km s$^{-1}$ and 15.5$^{\prime\prime}$ and analyzed alongside similarly resolved CO J=3$-$2 observations as well as archival data ranging from the radio to X-ray tracing a variety of gas phases spanning dense $\sim$10 K molecular gas, $10^{4}$ K photoionized gas, and million-K collisionally ionized plasma. With this dataset, we evaluate the coupling of energetic feedback from NGC 6611 and the O9 V star within N19 to the surrounding gas. Winds from NGC 6611 have blown a 20 pc radius cavity constrained in size along the major axis of the natal giant molecular filament, and much of the mechanical wind energy ($&gt;$90%) has escaped through breaches in the $\lesssim 10^{4}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ shell. Reservoirs of dense gas remain within a few parsecs of the cluster. N19, younger than M16 by $\gtrsim 10^6$ yr, is driven by a combination of mechanical wind energy and thermal pressure from photoionized gas and has swept up $\sim 10^{3}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ into neutral atomic and molecular shells.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-Diffuse, Ultra-Different: Observed vs. Simulated Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies Live in Fundamentally Different Halos</a><span class="id">[2511.04006]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we compare galaxies from the NIHAO and HESTIA simulation suites to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with spectroscopically measured dynamical masses. For each observed UDG, we identify the simulated dark matter halo that best matches its dynamical mass. In general, observed UDGs are matched to simulated galaxies with lower stellar masses than they are observed to have. These simulated galaxies also have halo masses much less than would be expected given the observed UDG's stellar mass and the stellar mass – halo mass relationship. We use the recently established relation between globular cluster (GC) number and halo mass, which has been shown to be applicable to UDGs, to better constrain their observed halo masses. This method indicates that observed UDGs reside in relatively massive dark matter halos. This creates a striking discrepancy: the simulated UDGs are matched to the dynamical masses of observed ones, but not their total halo masses. In other words, simulations can produce UDGs in halos with the correct inner dynamics, but not with the massive halos implied by GC counts. We explore several possible explanations for this tension, from both the observational and theoretical sides. We propose that the most likely resolution is that observed UDGs may have fundamentally different dark matter halo profiles than those produced in NIHAO and HESTIA. This highlights the need for a simulation that self-consistently produces galaxies of a stellar mass of $\sim 10^8 M_\odot$ in dark matter halos that exhibit the full range of large dark matter cores to cuspy NFW-like halos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine-Learning Estimation of Energy Fractions in MHD Turbulence Modes</a><span class="id">[2511.04119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation, heat conduction, and cosmic-ray scattering. MHD turbulence can be decomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfvén-each contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the limited information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find that the Alfvén and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions, multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We further introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional Residual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing anisotropies and compressibilities. Our model is trained on a suite of isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We further demonstrate that our machine learning model can robustly recover the mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 0.05 for seen data and 0.1 for unseen data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hadronic Processes in Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow as the Origin of TeV Excesses in BL Lac Objects</a><span class="id">[2511.04202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of certain BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) exhibit an additional hard $\gamma$-ray component in the TeV energy range that surpasses the predictions of the one-zone leptonic jet model. The origin of this excess emission remains unclear. In this study, we selected five BL Lacs whose SEDs display a very hard intrinsic spectrum in the TeV band and successfully reproduced their broadband SEDs using a two-zone lepto-hadronic model. Within this framework, the emission observed in the optical, X-ray, GeV $\gamma$-ray, and sub-TeV $\gamma$-ray bands is modeled using the synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton radiation processes of the relativistic electrons in the jets. Meanwhile, the TeV excess is attributed to $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from the photomeson ($p\gamma$) process via $\pi^0$ decay occurring within advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs). This scenario requires a hard proton spectrum with a spectral index of $p \sim 1.6-1.7$ and a cutoff energy ranging from 30 to 90 TeV, as well as a relatively large ADAF radius. Such hard proton spectra suggest that the dominant acceleration mechanisms are likely magnetic reconnection and/or stochastic acceleration processes within ADAFs. Additionally, the emission from the cascaded electrons results in a bump in the keV–MeV band; however, it is overwhelmed by the jet emission. Although the hadronuclear ($pp$) process cannot be entirely ruled out, it would necessitate an even harder proton spectrum and a higher cutoff energy compared to the $p\gamma$ process, making it a less favorable explanation for the observed TeV excess.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: IX: Spectroscopic detection of rare earth Dysprosium, Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium in Classical Cepheids</a><span class="id">[2511.04269]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Classical Cepheids are among the most important distance calibrators and play a crucial role in the calibration as the first rung of the extragalactic distance ladder. Given their typical age, they also constitute an optimal tracer of the young population in the Galactic disc. We aim to increase the number of available DCEPS with high-resolution spectroscopic metallicities, to study the galactocentric radial gradients of several chemical elements and analyse the spatial distribution of the Galactic young population of stars in the Milky Way disc. We performed a complete spectroscopical analysis of 136 spectra obtained from three different high-resolution spectrographs, for a total of 60 DCEPs. More than half have pulsational periods longer than 15 days, up to 70 days, doubling the number of stars in our sample with P&gt;15d. We derived radial velocities, atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances up to 33 different species. We present an updated list of trusted spectroscopic lines for the detection and estimation of chemical abundances. We used this new set to revisit the abundances already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey and increase the number of available chemical species. For the first time (to our knowledge), we present the estimation of abundances for Dysprosium, as well as a systematic estimation of Erbium, Lutetium and Thorium abundances. We calculate a galactic radial gradient for [Fe/H] with a slope of $-0.064\pm0.002$, in good agreement with recent literature estimation. The other elements also exhibit a clear negative radial trend, with this effect diminishing and eventually disappearing for heavier neutron-capture elements. Depending on the proposed spiral arms model present in several literature sources, our most external stars agree on tracing either the Perseus, the Norma-Outer or both the Outer and the association Outer-Scutum-Centaurus (OSC) arms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Apache Point Observatory extra-Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOeGEE): Chemical Abundance Trends for Seven Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies in the APOGEE Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.04365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In addition to comprehensive surveys of the Milky Way bulge, disk, and halo, the Apache Point Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) project observed seven dwarf spheroidal satellites (dSphs) of the Milky Way: Carina, Sextans, Sculptor, Draco, Ursa Minor, Bootes 1, and Fornax. APOGEE radial velocities, stellar parameters, and Gaia EDR3 proper motions are used to identify member stars in the vicinity of each dwarf. To properly analyze the abundance patterns of these galaxies, a novel procedure was developed to determine the measurable upper limits of the APOGEE chemical abundances as a function of the effective temperature and the spectral signal-to-noise ratio. In general, the APOGEE abundance patterns of these galaxies (limited to [Fe/H] $&gt;$ -2.5) agree with those found in high-resolution optical studies after abundance offsets are applied. Most of the galaxies studied have abundance patterns that are distinctly different from the majority of stars found in the MW halo, suggesting that these galaxies contributed little to the MW halo above [Fe/H] $&gt;$ -2.0. From these abundance patterns, we find that these dSphs tend to follow two types of chemical evolution paths: episodic and continuous star formation, a result that is consistent with previous photometric studies of their star formation histories. We explore whether mass and/or environment have an impact on whether a galaxy has an episodic or continuous star formation history, finding evidence that, in addition to the galaxy's mass, proximity to a larger galaxy and the cessation of star formation may drive the overall shape of the chemical evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project.

In this study, we present a suite of cosmological zoom-in simulations targeting high-redshift ($z \geq 10$) galaxies with dark matter halo masses in the range $10^{10} - 10^{11}\ {\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$, using state-of-the-art galaxy formation simulation codes (Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gadget-4, and Gizmo). This study aims to evaluate the convergence of the participating codes and their reproducibility of high-redshift galaxies with the galaxy formation model calibrated at relatively low redshift, without additional physics for high-redshift environments. The subgrid physics follows the AGORA CosmoRun framework, with adjustments to resolution and initial conditions to emulate similar physical environments in the early universe. The participating codes show consistent results for key galaxy properties (e.g., stellar mass), but also reveal notable differences (e.g., metallicity), indicating that galaxy properties at high redshifts are highly sensitive to the feedback implementation of the simulation. Massive halos (${\rm M}_{\rm halo}\geq5\times10^{10}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ at $z=10$) succeed in reproducing observed stellar masses, metallicities, and UV luminosities at $10\leq z\leq12$ without requiring additional subgrid physics, but tend to underpredict those properties at higher redshift. We also find that varying the dust-to-metal ratio modestly affects UV luminosity of simulated galaxies, whereas the absence of dust significantly enhances it. In future work, higher-resolution simulations will be conducted to better understand the formation and evolution of galaxies at Cosmic Dawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04504" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The ALMA-ATOMS-QUARKS survey: Resolving a chemically rich massive protostellar outflow</a><span class="id">[2511.04504]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive study on the physical and chemical structures of a chemically rich bipolar outflow in a high-mass star forming region IRAS 16272$-$4837 (SDC335), utilizing high-resolution spectral line data at 1.3 mm and 3 mm dual-bands from the ALMA ATOMS and QUARKS surveys. The high-velocity jet is enveloped by a lower-velocity outflow cavity, containing bright knots that show enhanced molecular intensities and elevated excitation temperatures. Along the outflow, we have identified 35 transitions from 22 molecular species. By analyzing the spatial distribution and kinematics of these molecular lines, we find that the molecular inventory in the outflow is regulated by three processes: (i) direct entrainment from the natal molecular core by the outflow; (ii) shock-induced release of molecules or atoms from dust grains; and (iii) thermal desorption and gas-phase reactions driven by shock heating. These results confirm that outflows are not only dynamical structures but also active chemical factories, where entrainment, shocks, and thermal processing jointly enrich the molecular content.

Therefore, probing the propagation effects of GWs by comparing the wave format detectors against the one at emission excepted from GR. Since such propagation effects accumulate through larger distance, it is expected that super-massive black holes binary (SMBHB) mergers serve as better targets than their stellarmass equivalent.

Since a dark matter halo is expected to exist in the Milky Way and around Sgr A$^*$, investigating the behavior of the Galactic Center black hole embedded in such a halo provides a crucial means to simultaneously probe both black hole physics and dark matter properties. In this work, We develop a black hole metric that incorporates a generalized double power law dark matter halo, and analyze the corresponding null and timelike geodesics to investigate how the halo parameters affect the black hole shadow and the motion of the S2 star. Furthermore, by comparing our theoretical predictions with observational data of the shadow and the S2 orbit, we constrained the dark matter halo parameters. The results of this study provide both theoretical and phenomenological insights into the nature of Sgr A$^*$ and the distribution of dark matter in our Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST PRIMER: A deep JWST study of all ALMA-detected galaxies in PRIMER COSMOS – dust-obscured star-formation history back to z $\simeq$ 7</a><span class="id">[2503.07774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging from the JWST PRIMER survey to study the properties of (sub)mm sources detected by ALMA in the centre of the COSMOS field, with the aim of better constraining the history of dust-enshrouded star formation. The wealth of ALMA data in this field enabled us to isolate a robust sample of 128 (sub)mm sources within the 175 sq. arcmin of the PRIMER COSMOS survey footprint, spanning two decades in (sub)mm flux density. The JWST imaging is deep/red enough to reveal secure galaxy counterparts for all of these sources. Moreover, 52% of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts, enabling us to refine the photo-zs for the remaining galaxies. Armed with this robust redshift information, we calculate the star-formation rates (SFR) and stellar masses of all 128 ALMA-detected galaxies, and place them in the context of other galaxies in the field. We find that the vast majority of star formation is dust-enshrouded in the ALMA-detected galaxies, with SFR ranging from  1000 down to  20 solar masses per year. We also find that virtually all (126/128) have high stellar masses, at all redshifts, with log(M/Msun) &gt; 10. The unusually high quality of our sample enables us to make a robust estimate of the contribution of the ALMA-detected galaxies to cosmic star-formation rate density from z = 2 out to z = 7. Finally, to correct for the fact that the deep ALMA pointings cover &lt; 20% of the PRIMER COSMOS area, we use our knowledge of all other massive galaxies in the field to produce a completeness-corrected estimate of dust-enshrouded star-formation rate density over cosmic time. This confirms that UV-visible star formation dominates at z &gt; 4, but also indicates that dust-enshrouded star formation likely still made a significant contribution at higher redshifts: extrapolation of our results suggest a  20% contribution at z = 8, and potentially still  5% at z = 10.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology with supernova Encore in the strong lensing cluster MACS J0138$-$2155: photometry, cluster members, and lens mass model</a><span class="id">[2503.09718]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The strongly lensed Supernova (SN) Encore at a redshift of $z = 1.949$, discovered behind the galaxy cluster MACS J0138$-$2155 at $z=0.336$, provides a rare opportunity for time-delay cosmography and studies of the SN host galaxy, where previously another SN, called SN Requiem, had appeared. To enable these studies, we combine new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) imaging, archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, and new Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic data to construct state-of-the-art lens mass models that are composed of cluster dark-matter (DM) halos and galaxies. We determine the photometric and structural parameters of the galaxies across six JWST and five HST filters. We use the color-magnitude and color-color relations of spectroscopically-confirmed cluster members to select additional cluster members, identifying a total of 84 galaxies belonging to the galaxy cluster. We construct seven different mass models using a variety of DM halo mass profiles, and explore both multi-plane and approximate single-plane lens models. As constraints, we use the observed positions of 23 multiple images from eight multiply lensed sources at four distinct spectroscopic redshifts. In addition, we use stellar velocity dispersion measurements to obtain priors on the galaxy mass distributions. We find that six of the seven models fit well to the observed image positions. Mass models with cored-isothermal DM profiles fit well to the observations, whereas the mass model with a Navarro-Frenk-White cluster DM profile has an image-position $\chi^2$ value that is four times higher. We build our ultimate model by combining four multi-lens-plane mass models and predict the image positions and magnifications of SN Encore and SN Requiem. Our work lays the foundation for building state-of-the-art mass models of the cluster for future cosmological analysis and SN host galaxy studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive JWST+ALMA Study on the Extended Ly$α$ Emitters, Himiko and CR7 at $z\sim 7$: Blue Major Merger Systems in Stark Contrast to Submillimeter Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2504.03156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present various properties of two bright extended Ly$\alpha$ objects, Himiko and CR7, at $z=6.6$ thoroughly investigated with JWST/NIRCam photometry, NIRSpec-IFU spectroscopy, and ALMA data, uncovering their physical origins.

The [CII]158$\mu$m and Ly$\alpha$ lines are found in the middle of two clumps (the brightest clump) in Himiko (CR7), suggesting that the distribution of neutral gas does not always coincide with that of ionized gas or stars in merging processes. We find that some of the clumps have broad [OIII] components (250–400$~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) in Himiko and CR7, likely tracing outflow and tidal features, while the central clump in Himiko presents a broad H$\alpha$ ($\sim1000~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}}$) line explained by an AGN with a low mass black hole of $M_\mathrm{BH}=10^{6.6}~M_\odot$, which contribute to the extended and bright nature of Himiko and CR7.

Remnants of partial TDEs are expected to be plentiful in our Galactic center, where at least six unexplained, diffuse, star-like &quot;G objects&quot; have already been detected which may have formed via interactions between stars and the SMBH. Using numerical simulations, this work aims to identify the characteristics of TDE remnants. We take 3D hydrodynamic FLASH models of partially disrupted stars and map them into the 1D stellar evolution code MESA to examine the properties of these remnants from tens to billions of years after the TDE. The remnants initially exhibit a brief, highly luminous phase, followed by an extended cooling period as they return to stable hydrogen burning. During the initial stage (&lt; 100,000 yr) their luminosities increase by orders of magnitude, making them intriguing candidates to explain a fraction of the mysterious G objects. Notably, mild TDEs are the most common and result in the brightest remnants during this initial phase. However, most remnants exist in a long-lived stage where they are only modestly offset in temperature and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of equivalent mass. Nonetheless, our results indicate remnants will sustain abnormal, metal-enriched envelopes that may be discernible through spectroscopic analysis. Identifying TDE survivors within the Milky Way could further illuminate some of the most gravitationally intense encounters in the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20043" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starlight from JWST: Implications for star formation and dark matter models</a><span class="id">[2504.20043]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We confront the star formation rate in different dark matter (DM) models with UV luminosity data from JWST up to $z\simeq25$ and legacy data from HST.

The DPM framework enables mock observations of the circumgalactic medium (CGM), group halos, and clusters across a number of wavebands including X-ray, sub-millimeter/millimeter, radio, and ultraviolet (UV). We introduce three model families calibrated to reproduce cluster profiles while having different extrapolations to the CGM – (i) self-similar halos, (ii) a reduced gas model for lower halo masses, and (iii) a model with shallower radial slopes at lower masses. We demonstrate how our z=0.0-0.6 models perform when applied to stacked and individual X-ray emission profiles, measurements of the thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Effect, electron dispersion measures from fast radio bursts, O VI absorption, and UV-derived pressures. Our investigation supports models that remove baryons from halos more effectively and have shallower profiles at lower halo mass. We discuss biases and systematics when modelling observables using consistent hot gaseous halo models for all wavebands explored.

While previous investigations have focused mainly on the intensity characteristics of optical cirrus, their morphological properties remain largely unexplored. In this study, we employ several complementary statistical approaches – local intensity statistics, angular power spectrum / $\Delta$-variance analysis, and Wavelet Scattering Transform analysis – to characterize the morphology of cirrus in deep optical imaging data. We place our investigation of optical cirrus into a multi-wavelength context by comparing the morphology of cirrus seen with the Dragonfly Telephoto Array to that seen with space-based facilities working at longer wavelengths (Herschel 250 $\mu m$, WISE 12$\mu m$, and Planck radiance), as well as with structures seen in the DHIGLS HI column density map. Our statistical methods quantify the similarities and the differences of cirrus morphology in all these datasets. The morphology of cirrus at visible wavelengths resembles that of far-infrared cirrus more closely than that of mid-infrared cirrus; on small scales, anisotropies in the cosmic infrared background and systematics may lead to differences. Across all dust tracers, cirrus morphology can be well described by a power spectrum with a common power-law index $\gamma\sim-2.9$. We demonstrate quantitatively that optical cirrus exhibits filamentary, coherent structures across a broad range of angular scales. Our results offer promising avenues for linking the analysis of coherent structures in optical cirrus to the underlying physical processes in the ISM that shape them. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these morphological signatures can be leveraged to distinguish and disentangle cirrus from extragalactic light.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Systematic Search for AGN Flares in ZTF Data Release 23</a><span class="id">[2507.20232]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are known to exhibit stochastic variability across a wide range of timescales and wavelengths.

We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MrMARTIAN: A Multi-resolution Mass Reconstruction Algorithm Combining Free-form and Analytic Components</a><span class="id">[2508.13262]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present ${\tt MrMARTIAN}$ (Multi-resolution MAximum-entropy Reconstruction Technique Integrating Analytic Node), a new hybrid strong lensing (SL) modeling algorithm.

Only one such galaxy currently exists in the literature with sufficient spatial magnification: The Sunburst Arc at redshift z = 2.37. Here, we present rest-frame optical JWST NIRSpec integral field observations of the Sunburst Arc that cover a large fraction of the source plane. From this dataset, we generate precise maps of ISM kinematics, dust geometry, ionization, and chemical enrichment. We extract a stacked spectrum of five gravitationally lensed images of the Lyman-Continuum leaking cluster, as well as an magnification-corrected, integrated spectrum of most of the galaxy, enabling a direct comparison to other LyC leakers in the literature. We find that the galaxy rotates but also shows strong, possibly dominant, signatures of turbulence, which are indicative of recent or ongoing major interaction. The cluster that leaks ionizing photons shows little variation in kinematics or dust coverage, but dramatically elevated ionization, indicating that photoionization is the predominant mechanism that creates paths for LyC escape. We conjecture that tidal stripping of H I gas due to an interaction could have removed a large portion of the neutral ISM around the LyC emitting cluster, making it easier for the cluster to completely ionize the rest.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13153" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dependency of the Bar Formation Timescale On The Halo Spin</a><span class="id">[2510.13153]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bars are among the most prominent structures in disk galaxies. While the widely accepted swing-amplification theory provides a qualitative framework for their formation, the detailed physical processes remain incompletely understood. Previous studies have shown that the bar formation timescale in isolated galaxies depends exponentially on the disk mass fraction (the so-called &quot;Fujii relation&quot;) and linearly on disk hotness and thickness. However, the influence of dark matter halo spin on bar formation has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we construct a suite of $N$-body models of disk and halo with varying disk mass fractions and amounts of random motions. By introducing prograde and retrograde spins in the dark matter halo, we explore how halo spin modifies the established empirical relations governing bar formation timescales. We find that these relations remain valid in both prograde and retrograde halo spin models. For rapid bar formation (short timescale), the effect of halo spin is nearly negligible. In contrast, for moderately slow bar formation, prograde (retrograde) halo spin tends to accelerate (suppress) bar onset. In cases of extremely slow bar formation, halo spin introduces a stronger but more stochastic influence. These trends might arise from the exchange of angular momentum between the stellar disk and the dark matter halo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18769" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pre-perihelion Development of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</a><span class="id">[2510.18769]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We describe pre-perihelion optical observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken during July - September 2025 using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (“index&quot;) n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of Carbon-rich AGB Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2511.00397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams (2CDs), and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02989" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1).

To complement this dataset, we investigate the average far-IR properties of Euclid-selected main sequence (MS) galaxies using existing Herschel and SCUBA-2 data. We use 17.6deg$^2$ (2.4deg$^2$) of overlapping Herschel (SCUBA-2) data, containing 2.6 million (240000) MS galaxies. We bin the Euclid catalogue by stellar mass and photometric redshift and perform a stacking analysis following SimStack, which takes into account galaxy clustering and bin-to-bin correlations. We detect stacked far-IR flux densities across a significant fraction of the bins. We fit modified blackbody spectral energy distributions in each bin and derive mean dust temperatures, dust masses, and star-formation rates (SFRs). We find similar mean SFRs compared to the Euclid catalogue, and we show that the average dust-to-stellar mass ratios decreased from z$\simeq$1 to the present day. Average dust temperatures are largely independent of stellar mass and are well-described by the function $T_2+(T_1-T_2){\rm e}^{-t/\tau}$, where $t$ is the age of the Universe, $T_1=79.7\pm7.4$K, $T_2=23.2\pm0.1$K, and $\tau=1.6\pm0.1$Gyr. We argue that since the dust temperatures are converging to a non-zero value below $z=1$, the dust is now primarily heated by the existing cooler and older stellar population, as opposed to hot young stars in star-forming regions at higher redshift. We show that since the dust temperatures are independent of stellar mass, the correlation between dust temperature and SFR depends on stellar mass. Lastly, we estimate the contribution of the Euclid catalogue to the cosmic IR background (CIB), finding that it accounts for &gt;60% of the CIB at 250, 350, and 500$\mu$m. Forthcoming Euclid data will extend these results to higher redshifts, lower stellar masses, and recover more of the CIB.</p></div></details></article>

Here, we present a deep neural network that can reconstruct the main neutrino properties of interest from the raw waveforms recorded by the radio antennas: the neutrino direction, the energy of the particle shower induced by the neutrino interaction, and the event topology, thereby estimating the neutrino flavor. For the first time, we predict the full posterior PDF for the energy and direction reconstruction via neural posterior estimation utilizing conditional normalizing flows, enabling event-by-event uncertainty prediction. We improve over previous reconstruction algorithms and obtain a median resolution of 0.30 log(E) and 18 square degrees for a 'shallow' detector component and 0.08 log(E) and 28 square degrees for a 'deep' detector component for neutral current (NC) events at a shower energy of 1 EeV. This deep learning approach also allows us to reconstruct the more stochastic $\nu_e$ - charged current (CC) events. We quantify the impact of different antenna types and systematic uncertainties on the reconstruction and derive a goodness-of-fit score to test the compatibility of measured neutrino signals with the Monte Carlo simulations used to train the neural network.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neural Network identification of Dark Star Candidates. II. Spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2511.04122]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Some of the first stars in the Universe might be powered by Dark Matter (DM) annihilations, rather than nuclear fusion. Those objects, i.e. Dark stars (DS), offer a unique window into understanding DM via the observational study of the formation and evolution of the first stars and their Black Hole (BH) remnants. In \cite{NNSMDSPhot} (Paper I) we introduced a feedforward neural network (FFNN) trained on synthetic DS photometry in order to detect and characterize dark star {\it photometric} candidates in the early universe based on data taken with the NIRCam instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). In this work we develop a FFNN trained on synthetic DS spectra in order to identify {\it spectroscopic} dark star candidates in the data taken with JWST's NIRSpec instrument. In order to validate our FFNN model we apply it to real data for the four spectroscopic Supermassive Dark Star (SMDS) candidates recently identified in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar} and reconfirm that indeed \JADESeleven, \JADESzthirteen, \JADESfz, and \JADESfo have spectra that are consistent with those of Supermassive Dark Stars. The main advantage of our FFNN model, in comparison to the Nedleaer-Mead Monte Carlo parameter estimator used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}, is that the approach introduced here predicts parameters in milliseconds, over 10,000 times faster than the traditional method used in \cite{ilie2025spectroscopicsupermassivedarkstar}. With this in mind, the FFNN model we developed and validated in this work will be adapted for Bayesian uncertainty analyses and automatic analyses of NIRSpec publicly available data for high redshift objects. This study establishes a robust and efficient tool for probing Dark Stars and understanding their role in cosmic evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04254" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3D Non-LTE radiation transfer: theory and applications to stars, exoplanets, and kilonovae</a><span class="id">[2511.04254]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Most of the physical information about astrophysical objects is obtained via the analysis of their electromagnetic spectra. Observed data coupled with radiation transfer models in physical conditions representative of stars, planets, kilonovae, and ISM, yield constrains on their physical structure, gas flow dynamics at the surface, mass loss, and detailed chemical composition of the systems. All these core astrophysical parameters are just as reliable as the physical quality of the models that are employed for simulations of radiation transfer. Recent advances in multi-D transfer modeling with Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) in inhomogeneous time-dependent systems revealed systematic shortcomings of canonical models. Owing to major complexities of solving coupled multi-frequency RT equations in 3D geometry, a number of approximations have been introduced. This review presents an overview of the physical problem, standard solutions, and recent methodological advances. We also provide an overview of main results in the area of 3D NLTE radiation transfer and its applications to modeling diverse astrophysical environments, including FGKM type- and OBA-type stars, multi-epoch spectra of kilonovae, and atmospheres of rocky and gaseous exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artificial Precision Polarization Array: Sensitivity for the axion-like dark matter with clock satellites</a><span class="id">[2511.04400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The approaches to searching for axion-like signals based on pulsars include observations with pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) and pulsar polarization arrays (PPAs). However, these methods are limited by observational uncertainties arising from multiple unknown and periodic physical effects, which substantially complicate subsequent data analysis. To mitigate these issues and improve data fidelity, we propose the Artificial Pulsar Polarization Arrays (APPA): a satellite network comprising multiple pulsed signal transmitters and a dedicated receiver satellite. In order to constrain the axion-photon coupling parameter $g_{a\gamma}$, we generate simulated observations using Monte Carlo methods to investigate APPA's sensitivity via two complementary approaches: Bayesian analysis and frequentist analysis. Simulations indicate that for axion mass $m_{a}\sim\mathcal{O}\big(10^{-22}-10^{-19}\big)$ eV, APPA yields a better upper limit on $g_{a\gamma}$ (at the 95\% confidence level) than conventional ground-based observations and achieves better detection sensitivity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04429" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cutana: A High-Performance Tool for Astronomical Image Cutout Generation at Petabyte Scale</a><span class="id">[2511.04429]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Euclid Quick Data Release 1 (Q1) encompasses 30 million sources across 63.1 square degrees, marking the beginning of petabyte-scale data delivery through Data Release 1 (DR1) and subsequent releases.

We introduce Cutana, a memory-efficient software tool optimised for batch processing in both local and cloud-native environments. Cutana employs vectorised NumPy operations to extract cutout batches simultaneously from FITS tiles, implements automated memory-aware scheduling, and supports both Zarr and FITS output formats with multiple common normalisation schemes (asinh, log, zscale). Cutana outperforms Astropy in all tested Q1 subset scenarios achieving near linear scaling and processing thousands of cutouts per second. On just four worker threads, Cutana can process all of Q1 in under four hours. The tool includes an ipywidget interface for parameter configuration and real-time monitoring.

We apply this resource to conduct a systematic analysis across a grid of eight cosmological models, including $\Lambda$CDM and seven extensions, and 39 datasets, including individual probes and their pairwise combinations. Our model comparison reveals that whilst individual datasets show varied preferences for model extensions, the base $\Lambda$CDM model is most frequently preferred in combined analyses, with the general trend suggesting that evidence for new physics is diluted when probes are combined. Using five complementary statistics, we quantify tensions, finding the most significant to be between DES and Planck (3.57$\sigma$) and SH0ES and Planck (3.27$\sigma$) within $\Lambda$CDM. We characterise the $S_8$ tension as high-dimensional ($d_G=6.62$) and resolvable in extended models, whereas the Hubble tension is low-dimensional and persists across the model space. Caution should be exercised when combining datasets in tension. The $\texttt{unimpeded}$ data products, hosted on Zenodo, provide a powerful resource for reproducible cosmological analysis and underscore the robustness of the $\Lambda$CDM model against the current compendium of data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Exoplanet Yield of Gaia Astrometry</a><span class="id">[2511.04673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We re-examine the expected yield of Gaia astrometric planet detections using updated models for giant-planet occurrence, the local stellar population, and Gaia's demonstrated astrometric precision.

Unlike GW signals, non-stationary noise can appear in both the GW-signal quadrature and the orthogonal quadrature, which is usually not measured. Simultaneous sensing of this orthogonal quadrature provides a witness channel that can be used to reconstruct the disturbance in the signal quadrature enabling a subtraction of non-stationary noise. Here, we present the concept of quadrature witness that is compatible with frequency-dependent squeezing, which is already used to simultaneously reduce photon shot noise and photon radiation pressure noise. We demonstrate that implementing this approach in a GW detector could reduce noise caused by loud back-scatter events, thereby improving the overall sensitivity and robustness of GW observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse for Gravitational-Wave Analyses</a><span class="id">[2511.04218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce Accelerated Sequential Posterior Inference via Reuse (ASPIRE), a broadly applicable framework that transforms existing posterior samples and Bayesian evidence estimates into unbiased results under alternative models without rerunning the original analysis.

This addresses a growing problem in gravitational-wave astronomy, where events must be repeatedly reanalyzed under different models or physical hypotheses.

This research advances space thermal modeling by improving the simulation accuracy and efficiency of radiative heat transfer, the dominant mode of heat exchange in space. To this end, we incorporate diffuse reflectivity using the Gebhart method, which computes radiative exchange factors (REFs) from geometric view factors. The view factors, obtained via Monte Carlo ray tracing (MCRT), require post-processing to mitigate statistical errors. Critically, existing correction schemes cannot simultaneously enforce closure and reciprocity for open systems. This research addresses this gap by proposing two novel enforcement methods: (i) a least-squares optimization with non-negativity rectification (NNR) and small positive value avoidance (SPVA), and (ii) an iterative enforcement algorithm. To ensure consistency across different discretization levels, this work also introduces the multi-node surface model relations to formalize the connection between sub-face, face, and node representations of view factors and REFs. A simple case study demonstrates a substantial reduction in mean absolute error (MAE): the least-squares method achieves an 81% MAE reduction, while the iterative method offers the best balance of accuracy (56% MAE reduction) and computational efficiency. A second case study shows that including diffuse reflections decreases the steady-state temperature of a plate by $4^{\circ}C$, reinforcing that reflected radiation reduces net absorption. This work introduces and validates computationally efficient methods for integrating diffuse reflectivity into space thermal analyses and for consistently coupling multi-node surface radiative models. The results enable more accurate and robust thermal predictions for spacecraft systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mitigating effects of nonlinearities in homodyne quadrature interferometers</a><span class="id">[2511.04386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Homodyne Quadrature interferometers (HoQI) are an interferometric displacement sensing scheme proven to have excellent noise performance, making them a strong candidate for sensing and control schemes in gravitational wave detector seismic isolation. Like many interferometric schemes, HoQIs are prone to nonlinear effects when measuring displacements. These nonlinearities, if left unsuppressed, would substantially limit the use cases of HoQIs. This paper first shows a means of measuring and quantifying nonlinearities using a working HoQI and a mechanical resonator. We then demonstrate a method for real-time correction of these nonlinearities and several approaches for accurately calibrating the correction technique. By correcting in real time, we remove one of the biggest obstacles to including HoQIs in upgrades to future gravitational wave detectors. Finally, we discuss how to post correct data from HoQIs, suppressing even further the nonlinearity-induced errors, broadening the appeal of such sensors to other applications where measurement data can be reconstructed after the fact. We demonstrate all of this on a working HoQI system and show the measured suppression of nonlinear effects from each of these methods. Our work makes HoQIs a more broadly applicable tool for displacement sensing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demonstrating Agreement between Radio and Fluorescence Measurements of the Depth of Maximum of Extensive Air Showers at the Pierre Auger Observatory</a><span class="id">[2310.19963]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show, for the first time, radio measurements of the depth of shower maximum ($X_\text{max}$) of air showers induced by cosmic rays that are compared to measurements of the established fluorescence method at the same location.

Timing analyses reveal type-B and type-C Quasi-periodic Oscillations across different spectral states, often associated with episodic radio ejections. Broadband ($0.7-60$ keV) spectral modeling, employing disc, Comptonization, and reflection components, reveals degeneracies in constraining disc-corona geometries. Polarimetric measurements in $2-8$ keV band detect significant polarization degrees (PDs) ranging from $3-20.6\%$ ($1.2-21.4\%$) in harder (softer) states, with moderate to strong energy dependence, except for LMC X$-1$, Swift J$151857.0-572147$, and MAXI J1744$-$294, where no significant polarization is detected.

However, all galaxy catalogs are incomplete, i.e. they only include a subset of all galaxies, typically being biased towards the bright end of the luminosity distribution. This sub-selection systematically affects the dark siren inference of the Hubble constant $H_0$, so a completeness relation has to be introduced that accounts for the missing objects. In the literature it is standard to assume that the missing galaxies are uniformly distributed across the sky and that the galaxy magnitude distribution is known. In this work we develop a novel method which improves upon these assumptions and reconstructs the underlying true galaxy field, respecting the spatial correlation of galaxies on large scales. In our method the true magnitude distribution of galaxies is inferred alongside the spatial galaxy distribution. Our method results in an improved three-dimensional prior in redshift and sky position for the host galaxy of a GW event, which is expected to make the resulting $H_0$ posterior more robust. Building on our previous work, we make a number of improvements, and validate our method on simulated data based on the Millennium simulation.

Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey – a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data – NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16139" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Order-by-order Modeling of Exoplanet Radial Velocity Data</a><span class="id">[2510.16139]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precise radial velocity (RV) measurements are a crucial tool for exoplanet discovery and characterization.
