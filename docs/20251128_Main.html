Yet, their understanding remains incomplete. Recent global Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations have raised several questions that led us to question their validity and their extrapolation to realistic particle Lorentz factors, electric and magnetic fields. We want to generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation from first principles. We propose a novel method to study the Equatorial Current Sheet (ECS) where most of the particle acceleration and the high-energy radiation is expected to originate. We first determine its shape and external magnetic field with a steady-state ideal force-free solution. Then, we consider the extra electric and magnetic field components that develop when dissipation is considered. Finally, we study the particle acceleration and radiation that is due to these extra field components for realistic field and particle parameters. We generate realistic sky maps of high-energy radiation and compare them with those obtained via PIC simulations. These sky maps may also be closely reproduced using the ECS of the split-monopole solution beyond the light cylinder. The ECS is probably stabilized by the normal magnetic field component that is due to the global magnetospheric reconnection. Our method helps us better understand the origin of the pulsed high-energy radiation in the pulsar magnetosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game Theory in Cosmology</a><span class="id">[2511.20739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a game-theoretic statistical framework for cosmology, which we term \textit{Cosmological Teleodynamics}. We recast the dark sector, cosmic acceleration, large-scale structure, and cosmic tensions as emergent consequences of nonlocal memory and intrinsically persistent organization in a self-gravitating Universe. By introducing a maximum-caliber weight on cosmic histories and a bias functional encoding structural memory, we derive modified Friedmann, Boltzmann, and Poisson equations that naturally generate dark energy-like acceleration, dark matter-like clustering, and scale-dependent growth suppression. We also show how this approach can naturally help alleviate the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions, can produce anisotropic velocity fields, and predict environment-dependent halo signatures that cannot arise from particle dark matter or scalar-field dark energy. We also derive a generalized horizon entropy and temperature, revealing a nonequilibrium statistical origin for cosmic acceleration and formulating a Law of Universal Arbitrage Equilibrium that governs the evolution of the Universe, showing that it is expanding towards a continuous form of Nash equilibrium. Cosmological Teleodynamics therefore offers a unified, emergent, and testable alternative to the conventional dark sector, rooted not in new particles but in the intrinsic statistical and systemic structure of cosmic memory, and shows that the universe itself operates like a giant potential game.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20756" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Order Photon Rings around Kerr Naked Singularities</a><span class="id">[2511.20756]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed study of higher-order photon rings of an accreting Kerr naked singularity (KNS) with dimensionless spin parameter $a=1.01$; i.e., a horizonless, overly spinning compact object. Motivated by horizon-scale very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI) including Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and future missions such as the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), we analyze image morphology and interferometric visibilities to identify observational signatures that differentiate KNS from Kerr black holes. We find that higher-order photon rings are tightly concentrated within the nominal “shadow” region and that the shadow develops a pronounced gap at sufficiently large observer inclination. These morphological differences produce measurable deviations in the complex visibilities relative to Kerr black hole predictions. Our results indicate that photon-ring structure and visibility-domain diagnostics at horizon-resolving baselines can provide a direct observational test of the presence (or absence) of an event horizon and thus offer a concrete avenue to test general relativity with future horizon-scale observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effect of the Fast-Flavor Instability on Core-Collapse Supernova Models: II. Quasi-Equipartition and the Impact of Various Angular Reconstruction Methods</a><span class="id">[2511.20767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we explore in a consistent fashion the effects of fast flavor conversion (FFC) in 1D and 2D core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations. In addition, we investigate the impact of various angular reconstruction methods and compare the “3-species” and “4-species” neutrino transport schemes. We find that the FFC effects are insensitive to the different methods tested and that the FFC alters supernova hydrodynamics is only minor ways. We also present a “quasi-equipartition” approximation which can be used to estimate the FFC-altered neutrino properties by post-processing the neutrino signals extracted from no-oscillation CCSN simulations. The relative errors in neutrino number and energy luminosities of this phenomenological method are less than 2\% for 1D models, and less than 10\% for 2D models. This method provides a simple way to include the effects of FFC on neutrino signals without implementing a complex and expensive FFC scheme or redoing simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An empirical view of the extended atmosphere and inner envelope of the asymptotic giant branch star R Doradus. II. Constraining the dust properties with radiative transfer modelling</a><span class="id">[2511.20816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Mass loss in oxygen-rich asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars remains poorly understood, as the dust detected around them appears too transparent to drive winds through absorption alone. The current paradigm invokes outflows driven by photon scattering on relatively large grains ($\sim0.3\,\mu$m), but whether such grains exist in sufficient quantities remains uncertain. We test whether the dust around the oxygen-rich AGB star R Doradus can drive its wind by combining polarimetric constraints, elemental abundance limits, and force-balance calculations. We examine Fe-free silicates (MgSiO$_3$), alumina (Al$_2$O$_3$), and Fe-bearing silicates (MgFeSiO$_4$) to evaluate whether any species can produce enough radiative pressure under realistic conditions. Using high-angular-resolution polarimetric observations from SPHERE/ZIMPOL at the VLT, we model the circumstellar dust with RADMC-3D and explore a broad parameter space in grain size, density structure, and wavelength-dependent stellar radius. For models consistent with the observations, we assess wind feasibility using updated gas-density profiles, elemental depletion constraints, and radiation-pressure thresholds. Although several dust configurations reproduce the observed scattering patterns, none generate sufficient radiative force at realistic gas-to-dust ratios, even under maximal elemental depletion. Our results for R Doradus indicate that photon scattering on dust cannot by itself launch the wind, implying that additional mechanisms must contribute.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring Dust Masses of Protoplanetary Disks in Serpens and L1641/L1647 with ALMA</a><span class="id">[2511.20817]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protoplanetary disks are an essential component of the planet-formation process. The amount of dust and gas in the disk constrains the number and size of planets that can form in a system. We analyze 178 T-Tauri stars, 18 in Serpens and 160 in L1641/L1647, and measure their disk dust masses using spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling and multiwavelength data, including 1.3 mm (ALMA band 6) fluxes from the literature. The disk masses calculated in this work are up to $\sim$2 times higher than those previously reported. We conclude that this is because disks may be partially optically thick at millimeter wavelengths while most calculations of the disk mass assume that the disk is optically thin at 1.3 mm. We calculate optical depths at 1.3 and 7 mm for a subset of the Serpens and L1641/L1647 disk sample and show that the vast majority of disks become optically thin at longer millimeter wavelengths; thus, observations at 7 mm (i.e., ALMA band 1) are vital to better characterize disk dust masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is there a retrograde accretion disk around 4U 1626$-$67? Tracking torque reversals with a state-space model</a><span class="id">[2511.20847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>X-ray timing studies of the persistent, Galactic, accretion-powered pulsar 4U 1626$-$67 reveal torque reversals, during which the pulse frequency $\nu(t)$ alternates between multiyear episodes of secular acceleration and deceleration, separated by transitions lasting $\lesssim 150 \, \rm{days}$. Here an unscented Kalman filter is applied to track the $\nu(t)$ fluctuations observed in 22.7 years (3340 samples) of publicly available Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory and Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope data to test the canonical picture of magnetocentrifugal accretion for consistency with prograde-prograde and retrograde-prograde accretion disk configurations on either side of the 2008 torque reversal. It is found that the retrograde-prograde model is preferred, with a log Bayes factor equal to 0.44 and maximum a posteriori log likelihood ratio equal to 2.5. The mass accretion rate $Q(t)$ and magnetocentrifugal fastness $\omega(t)$ transition smoothly between episodes of deceleration and acceleration; $Q(t)$ shifts by $\leq 0.34 \, {\rm dex}$ across the reversal, and one measures $\omega(t) \approx 0.25$ and $\omega(t) \approx 0.30$ during deceleration and acceleration, respectively. The angular acceleration $\dot{\Omega}(t)$ satisfies $-9 \lesssim \dot{\Omega}(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim -5$ and $2 \lesssim \dot{\Omega}(t)/(10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}) \lesssim 9$ before and after the 2008 reversal, respectively, compared to $\dot{\Omega} \approx -3.0 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ before reversal and $\dot{\Omega} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-12} \, \rm{rad \, s^{-2}}$ after reversal, as inferred from previous long-term X-ray timing and spectral analysis of 4U 1626$-$67.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation. Controlling angular systematics in the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy sample</a><span class="id">[2511.20856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the strategy to identify and mitigate potential sources of angular systematics in the Euclid spectroscopic galaxy survey, and we quantify their impact on galaxy clustering measurements and cosmological parameter estimation. We first survey the Euclid processing pipeline to identify all evident, potential sources of systematics, and classify them into two broad classes: angular systematics, which modulate the galaxy number density across the sky, and catastrophic redshift errors, which lead to interlopers in the galaxy sample. We then use simulated spectroscopic surveys to test our ability to mitigate angular systematics by constructing a random catalogue that represents the visibility mask of the survey; this is a dense set of intrinsically unclustered objects, subject to the same selection effects as the data catalogue. The construction of this random catalogue relies on a detection model, which gives the probability of reliably measuring the galaxy redshift as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of its emission lines. We demonstrate that, in the ideal case of a perfect knowledge of the visibility mask, the galaxy power spectrum in the presence of systematics is recovered, to within sub-percent accuracy, by convolving a theory power spectrum with a window function obtained from the random catalogue itself. In the case of only approximate knowledge of the visibility mask, we test the stability of power spectrum measurements and cosmological parameter posteriors by using perturbed versions of the random catalogue. We find that significant effects are limited to very large scales, and parameter estimation remains robust, with the most impacting effects being connected to the calibration of the detection model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20908" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automated all-sky detection of γ Doradus / δ Scuti hybrids in TESS data from positive unlabelled (PU) learning</a><span class="id">[2511.20908]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has observed hundreds of millions of stars, substantially contributing to the available pool of high-precision photometric space data. Among them are the relatively rare $\gamma$ Doradus / $\delta$ Scuti ($\gamma$ Dor / $\delta$ Sct) hybrid pulsators, which have been previously studied using Kepler data. These stars are perfect laboratories to probe both inner and outer interior stellar layers thanks to them exhibiting both pressure and gravity modes. We seek to classify an all-sky sample of AF stars observed by TESS to find previously undiscovered hybrid pulsators and supply them in a catalogue of candidates. We also aim to compare the light curves produced with the TESS-Gaia Light Curve (TGLC) pipeline, currently underused in variability studies, with other publicly available light curves. We compared dominant and secondary frequencies of confirmed hybrid pulsators in Kepler, extended mission Quick Look Pipeline (QLP) data, and nominal and extended mission TGLC data. We then used a feature-based positive unlabelled (PU) learning classifier to search for new hybrid pulsators amongst TESS AF stars and investigated the properties of the detected populations. We find that the variability of confirmed hybrids in TGLC agrees well with the one occurring in QLP light curves and has a high recovery rate of \kepler-extracted frequencies. Our `smart binning' method allows for robust extraction of hybrids from large unlabelled datasets, with an average out-of-bag prediction for test set hybrids at 93.04\%. The analysis of dominant frequencies in high-probability candidates shows that we find more pressure-mode dominant hybrids. Our catalogue includes 62,026 new candidate light curves from the nominal and extended TESS missions, with individual probabilities of being a hybrid in each available sector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Diversity of Cold Worlds: Age and Characterization of the Exoplanet COCONUTS-2b</a><span class="id">[2511.20923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Studying cold brown dwarfs is key to understanding the diverse characteristics of cold giant exoplanets atmospheres. COCONUTS-2, is a wide binary system composed of a T9 brown dwarf and an M3 star, which presents a unique opportunity to characterize a cold benchmark brown dwarf. As part of a JWST program to study the range of physical and atmospheric properties of the coldest brown dwarfs, we obtained NIRSpec G395H spectra (R 2700, 2.87-5.13 um) and MIRI F1000W, F1280W, and F1800W photometry for COCONUTS-2b. In this work, we find a 99% probability of the system belonging to the Corona of Ursa Major (414+/-23 Myr) using BANYAN Sigma and its full kinematics. We also re-estimate the astrometry of COCONUTS-2b using the MIRI data. We support the membership with a comparison of rotation period, metallicity and C/O ratio of the group with those of the COCONUTS-2 system. We also calculate its bolometric luminosity, which combined with our age estimation, allows us to derive its mass, effective temperature, surface gravity, and radius with high precision. As a result of our analysis, we support the conclusion that COCONUTS-2b is a planetary mass object (7.5+/-0.4 MJup) which was likely formed via the same mechanism as stars. In addition we compare the JWST spectrum to another object in the sample, J082507.35+280548.5 (0825+2805), a Y0.5 brown dwarf, which is a candidate member of the same moving group, but has a lower mass (3.7+/-0.2 MJup). We identify absorption feature differences which could indicate that 0825+2805 has stronger vertical mixing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-order Gravity-mode Period Spacing Patterns of Intermediate-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot &lt; M &lt; 3 \, M_{\odot}$) Main-sequence Stars I. Perturbative Analysis</a><span class="id">[2511.20948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Theoretical study of high-order gravity-mode period spacing ($\Delta P_g$) pattern is relevant for the better understanding of internal properties of intermediate-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot &lt; M &lt; 8 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence g-mode pulsators. In this paper, we carry out the first-order perturbative analysis to evaluate effects of a sharp, though not discontinuous, transition in the Brunt-Väisälä (BV) frequency on the $\Delta P_g$ pattern. Such a finite-width transition in the BV frequency, whose scale height can be comparable to the local wavelength of gravity waves, is expected to develop in relatively low-mass ($1.5 \, M_\odot &lt; M &lt; 3 \, M_{\odot}$) main-sequence stars, causing a bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency. Inspired by Unno et al.'s formulation, we treat the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency as a small perturbation, which allows us to derive an analytical expression of the $\Delta P_g$ pattern. The analytical expression shows that the amplitude of the oscillatory $\Delta P_g$ pattern is determined by a weighted average of the bump in the second derivative of the BV frequency where the weighting function is given by the g-mode eigenfunction. Tests with low-mass ($\sim 2 \, M_\odot$) main-sequence stellar models show that the analytical expression can reproduce the $\Delta P_g$ patterns numerically computed reasonably well. The results of our perturbative analysis will be useful for, e.g., improving semi-analytical expressions of the $\Delta P_g$ pattern, which would enable us to investigate $\Delta P_g$ patterns of SPB stars and $\gamma$ Dor stars for inferring chemical composition profile and rotation rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The diverse morphology of gravitational wave signals from merging neutron-star white-dwarf binaries</a><span class="id">[2511.20970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In sufficiently compact neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) binary systems, orbital decay means the white dwarf eventually fills its shrinking Roche lobe, initiating a phase of mass transfer. The exchange of angular momentum-both internal and external-plays a critical role in determining the binary's evolutionary outcome. For neutron stars with relatively low magnetic fields and spin frequencies, whether the orbital separation continues to shrink depends on the interplay between gravitational wave (GW) radiation and mass transfer dynamics. We compute the orbital evolution of NSWD binaries across a broad parameter space, incorporating four key variables. Our results reveal distinct boundaries in the NS-WD mass-mass diagram: binaries with white dwarf masses above these thresholds undergo rapid orbital decay and direct coalescence. The dependence of these boundaries on system parameters indicates that Roche-lobe-filling NSWD binaries can follow multiple evolutionary pathways – a phenomenon we refer to as branched or polymorphic evolution. NSWD binary systems emit strong and diverse GW signals, many of which would be detectable by space-based GW observatories. The morphology of the evolving GW waveform provides a direct diagnostic for the NSWD binary configuration, including any contribution from an accretion disk. Our models can provide critical waveform templates for identifying merging binary signals in real-time GW data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21062" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiwavelength Observations for a Double-decker Filament Channel in AR 13102</a><span class="id">[2511.21062]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the observational evidence of the existence of a double-decker filament channel (FC) by using observations in extreme ultraviolet and H{\alpha} wavelengths. For both FCs, the east foot-point roots in the active region (AR), while the west one roots in the remote quiet region. The bottom FC (FC1) appears as intermittent filaments. Within the AR, the FC1 appears as an S-shaped filament (F1), which consisted of two J-shaped filaments (F1S/F1N for the south/north one). For the upper one (FC2), only the east part is filled with dark plasma and visible as a small filament (F2). Its east foot-point roots around the junction of F1S and F1N. Initially, due to the recurrent reconnections, F1N and F1S link to each other and form a new filament (F3) thread by thread. Meanwhile, the heated plasma, which appears as brightening features, flows from the east foot-point of F2 to the west, and becomes invisible about 1.1$\times$10^{5} km away. The failed eruption of F1S is triggered by the reconnection, which appears as the brightening threads changing their configuration from crossed to quasiparallel in between the F1S and F3, and is confined by the upper magnetic field. Associated with the eruption, the distant invisible plasma becomes visible as a brightening feature. It continuously flows to the remote foot-point, and becomes invisible before reaching it. The brightening plasma flow outlines the skeleton of FC2 gradually. The observations show the existence of a double-decker FC, as a magnetic structure, before they appear as a brightening/dark feature when fully filled with hot/cool plasma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing Bump in the Cosmological Power Spectrum Using Dwarf Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.21134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the possibility of using observational data on nearby dwarf galaxies – their luminosity functions and spatial distributions – to constrain deviations of the cosmological power spectrum from the standard one.

Such a spectrum is motivated by observations of an excess number of galaxies at high redshifts.

Comparison with observations constrains the bump amplitude to $\mathcal{A} &lt; 0.25$ at a 3-sigma significance level for a wavelength of 1.3 Mpc.

Using one-dimensional kinetic simulations, we investigate how mono-energetic and power-law CR momentum distributions influence the growth and saturation of NRSI. The linear growth is governed solely by the CR current and is largely insensitive to the CR distribution. However, the saturation depends strongly on the CR distribution and is achieved through CR isotropization, which quenches the driving current. Mono-energetic CRs effectively amplify the magnetic field and isotropize. For power-law distributions, the lowest-energy CRs dominate current relaxation and magnetic growth, while the highest-energy CRs remain weakly scattered, limiting their contribution to saturation. In the absence of low-energy CRs, high-energy particles amplify magnetic fields effectively and isotropize. We provide a modified saturation prescription accounting for these effects and propose a layered CR-confinement scenario upstream of astrophysical shocks, relevant to particle acceleration to high energies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on Features in the Cosmological Power Spectrum from Observations of the Epoch of Reionization</a><span class="id">[2511.21179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider cosmological models with a power spectrum of perturbations featuring an enhanced amplitude on dwarf galaxy scales (with a &quot;bump&quot; or a &quot;tilt&quot;).

Based on the availability of simultaneous multi-wavelength data and considering flux level as the depiction of AGN-jet activity we identified 11 epochs (named as Epoch-A to Epoch-K) and investigated temporal as well as spectral variability during these epochs to understand the emission properties in this source. The fractional variability analysis reveals that, in all epochs, X-ray light curve exhibits relatively high degree of variability in compared to the optical, UV and gamma-ray light curves. The flux-flux plots among different bands, in general, show weak to moderate correlation with Spearman correlation coefficient ranging from 0.29 to 0.58. Notably, during Epoch-I, we detect a possible orphan flare exhibiting increase in the X-ray flux level ($\sim$ 2.4 times of the total average flux) but with no corresponding counterpart seen in the optical, UV bands. In contrast, during Epoch-K, we detect a significant decrease in the X-ray flux but no corresponding decrease in optical, UV and gamma-ray bands. Overall, our study reveals several changes in the flux states and complex nature of jet dominated emission processes.

Under different disk conditions, we compared the dynamical evolution of planets with different planet-to-star mass ratios. We find that accretion of planets can significantly diminish the inward migration tendency of planets, or even change the migration direction. The migration of low-/high-mass planets is classified as Type I/II inward migration, respectively, while intermediate-mass planets, which have the strongest accretion, show an outward migration trend. We confirm that the outward migration is mainly attributed to the positive torque from the azimuthal asymmetric structures around the accreting planet, similar to Li et al. (2024). The termination of planetary mass growth is thus synonymous with the transition from outward to inward migration. For the high viscosity $\alpha=0.04$ and disk aspect ratio height $h_0=0.05$ cases, the mass ratio range for planetary outward migration is $1\times10^{-4}\lesssim q\lesssim4\times10^{-3}$. For the low viscosity case with $\alpha=0.001$, and/or the low disk aspect ratio cases $h_0=0.03$, the mass ratio range for the outward migration will shift toward the lower end. Our parameter survey reveals that a simple gap opening parameter determines the outward migration condition; details of the analytical interpretation are presented in Ida et al. (2025).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Planet Migration in Protoplanetary Disks with Rims</a><span class="id">[2511.21328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Complex structures, including sharp edges, rings and gaps, have been commonly observed in protoplanetary disks with or without planetary candidates. Here we consider the possibility that they are the intrinsic consequences of angular momentum transfer mechanisms, and investigate how they may influence the dynamical evolution of embedded planets. With the aid of numerical hydrodynamic simulations, we show that gas giants have a tendency to migrate away from sharp edges, whereas super-Earths embedded in the annuli tend to be retained. This implies that, observationally, Jupiters are preferentially detected in dark rings (gaps), whereas super-Earths tend to be found in bright rings (density bumps). Moreover, planets' tidal torque provide, not necessarily predominant, feedback on the surface density profile. This tendency implies that Jupiter's gap-opening process deepens and widens the density gap associated with the dark ring, while super-Earths can be halted by steep surface density gradient near the disk or ring boundaries. 13Hence, we expect there would be a desert for super-Earths in the surface density gap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonance locking and tidal evolution in rotating γ-Doradus binaries</a><span class="id">[2511.21347]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In binary systems, studying tidal interactions is key to understanding the evolution of binary populations. The primary dissipation process occurring in stars with radiative envelopes is believed to be radiative damping of high-radial-order tidally excited oscillations, which is in agreement with observations of most binary systems. However, recent studies have suggested that outside this dissipation regime, dynamical tides can act in the opposite manner (a phenomenon known as inverse tides), and resonance locking could significantly impact the orbital evolution of binary systems. We aim to study inverse tides and resonance locking by simultaneously including the effect of all the forcing frequencies and accounting for the effect of the rotation on the forced oscillations. We have developed an orbital evolution code that is coupled to a stellar oscillation code to compute on the fly the impact of dynamical tides on the rotational and orbital evolution of binary systems including multiple simultaneous forcing frequencies. We find that resonance locking can be stable over a long period of time and a source of long-term exchange of angular momentum for rapidly rotating stars. Long-term locking can increase the total angular momentum of a fast-rotating star by approximately 70% during the main sequence. For slow-rotating stars, resonance locking can slow down the rotational evolution of the system over most of the main-sequence phase, even in the presence of strong tidal interactions. This mechanism efficiently drives asynchronisation in binary systems where significant discrepancies already exist between the orbital and rotational frequencies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Friction in Stochastic Inflation</a><span class="id">[2511.21388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We solve time-reversed stochastic inflation in the semi-infinite flat potential with a constant drift term and derive an exact expression for the probability distribution of the curvature fluctuations. It exhibits exponential decaying tails which contrast to the Levy-like power law behaviour encountered without friction. Such a non-vanishing drift acts as a regulator for the conventional “forward” stochastic $\delta N$-formalism, which is otherwise ill-defined in the unbounded and flat potentials typical of plateau models of inflation. This setup therefore allows us to compare the curvature distribution derived from both approaches, reverse and forward in time. Up to similar exponential tails, we find quantitative differences. In particular, in the classical-like limit of very large drift, the tails become Gaussian but only in the time-reversed picture. As a toy model of eternal inflation, we finally discuss the case of negative drift in which inflation never ends for many field trajectories. The forward approach becomes pathological whereas the reverse formalism gives back a finite curvature distribution with always exponential tails. All these differences end up being related to the very definition of the background which is ambiguous when a classical trajectory does not exist.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Nature of High-Redshift Long GRB 250114A and Its Magnetar Central Engine</a><span class="id">[2511.21419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250114A is a long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) which triggered the Swift/BAT with a spectroscopic high-redshift at $z = 4.732$.

While the X-ray light curve exhibits the canonical X-ray emission which is composed of several power-law segments superposition of a giant X-ray flare. More interestingly, there is still significant X-ray emission during the quiescent time in the prompt emission, suggesting a continuously active central engine whose power fluctuates across the $\gamma$-ray detectability threshold.

While one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models with 1D radiative transfer (RT) have been widely used, advances in three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models (GCMs) and 3D RT methods now allow quantitative comparisons of these approaches. With the precision and sensitivity of JWST, such differences can be observationally tested. This study investigates the spectral variations produced by 1D and 3D models and estimates the JWST observing time or number of transits needed to distinguish them. Using HD 189733b as a case study, three sets of simulations were performed: 1D atmospheric models with 1D RT and 3D GCM models coupled with both 1D and 3D RT. An inherent limitation of our study is that the temperature-pressure (T-P) profiles derived from the 3D GCM extend only to the high-pressure regions. The simulations incorporated both equilibrium and disequilibrium chemistry. Significant spectral discrepancies were found, with 3D models generally showing weaker features. Using a JWST noise simulator, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for detecting these differences was calculated. For transmission spectra, the SNR ranged from 2.04-7.68 (equilibrium) and 1.66-7.04 (disequilibrium), while for emission spectra it ranged from 5.90-34.52 (equilibrium) and 7.11-36.93 (disequilibrium). To test the limitations of the 3D GCM, we extended the atmosphere to lower pressures using an isothermal T-P profile and found wavelength-dependent variations in both the spectra and the SNR. These results show that JWST can distinguish 1D from 3D model spectra for major molecular features, underscoring the importance of 3D modeling in interpreting exoplanetary atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compton-induced $γ$-ray Cascade Emissions in Radio Galaxy NGC 1275</a><span class="id">[2511.21463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Among active galactic nuclei (AGNi), blazars are the brightest emitters of high-energy (HE, $E \geq 100$ MeV) to very-high-energy (VHE, $E \geq 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-rays from their jets. Radio galaxies, being the misaligned parent population of the blazar class, were historically not detected at these frequencies.

However, assuming General Relativity in the analysis of large-scale structure could introduce systematic biases if gravity deviates from GR at these scales. Modified gravity theories, such as the Hu-Sawicki formulation of $f(R)$ gravity, offer an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without invoking a cosmological constant, while remaining consistent with Solar System tests through screening mechanisms. In this work, we quantify the cosmological parameter biases that arise when using a combination of galaxy clustering and weak-lensing data-vectors, the so-called 3x2pt analysis, from an $f(R)$ galaxy mock under the incorrect assumption of GR, using for the first time high-fidelity full-sky galaxy mock catalogues. We employ a pair of twin simulations: one with GR and one with Hu–Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity with $|f_{R0}| = 10^{-5}$. The mocks are built using an HOD method to populate the dark matter haloes with galaxies, calibrated against SDSS observations at low redshift. Using conservative scale cuts to minimise modelling uncertainties, we perform 3x2pt analyses and infer cosmological parameters through nested sampling, validating our pipeline with the GR mock. Our results show that when analysing the $f(R)$ galaxy mock assuming GR, the recovered cosmological parameters are very significantly biased, even when considering conservative scale cuts: the Figure of Bias reaches $\sim12\sigma$ for both $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8\}$ and $S_8$. These biases persist even when marginalising over the galaxy bias and baryonic feedback, demonstrating that nuisance parameters cannot absorb the effects of modified gravity. We conclude that incorrectly assuming GR in a universe governed by $f(R)$ gravity leads to severe and detectable biases in cosmological inference for Stage-IV surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21501" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Feasibility of Using Fe XXIII Metastable Transitions as a Density Diagnostic for LMXB Disk Winds</a><span class="id">[2511.21501]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) occasionally show signs of outflowing material from the accretion disk. Studying these outflows can inform the understanding of the geometry of the systems, as well as the dynamics and energetics of accretion. One key variable for determining the location of these disk winds is the density of the outflowing material. In this paper we explore a density diagnostic based upon the absorption of ionizing photons by density-sensitive metastable states of Fe XXIII. This can yield a blue shifted complex of absorption features in the region of $6.61-6.64$ keV. We use the photoionization code {\sc pion} to test how varying the ionizing spectrum affects the detectability and interpretation of these features. We base these ionizing spectral energy distributions on GX 13$+$1 to represent a bright thermally dominated spectrum; 4U 1735$-$44 representing a harder, fainter LMXB spectrum; and MAXI J1820$+$070 representing a black hole LMXB spectrum completely dominated by Comptonized emission. For each of these, we find that the regime where Fe XXIII can be used as a density diagnostic is with an ionization parameter $\log{(\xi/{\rm erg~cm~s^{-1}})}\sim2-3$ and an outflow density $\log{(n_H/{\rm cm^{-3})}}\gtrsim14$. The typical range of ionization parameters for LMXBs indicates that this technique is more feasibly achieved with BH LMXBs than their NS counterparts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21511" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variability of H$α$ chromospheric activity of solar-like stars revealed by the time-domain data of LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey</a><span class="id">[2511.21511]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The variability of H$\alpha$ chromospheric activity of solar-like stars is investigated by using the time-domain data of LAMOST Medium-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey (MRS). We use $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ index (ratio of H$\alpha$ luminosity to bolometric luminosity) to measure the H$\alpha$ activity intensity of a spectrum, and utilize the median of the $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ values of multiple observations ($R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$) as the representative activity intensity of a stellar source. The H$\alpha$ variability of a stellar source is indicated by the extent of $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ fluctuation ($R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$) of multiple observations. Our sample shows that $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ of solar-like stars is about one order of magnitude smaller than $R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$. The distribution of $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ versus $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$ reveals the distinct behaviors between the stellar source categories with lower ($\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median} &lt; -4.85$) and higher ($\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median} &gt; -4.85$) activity intensity. For the former stellar source category, the top envelope of the distribution first increases and then decreases with $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$; while for the latter category, the top envelope of the distribution is largely along a positive correlation line. In addition, for the stellar sources with lower activity intensity, the large-$\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ objects near the top envelope of the $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{EXT}$ versus $\log R_\mathrm{H\alpha}^\mathrm{median}$ distribution tend to have long-term and regular variations of H$\alpha$ activity; while for the stellar sources with higher activity intensity, the H$\alpha$ variations are more likely to be random fluctuations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulations of high-energy neutrino emissions from blazars with the LeHa-Paris code</a><span class="id">[2511.21532]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The identification of astrophysical sources responsible for high-energy cosmic neutrinos has long been a challenge.

This discovery motivated deeper exploration of the theoretical link between photon and neutrino emissions. In this context, simulations of proton-photon interactions in blazars and radiative processes are conducted using advanced numerical codes to predict neutrino spectra. The LeHa-Paris code, previously applied to TXS 0506+056, enables the computation of both leptonic and hadronic components of blazar spectral energy distributions, facilitating exploration of a broad parameter space. In this work, starting from the case of PKS 2155-304, one of the brightest and most studied High-frequency-peaked BL Lacs (HBLs), known for its extreme variability and subject of multi-wavelength observational campaigns, a methodology has been developed to extend neutrino flux templates, optimized via LeHa-Paris, to the full class of HBLs.

In this Letter, we present the first CCSNe simulation incorporating global $\beta$ decay rates from a microscopic theory. These are enabled by a large-scale evaluation of both electron capture and $\beta$ decay rates, obtained self-consistently utilizing the relativistic energy density functional theory and finite-temperature quasiparticle random-phase approximation. We find a significant enhancement of antineutrino emissivity by more than 4 orders of magnitude due to the inclusion of $\beta$ decay rates, as well as 3 orders of magnitude for antineutrino luminosity.

Specifically, we measure the conditional average density, defined as the average density of galaxies observed around a typical galaxy in the sample. To minimize boundary effects, we adopt a conservative criterion: only galaxies for which a spherical volume of radius $r$, centered on them, is fully contained within the survey footprint are included in the computation. For the BGS, we construct four volume-limited subsamples in order to eliminate biases arising from luminosity-dependent selection effects. By contrast, the LRGS is approximately volume-limited by design. The resulting samples span different depths, providing an opportunity to test the stability of statistical measurements across survey volumes of increasing size. Our results show that the conditional average density follows a power-law decay, $\langle n(r) \rangle \propto r^{-0.8}$, without exhibiting any transition to homogeneity within the survey volume. The large statistics of the DESI samples also allow us to demonstrate that finite-size effects become significant as $r$ approaches the boundaries of the sample volumes. Consistently, we find that the distribution of density fluctuations follows a Gumbel distribution - characteristic of extreme-value statistics - rather than a Gaussian distribution, which would be expected for a spatially homogeneous field. These findings confirm and extend the trends previously observed in smaller redshift surveys, supporting the conclusion that the galaxy distribution does not undergo a transition to spatial homogeneity within the probed scales, up to $r \sim 400$ \text{Mpc}/$h$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation and nature of Huntsman binary pulsars</a><span class="id">[2511.21589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spider systems are a class of close binaries in which a neutron star first accretes from a normal companion, and later ablates it in some cases. New observations have expanded this category, with the addition of a Huntsman group, tentatively linked to a short donor phase along the red bump in the secondary evolutionary track. We present explicit evolutionary tracks that support the Huntsman nature recently suggested, and discuss how the whole class of spiders emerges from the full consideration of irradiation and ablating winds. We address the irradiation feedback (IFB) effects and the hydrogen-shell burning detachment (HSBD) simultaneously, and show that they act independently and do not interfere with each other, supporting a physical picture of the Huntsman group. We employ our binary evolution code to compute a suite of binary systems formed by a donor star and a neutron star for different initial orbital periods, assuming solar composition and Z=0.01. Although many models do not consider IFB, we also present the evolution with IFB for one system as an example. We found that the recently suggested association of Huntsman pulsar with the evolutionary stage where (as a consequence of the dynamics of HSBD) the system remains detached for a few million years is plausible. However, this feature alone is unable to account for the occurrence of Redback spider pulsars. Meanwhile, models including IFB, with pulsed mass transfer, display detachment episodes that can be naturally associated with the Redback stage. Irradiation feedback does not preclude or modify HSBD and in fact, Huntsman systems were already present as an implicit prediction in our earlier calculations. We conclude that Huntsman is an expected stage of the spider systems under quite general conditions. This is another step towards a unified picture of spider pulsars as a group.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21611" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transit Timing of the White Dwarf-Cold Jupiter System WD 1856+534</a><span class="id">[2511.21611]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new transit timing measurements for the white dwarf-cold Jupiter system WD 1856+534, extending the baseline of observations from 311 epochs to 1498 epochs. The planet is unlikely to have survived the host star's red-giant phase at its present location and is likely too small for common-envelope evolution to take place. As such, a plausible explanation for the short semimajor axis is that the exoplanet started out on a much larger orbit and then spiraled inward through high-eccentricity tidal migration (HETM). A past transit-timing analysis found tentative evidence for orbital growth, which could have been interpreted as a residual effect of HETM, but we find the data are consistent with a constant-period model after adding 18 new transit measurements. We use the estimated period derivative $\dot{P} = 0.04\pm0.43$ ms yr$^{-1}$ to place a lower limit on the planetary tidal quality factor of $Q_p' \gtrsim 3.1 \times 10^6$, consistent with that of Jupiter in our own Solar System. We also test for the presence of companion planets in the system, which could have excited WD 1856 b onto an eccentric orbit via the Kozai-Lidov process, and ultimately rule out the presence of an additional planet with a mass greater than $4.1\,M_J$ and a period shorter than 1500 days. We find no evidence for nonzero eccentricity, with an upper limit of $e\lesssim10^{-2}$. If the planet indeed reached its current orbit through HETM, the low present-day eccentricity indicates that the migration process has now ceased, and any further orbital evolution will be governed solely by weak planetary tides.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</a><span class="id">[2511.19462]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$.

This vector-tensor theory enjoys stable homogeneous and isotropic solutions characterized by an effective dark energy fluid, with behavior that ranges from freezing quintessential to thawing phantom-like, serving as a motivated framework to scrutinize the cosmological tensions that affect the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. While the model we consider is sufficiently generic to encompass a large class of field theories, it distinguishes itself from scalar dark energy models (quintessential ones, kinetic ones and non-minimally coupled ones) by the presence of what would be classed as a vector degree of freedom which can be for instance inherited from more generic theories of gravity. We improve on previous work in several directions: we consider a general one-parameter class of background models; identify a so-called 'special' model and analyze observational constraints taking also into account perturbations and making use of wide up-to-date catalogs of datasets including recently released ones. We find that the one-parameter Proca-Nuevo model is preferred over $\Lambda$CDM at $1.5\sigma$ when fitting CMB and BAO data, and at $2.4\sigma$ when further adding low-redshift data. The Hubble tension is alleviated, dropping from $5.8\sigma$ to $2.3\sigma$ (resp. $1.5\sigma$) between CMB with (and resp. without) BAO data and local measurements. On the other hand, we find that the vector field generically introduces a significant enhancement of the effective Newton constant, so that matching the observed matter power spectrum requires a mild amount of tuning to suppress the impact of perturbations. Since, at the background level, Proca-Nuevo is degenerate with other classes of theories, our results are also relevant to a wider range of set-ups including and beyond vector-tensor models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Bottom-Up EFT Approach To Superdense Baryonic Matter</a><span class="id">[2511.21141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How to arrive at the densest matter in massive compact stars starting from Walecka's linear $\omega$-$\sigma$ mean-field model is described in a series of arguments anchored on hidden local symmetry, hidden scale symmetry and emergent parity-doublet symmetry.

We also show how the same effect reduces the effective force of gravity at high energy densities in cosmology, leading to a period of early inflation without the need for anything beyond radiation. We also discuss the quantum origin of the universe with a 5D black hole acting as a catalyst for the nucleation of the dark bubble and how it accounts for the present matter content in the universe. This leads to a prediction of $\Omega_c \approx 5\times 10^{-4}$ for a positive curvature of the universe, suggesting an explanation of the why-now-problem of the cosmological constant. We end by speculating on how to incorporate AdS black shells as black hole mimickers within the dark bubble model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Analysis of the Complex Singlet Model with Phase Transition Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2511.21488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the prospects of probing the Complex Singlet Extension of the Standard Model (CxSM) with gravitational waves from the Electroweak phase transition. The study establishes a connection of the scalar potential parameters, the thermodynamic properties of the phase transition, with the directly measured stochastic gravitational-wave background in the presence of astrophysical background and foreground. Considering the space-based gravitational wave detector Taiji, we construct a frequency-domain likelihood that incorporates instrumental and astrophysical noises, and perform both Fisher-matrix forecasts and Bayesian Nested Sampling analysis. The comparison of these two approaches demonstrates consistent parameter recovery and highlights the sensitivity of Taiji to millihertz gravitational-wave signals. We further propagate the inferred constraints on the gravitational-wave spectrum back to the underlying CxSM parameters, obtaining meaningful limits on the Higgs self-couplings. The results emphasize the complementarity between gravitational-wave observations and collider measurements, showing that future missions such as Taiji can serve as a powerful probe of electroweak-scale new physics and the dynamical origin of the Higgs sector.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21499" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The relativistic tidal tensor: general solutions for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes and the Hills mass of naked singularities</a><span class="id">[2511.21499]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The tidal forces experienced on an orbit contain, in principle, information about the underlying spacetime an object is moving through. Astronomical observations often probe the properties of tidal forces in the relativistic regime, and could thus in principle be leveraged to examine the properties of strong-field gravity, provided that a general procedure for computing the relativistic tidal tensor is known. Existing techniques for deriving the tidal tensor rely on cumbersome, case-by-case methods. This paper introduces a unified analytical approach to deriving the tidal accelerations experienced by a test particle in any stationary, axisymmetric spacetime. This technique uses standard relativistic frame transformations and is built around the zero angular momentum observer frame. The method's utility is demonstrated in the four traditional black hole metrics: Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstrom, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman, as well as a particular wormhole metric. As an example of a possible astronomical application of this work, we discuss the concept of the Hills mass, the maximum mass at which a black hole can disrupt a star, and extend its definition to various naked singularity metrics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Implications of the Extended Uncertainty Principle: Energy Conditions, Stability, and Late Time Acceleration</a><span class="id">[2511.21546]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the cosmological consequences of the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP) by deriving modified Friedmann equations through thermodynamic arguments.

Introducing a Majorana fermion $S$ with even lepton parity renders it naturally stable, making it a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. The addition of a lepton parity odd singlet scalar $\sigma$ allows for the coupling $N S \sigma$, where $N$ is the right-handed neutrino. If $S$ is not thermalized, then DM relic can be produced in two distinct ways: (i) for reheating temperature, $T_{\rm rh}&gt;m_{N}$, dominantly through the decay of $N$ ($N\rightarrow S\sigma$), and (ii) for $T_{\rm EW}&lt;T_{\rm rh}\ll m_{N}$, via standard model Higgs ($h$) decay ($h\rightarrow SS$ at one loop). If the $\sigma-h$ quartic coupling is large, then it can lead to a strong first-order electroweak phase transition even if $\langle\sigma\rangle=0$. Alternatively, if $\sigma-h$ coupling is small, then $\sigma$ can freeze out with a larger abundance, and hence its decay ($\sigma\rightarrow S\nu$) at late epochs can give rise to additional relativistic degrees of freedom ($\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$). Thus, the framework gives a viable DM with mass range varying from MeV to TeV and leaves observable imprints, via gravitational waves and $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$, which offer complementary probes, potentially detectable in future gravitational wave and CMB experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nonlinear Hall effect in the stationary cylinder with a radial heat flux</a><span class="id">[2304.13630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A conducting cylinder with a uniform magnetic field along its axis and radial temperature gradient is considered at the stationary state.

This study presents a realistic pipeline to improve $r$ constraints using foreground-cleaned maps with negligible residuals. The pipeline, based on simulations, is adaptable for future experiments. We focus on two delensing approaches: (1) subtracting the gradient-order lensing B-mode template, computed by convolving the E-mode with the lensing potential, from the observed B-mode signal; and (2) remapping observations using the estimated inverse deflection angle. For parameter constraints, we employ three models to reduce $r$ uncertainty and bias, finding consistent uncertainties across models, though biases vary due to the multipole-dependence of the delensing fraction. %We demonstrate the pipeline using simulated maps from future CMB polarization experiments, including a small-aperture (sub-1m) telescope, a large-aperture (6m) telescope, and a future space mission (3m). We demonstrated this pipeline using simulated observation maps from future CMB polarization experiments, which included current representative ground-based small aperture telescopes (sub-1m), next-generation ground-based large aperture telescopes (6m), and highly competitive future space-based medium aperture missions (3m). Results show a delensing efficiency of 40\% with the small-aperture telescope alone, increasing to 65\% when combined with the large-aperture telescope, and 80\% with the satellite mission. These lead to reductions in $r$ uncertainty by 46\% for ground-based and 63\% for space missions.

We present a delensing pipeline designed to enhance the sensitivity to the inflationary parameter r, minimizing reliance on foreground mitigation during lensing reconstruction. Using simulations of Simons Observatory-like CMB observations and Euclid-like LSS surveys in the Northern hemisphere, we demonstrate that excluding low-l modes (l&lt;200) effectively mitigates foreground biases, enabling robust lensing potential reconstruction using observed CMB polarization maps. We reconstruct the lensing potential with a minimum-variance (MV) quadratic estimator (QE) applied to CMB polarization data and combine this with external LSS tracers to improve delensing efficiency. Two complementary methods, the Gradient-order template and the Inverse-lensing approach, are used to generate lensing B-mode templates, which are cross-correlated with observed B-modes. This achieves a 40 percent reduction in the uncertainty of r with CMB-only reconstruction, improving to 60 percent when incorporating external LSS tracers. We validate our results using both the Hamimeche and Lewis likelihood and a Gaussian approximation, finding consistent constraints on r. Our work establishes a streamlined framework for ground-based CMB experiments, demonstrating that synergies with LSS surveys significantly enhance sensitivity to primordial gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time-reversed Stochastic Inflation</a><span class="id">[2504.17680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic inflation may exhibit stochastic periods during which quantum fluctuations dominate over the semi-classical evolution. Extracting observables in these regimes is a notoriously difficult program as quantum randomness makes them fully probabilistic. However, among all the possible quantum histories, the ones which are relevant for Cosmology are conditioned by the requirement that stochastic inflation ended. From an observational point of view, it would be more convenient to model stochastic periods as starting from the time at which they ended and evolving backwards in times. We present a time-reversed approach to stochastic inflation, based on a reverse Fokker-Planck equation, which allows us to derive non-perturbatively the probability distribution of the field values at a given time before the end of the quantum regime. As a motivated example, we solve the flat semi-infinite potential and derive a new and exact formula for the probability distribution of the quantum-generated curvature fluctuations. It is normalisable while exhibiting tails slowly decaying as a Levy distribution. Our reverse-time stochastic formalism could be applied to any inflationary potentials and quantum diffusion eras, including the ones that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Continuous Galactic Line Source of Axions: The Remarkable Case of 23Na</a><span class="id">[2505.03038]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We argue that $^{23}$Na is a potentially significant source of galactic axions.

Odd-A nuclear abundances are typically very low in high-temperature stellar environments (or absent entirely due to burn-up). $^{23}$Na is an exception: $\approx 0.1 M_\odot$ of the isotope is synthesized during carbon burning then maintained at $\approx 10^9$K for times ranging up to $6 \times 10^4$y. Using MESA simulations, a galactic model, and sampling over progenitor masses, locations, and evolutionary stages, we find a continuous flux at earth of $\langle \phi_a \rangle \approx 22$/cm$^2$s for $g^\mathrm{eff}_{aNN} = 10^{-9}$. Some fraction of these axions convert to photons as they propagate through the galactic magnetic field, producing a distinctive 440 keV line $\gamma$ ray detectable by all-sky detectors like the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). Assuming a 1$\mu$G galactic magnetic field and a sufficiently light axion mass, we find that COSI will be able to probe $| g_{aNN}^\mathrm{eff} g_{a \gamma \gamma} | \gtrsim1.8 \times 10^{-22}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $3\sigma$ after two years of surveying.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impact of $Ω_{m0}$ Prior Bias on Cosmological Parameter Estimation: Reconciling DESI DR2 BAO and Pantheon+ SNe Data Combination Results</a><span class="id">[2506.16022]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent cosmological parameter analyses combining DESI DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data with external probes, such as Pantheon+ Supernovae (SNe) observations, have reported deviations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameters ($\oo, \oa$) from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model predictions ($\oo=-1, \oa=0$). A notable aspect of these results is the role of $\Omo$ prior information from SNe, which is known to exhibit tension with BAO-only constraints. In this study, we rigorously investigate this effect through a statistical analysis using 1000 mock DESI DR2 BAO data realizations. We demonstrate that the strong degeneracy between $\oo$, $\oa$, and $\Omo$ causes significant biases in the estimated dark energy parameters when the $\Omo$ prior mean deviates from its true underlying value. Specifically, applying an $\Omo$ prior mean of 0.33 (consistent with some SNe-only constraints) to mock data, assuming a true $\Lambda$CDM universe ($\Omo=0.30, \oo=-1, \oa=0$), yields biased estimates such as $\oo \approx -0.82 \pm 0.06$ and $\oa \approx -0.82 \pm 0.4$. This systematic shift, driven by the $\Omo$ prior, moves the estimated parameters towards the non-$\Lambda$CDM region, offering a qualitative resemblance to outcomes reported in current combined DESI DR2 BAO + Pantheon+ SNe analyses (e.g., $\oo = -0.888^{+0.055}_{-0.064}$, $\oa = -0.17 \pm 0.46$). Our findings suggest that these observed non-$\Lambda$CDM parameters may largely arise from statistical biases due to $\Omo$ prior tensions between datasets. This study proposes a potential resolution to current cosmological tensions without necessarily invoking new physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on charged particles and photon production in astrophysical sources</a><span class="id">[2507.06766]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions.

Both observations and modern theoretical models show that such stars have highly structured and variable atmospheres and winds. We present first spectral synthesis based on 3D time-dependent unified RHD model atmospheres with winds for O stars. We first carried out time-dependent, 3D simulations of unified atmospheres with winds. We then used 3D radiative transfer to compute surface brightness maps for the optical continuum as well as integrated flux profiles for select diagnostic lines. To derive occupation numbers and source functions, an aNLTE method was used, as well as scattering source functions. Our continuum intensity maps of a prototypical early O star reveal a highly variable and time-dependent surface, characterised by local emergent radiation temperature variations. Our averaged synthetic line profiles of optical absorption lines have large widths, without applying any macro- or microturbulence. From the simulations we find correspondingly large velocity dispersions in the photospheric layers. Additionally, the absorption line EWs are larger than for comparable 1D models. First results using scattering source functions further demonstrate that characteristic features like the softening of the blue edge of strong ultra-violet wind lines are qualitatively well-reproduced by our models. Our 3D simulations clearly predict a highly structured and strongly variable O star surface. First line profile results further suggest that several observed features are naturally reproduced by our models without the need to introduce ad-hoc spectral fitting parameters. We also discuss how using 3D rather than 1D simulations as a basis for future studies may affect the derivation of fundamental stellar parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13811" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing the cosmic distance duality relation with baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae data</a><span class="id">[2507.13811]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the most fundamental relationships in modern cosmology is the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), which describes the relationship between the angular diameter distance ($D_{\rm A}$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$), and is expressed as: $\eta(z)=D_{\rm L}(z)(1+z)^{-2}/D_{\rm A}(z)=1$. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive test of the CDDR by combining baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the SDSS and DESI surveys with type Ia supernova (SN) data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We utilize an artificial neural network approach to match the SN and BAO data at the same redshift. To explore potential violations of the CDDR, we consider three different parameterizations: (i) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z$; (ii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0z/(1+z)$; (iii) $\eta(z)=1+\eta_0\ln(1+z)$. Our results indicate that the calibration of the SN absolute magnitude $M_{\rm B}$ plays a crucial role in testing potential deviations from the CDDR, as there exists a significant negative correlation between $\eta_0$ and $M_{\rm B}$. For PantheonPlus analysis, when $M_{\rm B}$ is treated as a free parameter, no evidence of CDDR violation is found. In contrast, fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm D20}$ prior with $-19.230\pm0.040$ mag leads to a deviation at approximately the $2\sigma$ level, while fixing $M_{\rm B}$ to the $M_{\rm B}^{\rm B23}$ prior with $-19.396\pm0.016$ mag remains in agreement with the CDDR. Furthermore, overall analyses based on the SDSS+DESY5 and DESI+DESY5 data consistently show no evidence of the deviation from the CDDR.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21867" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma rays as leptonic portals to energetic neutrinos: a new Monte Carlo approach</a><span class="id">[2507.21867]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High center-of-mass electromagnetic (EM) interactions could produce decaying heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation.

For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \; \text{eV}$ scattering background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator.

We extract the eclipse spectrum of WASP-121b with two independent data reduction pipelines and analyse it using different atmospheric retrieval prescriptions to explore the effects of thermal dissociation, reflected light, and titanium condensation on the inferred atmospheric properties. We find that the observed dayside spectrum of WASP-121b is best fit by atmosphere models possessing a stratospheric inversion with temperatures reaching over 3000K, with spectral contributions from H2O, CO, VO, H-, and either TiO or reflected light. We measure the atmosphere of WASP-121b to be metal enriched ( 10x stellar) but comparatively titanium poor ( 1x stellar), potentially due to partial cold-trapping. The inferred C/O depends on model assumptions such as whether reflected light is included, ranging from being consistent with stellar if a geometric albedo of zero is assumed to being super-stellar for a freely fitted Ag = 0.16 +/- 0.02. The volatile-to-refractory ratio is measured to be consistent with the stellar value. We infer that WASP-121b has an atmosphere enriched in both volatile and refractory metals, but not in ultra-refractory titanium, suggesting the presence of a nightside cold-trap. Considering H2O dissociation is critical in free retrieval analyses, leading to order-of-magnitude differences in retrieved abundances for WASP-121b if neglected. Simple chemical equilibrium retrievals assuming that all species are governed by a single metallicity parameter drastically overpredict the TiO abundance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstructing the local density field with combined convolutional and point cloud architecture</a><span class="id">[2510.08573]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field.

Three alternative models (i.e. dissipative photosphere, internal shock, and Internal-Collision-induced MAgnetic Reconnection and Turbulence, ICMART) have been proposed to interpret the observations of GRB prompt emission, but none of them can fully interpret all of the observational data collected so far. The question is what is the fraction of these three theoretical models in the prompt emission of GRBs. In this paper, we propose to utilize an innovative method and constrain the fraction of GRB prompt emission models via its nondetected diffuse neutrinos. By adopting two methods (e.g., summing up the individual GRB contributions and assumed luminosity functions of GRB) to calculate diffuse neutrino flux of GRBs for given the benchmark parameters of $\Gamma=300$ and $\varepsilon_{p} \text{/} \varepsilon_{e}=10$, both approaches indicate that most GRBs should be originated from the ICMART model. Moreover, we find that the fractions of the dissipative photosphere model, the internal shock model, and the ICMART model are constrained to be [0, $0.5\%$], [0, $1.1\%$], and [$98.9\%$, 1], respectively, for the method of summing up the individual GRB contributions. For the method of luminosity functions, the fractions of above three models are constrained to be [0, $6.1\%$], [0, $8.2\%$], and [$91.8\%$, 1], respectively. However, such fractions of different models are also dependent on the parameters of $\Gamma$ and $\varepsilon_{p} \text{/} \varepsilon_{e}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12488" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The first AKRA mass map reconstruction from HSC Y1 data</a><span class="id">[2511.12488]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Weak lensing mass-mapping from shear catalogs faces systematic challenges from survey masks and spatially varying noise.

The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermal Evolution of Magnetars under f(R, T) Gravity</a><span class="id">[2412.04520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The present study explores the thermal evolution and emission properties of neutron stars within the framework of modified $f(R, T)$ gravity by solving the coupled energy-balance and heat-transport equations. We compute stellar mass and pressure profiles by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations in both Einstein gravity and modified gravity, employing the APR, FPS, and SLy equations of state, with and without the strong magnetic field. Using these profiles, we assess the red-shifted surface temperature, $T_s^{\infty}$, as well as the photon and neutrino luminosities for each equation of state. We further examine the effects of the magnetic field, the choice of equation of state, and the underlying gravity theory framework on the cooling of neutron stars, particularly those of magnetized neutron stars or magnetars. Our results indicate that $f(R, T)$ gravity, particularly for the APR and SLy equations of state, exhibits improved agreement with the observed $T_s^{\infty}$ and photon luminosities than standard general relativity, regardless of magnetic-field strength. Moreover, it predicts the neutrino luminosities under both gravity models, all the chosen equations of state, and magnetic field configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</a><span class="id">[2506.03506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22346" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Symmetry principles of gravitational perturbations in thermal environments</a><span class="id">[2510.22346]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The thermal plasma induces a plasmon-like mass shift for gravitational perturbations, which can modify their dynamics near the horizon scale in the early radiation-dominated universe. However, there are several seemingly reasonable ways to introduce this mass shift, reflecting an ambiguity in how one specifies the initial plasma state on a perturbed FLRW background. Invariance under small diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings singles out the (grand) canonical ensemble defined in the decoupling limit of gravitational interactions, while excluding ensembles that violate the Weyl identity, including those perturbed by the metric. Large diffeomorphisms further require the mass shift to vanish in the infrared limit. With this consistent choice, primordial tensor modes exhibit stable damping, in agreement with Weinberg's kinetic theory analysis. This cosmological example indicates a more general picture in which local equilibrium in thermal quantum field theory is not an external input but an emergent, dynamical notion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23738" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">String Decomposition and Gravitational Waves in High-quality Axion Gauge Theories</a><span class="id">[2510.23738]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.</p></div></details></article></body>
