Violent mergers, where the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary white dwarf smashes onto it while being disrupted on its last orbit, were the first proposed double degenerate merger scenario that ignites dynamically. However, violent mergers likely contribute only a few per cent to the total Type Ia supernova rate and do not yield normal Type Ia supernova light curves. Here we revisit the scenario, simulating a violent merger with better methods, and in particular a more accurate treatment of the detonation. We find good agreement with previous simulations, with one critical difference. The secondary white dwarf, being disrupted and accelerated towards the primary white dwarf, and impacted by its explosion, does not fully burn. Its core survives as a bound object. The explosion leaves behind a $0.16\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ carbon-oxygen white dwarf travelling $2800\,\mathrm{km/s}$, making it an excellent (and so far the only) candidate to explain the origin of the fastest observed hyper-velocity white dwarfs. We also show that before the explosion, $5\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ of material consisting predominantly of helium, carbon, and oxygen has already been ejected at velocities above $1000\,\mathrm{km/s}$. Finally, we argue that if a violent merger made D6-1 and D6-3, and violent mergers require the most massive primary white dwarfs in binaries of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, there has to be a much larger population of white dwarf mergers with slightly lower-mass primary white dwarfs. Because of its size, this population can essentially only give rise to normal Type Ia supernovae, likely exploding via the quadruple detonation channel and leaving no bound object behind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spin and Obliquity Distributions of Low-mass Planets Shaped by Dynamical Instability</a><span class="id">[2510.11785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exoplanetary systems hosting multiple low-mass planets are thought to have experienced dynamical instability, during which planet-planet collisions and mergers occur; these collisions can impart substantial amount of angular momentum to the merger remnants, changing the obliquities of the resulting planets significantly. In this work, we carry out a series of $N$-body experiments to investigate the spin magnitude $(|\vec{S}|)$ and obliquity $(\theta_{\rm SL})$ distributions of low-mass exoplanets that have gone through planetary collisions. In our fiducial super-Earth (with $m=3M_{\oplus}$, $R=1.3R_{\oplus}$) and mini-Neptune systems (with $m=9M_{\oplus}$, $R=2.5R_{\oplus}$), the collision products follow a nearly uniform distribution in $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}$ and the spin-magnitude distribution is approximately linear in $|\vec{S}|$. Parameter studies and theoretical analysis show that increasing planetary radii or masses, or decreasing the initial planet-planet mutual inclinations, tend to polarize the obliquity distribution toward alignment or anti-alignment (i.e., excess probability near $\cos{\theta_{\rm SL}}=\pm1$). Experiments with initially two-planet and three-planet systems produce qualitatively similar outcomes, suggesting that the trends in this study may generalize to systems with higher planetary multiplicities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for GEMS: TOI-5916 b &amp; TOI-6158 b are two Saturn-density planets orbiting M2 dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.11798]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We confirm the planetary nature of (1) TOI-5916 b and (2) TOI-6158 b, two Exoplanets Transiting M-dwarf Stars (GEMS), both discovered by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Both systems were confirmed with ground-based photometry (Red Buttes Observatory and Swope, respectively) and radial velocity data from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder. Their radii are $R_{1}=11.8^{+0.52}_{-0.51}\text{ }R_{\oplus}$ and $R_{2}=10.4^{+2.70}_{-1.11}\text{ }R_{\oplus}$ and masses are $M_{1}=219\pm28\text{ }M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{2}=135^{+19}_{-18}\text{ }M_{\oplus}$. Both planets have Saturn-like densities ($\rho_{1} = 0.73^{+0.14}_{-0.13}\,\text{g cm}^{-3}$, $\rho_{2} = 0.66^{+0.41}_{-0.23}\,\text{g cm}^{-3}$), which appears to be a growing trend among GEMS systems and, more generally, warm Jupiters. In confirming both of these exoplanets, we add to the growing evidence for a population of Saturn-density planets among the GEMS systems. We also find evidence for a preliminary trend in which GEMS exhibit systematically closer orbits compared to FGK giants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eruptive mass loss less than a year before the explosion of superluminous supernovae. II. A systematic search for pre-explosion eruptions with VLT/X-shooter</a><span class="id">[2510.11799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present X-shooter observations of a sample of 21 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I), spanning a redshift range of z=0.13-0.95, aimed at searching for shells of circumstellar material (CSM). Specifically, we focus on identifying broad Mg II absorption features that are blueshifted by several thousand kilometers per second and have previously been interpreted as arising from resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding CSM ejected shortly before explosion. Utilizing high-quality spectra, we model the region around 2800A to characterize the Mg II line profiles, enabling us to either confirm their presence or place constraints on undetected CSM shells. We identify five objects in our sample that show broad Mg II absorption features consistent with the presence of CSM. While SN2018ibb, SN2020xga and SN2022xgc have been previously reported, we identify previously undiscovered CSM shells in DES15S2nr and DES16C3ggu. These shells were likely expelled approximately two and three months, respectively, before the explosion of their associated SNe, timescales consistent with late-stage mass-loss episodes. We do not find any correlations between the shell properties and the SN properties, except for a marginal correlation between the light curve decline time scale and the shell velocities. We further demonstrate that CSM configurations similar to the majority of the detected shells would have been observable in spectra with signal-to-noise &gt;8 per resolution element, and that the lines from a shell are in general detectable except in the cases where the shell is either very geometrically and/or optically thin. Therefore, we conclude that the detection of CSM shells is not a selection effect, but may instead point to the existence of a subclass of SLSNe-I undergoing late-stage shell ejections shortly before explosion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11802" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wind and nearby stellar environment of the quiescent luminous blue variable Var 2 in the Galaxy M33</a><span class="id">[2510.11802]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper is dedicated to the study of the luminous blue variable (LBV) Var 2 in the galaxy M33, which is currently in a &quot;dormant&quot; state and is observed as an Of/late-WN star. We had calculated self-consistent hydrodynamic non-LTE models of the extended atmosphere, taking into account the balance of radial forces in the wind of the star. This allowed us to obtain reliable estimates of the fundamental parameters of Var 2. The derived luminosity ($L=6.5\times10^{5}\,L_\odot$), current mass ($M_* \approx23\,M_\odot$) and hydrogen abundance on the surface (${\rm X}_{\rm H}\approx43\%$) correspond well to a star with the initial mass $M_{\rm init}\approx50\,M_\odot$ and age $t_{\rm age}\approx5.0\times10^6\,$years that is evolving from lower temperatures towards the Wolf-Rayet stars. A study of dynamic properties of the wind showed that the shape of the wind velocity profile of the Var 2 is close to the one of OB supergiants. In contrast, for the obtained mass loss rate $\dot{M}=2.1\times10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$, the ratio of the wind momentum to the luminosity of Var 2 is in good agreement with the values found for late-WN stars. At the same time, Var 2 has a lower terminal wind velocity $v_\infty\approx230\,$km$\,$s$^{-1}$ compared to typical early-type supergiants or late-WN stars. Given the obtained age estimates, Var 2 could potentially have been ejected from the cluster associated with the nearest large star-forming region located at a distance of $\sim100\,$pc. However, statistical analysis of the projected distribution of stars in the vicinity of Var 2 suggests that this LBV could have formed in a local low-populated group.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Preferential accretion of binary stars</a><span class="id">[2510.11805]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The attracting properties of gravity enable matter present in cores to collapse into stars with seven orders of magnitude change in space and time making modelling of star formation a challenging multi-scale process. To circumvent this scale problem stars are replaced by a sub-grid sink particle at a much larger scale. Sink particles are created above a threshold density and acquire mass and momentum through accretion. In models where binary star systems form and migrate to separations of a few cells, the accretion flow is unresolved and the relative accretion rate to the sink particles may become inaccurate. We introduce a new recipe for accretion onto binary sink particles that have overlapping accretion regions and implement an algorithm to track the angular momentum of sink particles as a proxy for the stellar spin. Our preferential binary accretion recipe uses a virtual binary sink particle for the purpose of accretion and redistribute the accreted mass onto the sink particles according to results from models investigating binary accretion in detail. This solves problems common to current algorithms in many codes: (i) accretion is not suppressed due to large velocity differences between gas and stars, when that velocity is only internal to the binary system, (ii) the accretion rates are smoother for the unresolved close binaries in eccentric orbits, and (iii) non-physical suppression of accretion onto the secondary sink particle when the primary dominates the potential is eliminated. We test our implementation by comparing simulations at increasing resolution until the binaries are resolved. While not perfect, it mitigates undesired properties of current algorithms and in particularly for global models of starforming regions. It may also be applied to other unresolved accreting binaries, such as compact objects in clusters and binary supermassive black holes in cosmological models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hubble reveals complex multi-scale structure in the edge-on protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707</a><span class="id">[2510.11819]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution (&lt;0.1&quot;) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of the near edge-on (i 80 deg) protoplanetary disk IRAS 23077+6707 (&quot;Dracula's Chivito&quot;) obtained across six broadband filters spanning 0.4-1.6 microns. These observations unveil the scattered light from this unusually large disk ( 14&quot;, or  4200 au at 300 pc) in remarkable detail, revealing a rich tapestry of substructure, including brightness asymmetries and signatures of dynamical activity. Extended filaments are detected extending  10&quot; from the northern edges of both nebulae, while no comparable southern features are observed. In addition to large-scale asymmetries, the disk exhibits prominent wispy features that extend well above the midplane and are visible in all filters, suggesting a complex, possibly turbulent outer disk atmosphere shaped by infall, dynamical stirring, or gravitational instability. The central dark lane narrows from optical to near-IR wavelengths, and high-resolution millimeter data reveal compact midplane emission. Although our radiative transfer simulations show that the current data cannot yet distinguish between dust-settling and no-settling scenarios, they underscore the need for deeper observations of this unique system. IRAS 23077+6707 thus represents a rare and valuable laboratory for studying the vertical structure, asymmetries, and evolutionary state of protoplanetary disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolutionary Links: From Gaia Neutron Star Binaries to Pulsar White Dwarf Endpoints</a><span class="id">[2510.11828]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of wide, eccentric Gaia neutron stars (NSs) in binaries with still evolving (likely main sequence) companions offers a new probe of mass transfer and pulsar recycling beyond the compact-binary regime. We model their origins and fates using population synthesis with POSYDON and detailed binary evolution with MESA, contrasting two limiting prescriptions at Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF): enforced circularization versus explicitly eccentric mass transfer. Our MESA setups include updated treatments of eccentric, non-conservative transfer, magnetic-braking torques for cool stars, and neutron-star spin evolution with accretion and dipole spindown. Under optimistic assumptions, isolated evolution yields Gaia-like systems at only &lt;1.5% relative rates of NS-evolving companion binaries, yet absolute numbers remain consistent with detections for continuous star formation. Synthetic populations indicate that many canonical millisecond pulsar-white dwarf (WD) binaries arise from unstable mass transfer and common envelope recycling, whereas Gaia systems typically avoid common envelope and only undergo stable mass transfer. In the case of capping accretion onto the NS at the Eddington rate, circular RLOF keeps the donor's mass-loss rate hovering around the Eddington limit and sustained over long timescales. Eccentric mass transfer instead produces briefer bursty signatures where the donor's mass-loss rate can climb up to a thousand times higher than in the circular case. The eccentric channel then leaves wide, eccentric NS-helium WD binaries with only mild recycling, whereas the circular channel yields long-lived transfer, circular NS-WD binaries (helium or carbon-oxygen core), and fully recycled millisecond pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11855" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The resilience of the sailboat stable region</a><span class="id">[2510.11855]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Binary systems host complex orbital dynamics where test particles can occupy stable regions despite strong gravitational perturbations. The sailboat region, discovered in the Pluto-Charon system, allows highly eccentric S-type orbits at intermediate distances between the two massive bodies. This region challenges traditional stability concepts by supporting eccentricities up to 0.9 in a zone typically dominated by chaotic motion. We investigate the sailboat region's existence and extent across different binary system configurations. We examine how variations in mass ratio, secondary body eccentricity, particle inclination, and argument of pericenter affect this stable region. We performed 1.2 million numerical simulations of the elliptic three-body problem to generate four datasets exploring different parameter spaces. We trained XGBoost machine learning models to classify stability across approximately $10^9$ initial conditions. We validated our results using Poincaré surface of section and Lyapunov exponent analysis to confirm the dynamical mechanisms underlying the stability. The sailboat region exists only for binary mass ratios $\mu = [0.05, 0.22]$. Secondary body eccentricity severely constrains the region, following an exponential decay: $e_{s,\mathrm{max}} \approx 0.016 + 0.614 \exp(-25.6\mu)$. The region tolerates particle inclinations up to $90^\circ$ and persists in retrograde configurations for $\mu \leq 0.16$. Stability requires specific argument of pericenter values within $\pm 10^\circ$ to $\pm 30^\circ$ of $\omega = 0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$. Our machine learning models achieved over 97\% accuracy in predicting stability. The sailboat region shows strong sensitivity to system parameters, particularly secondary body eccentricity. Among Solar System dwarf planet binaries, Pluto-Charon, Orcus-Vanth and Varda-Ilmarë systems could harbor such regions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetic Decay Index Profile and Coronal Mass Ejection Speed</a><span class="id">[2510.11889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the relationship between the speed of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and the height profile of the ambient magnetic field, quantified by its decay index, n(h). Our sample is composed of 15 very fast CMEs (Vcme &gt; 1500 km/s; all halo CMEs) and 22 halo CMEs below this speed limit from Solar Cycle 23. The very fast CMEs yield a high correlation of 0.81 between Vcme and the slope of n(h) in a height range above the onset height of the torus instability if one extremely fast outlier, which closely followed another very fast CME, is excluded. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the torus instability plays a decisive role in CME acceleration. The whole sample yields a weaker correlation, which is still significant if events with a broad torus-stable dip in n(h) are excluded. A parametric simulation study of flux-rope eruptions from quadrupolar and two-scale bipolar source regions confirms the decelerating effect of such dips. Very fast, moderate-velocity, and confined eruptions are found.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Systematic North-South asymmetry in the Steady-state Climate of rapidly-rotating Oblique Water Worlds</a><span class="id">[2510.11904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary obliquity (axial tilt) plays an important role in regulating the climate evolution and habitability of water-covered planets. Despite the suspicion of large obliquities in several exoplanetary systems, this phenomenon remains hard to observe directly. We aimed to study the effect of mass, obliquity, and rotation on the steady state climate of water-covered planets. We simulated the climate evolution of such planets with varying obliquities, rotational speed, and mass using a general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, assuming aqua-planet configurations. High obliquity supports an asymmetry between the equilibrium climatological conditions in the northern and southern hemispheres. The polar temperature ratio deviates further from unity with increasing obliquity and rotation rate. Cloud coverage patterns also shift with obliquity, displaying distinct latitudinal bands and increased cloudiness in the warmer hemisphere. The climate of habitable-zone aqua-planets turns out to be sensitive to changes in obliquity and rotation rate, but are independent of planet mass. Our results highlight the importance of considering these factors when assessing the surface conditions of exoplanets. As a consequence, surface condition asymmetries in water-world exo-planets can be used to infer the planet's obliquity and rotation rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultraviolet radiation and neutrinos: two messengers from CCSNe in the CSM scenario</a><span class="id">[2510.11916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars (&gt;8 $M_{\odot}$) often undergo intense mass loss through winds or eruptive events in the final stages of their evolution, leading to the formation of a dense circumstellar medium (CSM). This material, expelled months to years before core collapse, shapes the pre-explosion environment and influences the early supernova (SN) emission. In particular, the interaction of the SN ejecta with the dense CSM can power an extended emission into the UV/optical bands, as seen in a growing fraction of type II SN. Recent events such as SN 2023ixf and SN 2024ggi confirm the relevance of dense environments and highlight the value of UV observations. Moreover, Fast Blue Optical Transients (FBOTs) may represent extreme cases of this interaction, possibly linked to more compact/massive CSM. In this work, we model the SN-CSM shock interaction in order to (i) estimate the maximum detection horizons and expected rates for future UV missions like ULTRASAT, and (ii) to estimate the intensity and expected rate of potential neutrino signals detectable by IceCube and KM3NeT. We then discuss the prospects for multi-messenger observations of such events in the near future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11922" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Abundances of Rarely Detected s-process Elements Derived from the Ultraviolet Spectrum of the s-process-enhanced Metal-poor Star HD 196944</a><span class="id">[2510.11922]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of the heavy-element abundances of HD 196944, a carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) star enriched with elements produced by the slow neutron-capture process (s-process). We obtained a new high-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of this star, the UV-brightest known CEMP-s star, with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on board the Hubble Space Telescope. This spectrum extends deeper into the UV (2029 &lt; lambda &lt; 2303 Angstroms) than previous studies of any CEMP-s star. When combined with previous UV and optical analysis, a total of 35 elements heavier than zinc (Z = 30) can be detected in HD 196944, and upper limits are available for nine other heavy elements. The abundances can be well fit by models of s-process nucleosynthesis operating in a low-mass companion star that evolved through the asymptotic giant branch phase and transferred heavy elements to HD 196944. This s-process event did not contribute substantially to the Ga, Ge, or As abundances (31 &lt;= Z &lt;= 33).

We employ a suite of three-dimensional global climate model (GCM) simulations to (1) map the inner boundary of the habitable zone of Teegarden's Star b and (2) characterize its surface climate under the assumption of an Earth-analog atmosphere. Our simulations show that, with its most recently estimated instellation of 1481 Wm^-2, Teegarden's Star b remains below the runaway greenhouse threshold for both low (as=0.07, ocean-dominated) and moderate (as=0.30, land-dominated) surface albedos. However, a different estimate of 1565 Wm^-2 places it beyond the runaway threshold. The result that Teegarden's Star b is habitable under the most recent instellation measurement reinforces its status as one of the most compelling targets for future habitability and biosignature searches. Given the planet's proximity to the runaway threshold, it would benefit from a comparative study done with other models using different parameterizations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotation of Polarization Angle in Gamma-Ray Burst Prompt Phase.

In addition to polarization curve and polarization spectrum, studies of polarization angle (PA) rotation spectrum is also crucial. In this paper, we use a simple parametric magnetic reconnection model with a large-scale aligned magnetic field in the radiation region to study the effects of field orientation on the PA rotations. Under different field orientations, variations of the PA rotation with parameters and the PA rotation spectra are studied. We find that the conclusions obtained in our previous works are almost independent of the field orientations. The area of the parameter space with $\Delta$PA $&gt;10^\circ$ will shrink as the value of field orientation ($\delta$) increases for $0^\circ&lt;\delta&lt;90^\circ$. The $\Delta$PA values would be the same for two complementary field orientations. For two particular magnetic field orientations ($\delta=0^\circ$ and $90^\circ$), the $\Delta$PA would also only be $0^\circ$ or $90^\circ$ within the burst duration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11988" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Cosmic Ray Acceleration on the Early Evolution of Bow Shocks around Massive Runaway Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.11988]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bow shocks generated from the interaction of winds from massive runaway stars with the interstellar medium have been shown to be prominent particle accelerators through recent $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron observations. Here, we study particle acceleration from bow shocks by conducting 3D ideal cosmic ray magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the advection-diffusion limit. We use the Eulerian grid-based code FLASH, where stellar winds are injected through tabulated wind velocities and mass loss rates. We implement a gradient-based shock detection algorithm to resolve the shocked regions where the CRs are injected dynamically. Simulations are performed for different values of the CR diffusion coefficient and star velocities within an ISM-like environment up to 180 kyr to showcase the impact of dynamical CR injection on the early evolution of the wind-driven bow shock. With a simplified spectral model in post-processing, we calculate the expected upper limits of $\gamma$-ray and synchrotron emission and compare with those from current observations. We observe that variations of CR diffusion rates can strongly dictate the morphology of the bow shock and the overall $\gamma$-ray and radio synchrotron luminosity due to the balance between the CR injection efficiency and diffusion. Our results yield qualitatively comparable results with current observations, primarily attributed to the high-energy protons and electrons contributing to non-thermal emission from efficient acceleration at the forward shock through the approximations and assumptions in the injection algorithm. We conclude that CR acceleration, with varying CR diffusion rates, may substantially affect the morphology of wind-driven bow shocks and their non-thermal emission, if there is efficient particle acceleration in the forward shock.

In a prior paper, we set forth an empirical mineralogy mid-IR spectral model that conveyed spatial information and worked in tandem with a radiative transfer model, which formed the EaRTH Disk Model. In this article, we take the empirical portion of that model, the TZTD model, and refine it with a newly derived protoplanetary disk thermal emission formulation which uses a temperature distribution without requiring discrete integration; this simplified model uses an empirical relation between spatial distribution variables, which permits radiative transfer models to directly fit these spatial distribution variables more freely within the provided empirical constraints. We test this model against several $Spitzer~Space~Telescope$ Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra, primarily transition disks, and discuss the mineralogical and structural implications of the fits, including the implications for grain growth and processing within the atmospheric zones of the disks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12134" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eternal inflation bubble collision signature on CMB remote dipole and quadrupole fields</a><span class="id">[2510.12134]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The remote dipole and quadrupole fields (RDF/RQF) encode information about the observable universe as seen from remote places within our past light cone. Sensitive to the superhorizon inhomogeneites, they provide a unique way to probe physics at the largest scales, bypassing the limitations of cosmic variance inherent in the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB). In this work, we focus on the bubble collision predicted by the eternal inflation theory, which can leave distinct azimuthally symmetric patterns on the superhorizon scales, potentially detectable through the RDF and RQF. We present the first analytic expression of the RQF signal induced by bubble collision and validate it against numerical calculations performed with $\texttt{RemoteField}$, a new public software tool we developed, finding excellent agreement between the two. Combining our new RQF calculation with the corresponding RDF signal calculated by prior work, we forecast the constraining power on bubble collision parameters using RDF/RQF reconstruction. We find that, for an CMB-S4-like and an LSST-like experiment, the RDF reconstruction can provide comparable constraining power as that from the primary CMB alone; and the RQF reconstruction can improve the constraining power by about an order of magnitude. We argue that these constraints can be improved further by including more RDF/RQF multipoles included and by using tomographic techniques to mitigate the standard $\Lambda$CDM signal. We anticipate the framework we developed in this work to be broadly applicable to probe other superhorizon-scale physics, such as cosmic topology and domain walls.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polar Filaments Capture High Latitude Solar Poloidal Field Interactions and can Foretell the Future Sunspot Cycle Amplitude before Polar Field Precursors</a><span class="id">[2510.12142]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polar fields at the minimum of a sunspot cycle – which are a manifestation of the radial component of the Sun's poloidal field – are deemed to be the best indicator of the strength of the toroidal component, and hence the amplitude of the future sunspot cycle. However, the Sun's polar magnetic fields are difficult to constrain with ground-based or space-based observations from near the plane-of-ecliptic. In this context, polar filaments – dark, elongated structures that overlie polarity inversion lines – are known to offer critical insights into solar polar field dynamics. Through investigations of the long-term evolution of polar filament areas and length acquired from the Meudon Observatory and complimentary solar surface flux transport simulations, here we establish the common physical foundation connecting the Babcock-Leighton solar dynamo mechanism of solar polar field reversal and build-up with the origin and evolution of polar filaments. We discover a new relationship connecting the residual filament area of adjacent solar cycles with the amplitude of the next sunspot cycle – which can serve as a new tool for solar cycle forecasts – advancing the forecast window to earlier than polar field based precursors. We conclude that polar filament properties encapsulate the physics of interaction of the poloidal magnetic field of the previous and current sunspot cycles, the resultant of which is the net poloidal magnetic field at the end of the current cycle, thus encoding as a precursor the strength of the upcoming solar cycle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Violent mergers can explain the inflated state of some of the fastest stars in the Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2510.12197]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A significant number of hypervelocity stars with velocities between $1500-2500$ km/s have recently been observed. The only plausible explanation so far is that they have been produced through thermonuclear supernovae in white dwarf binaries. Since these stars are thought to be surviving donors of Type Ia supernovae, a surprising finding was that these stars are inflated, with radii an order of magnitude more than expected for Roche-lobe filling donors. Recent attempts at explaining them have combined 3-dimensional hydrodynamical supernova explosion simulations with 1-dimensional stellar modelling to explain the impact of supernova shocks on runaway white dwarfs. However, only the hottest and most compact of those runaway stars can so far marginally be reproduced by detailed models of runaways from supernova explosions. In this and a companion paper, we introduce a new \textsc{Arepo} simulation of two massive CO white dwarfs that explode via a violent merger. There, the primary white dwarf ignites when the secondary is on its last orbit and plunging towards the primary. In the corresponding aftermath, the core of the secondary white dwarf of 0.16 M$_\odot$, remains bound, moving at a velocity of $\sim2800$ km/s. We map this object into MESA, and show that this runaway star can explain the observations of two hypervelocity stars that were dubbed D6-1 and D6-3 based on their original discovery motivated by the D6 scenario, though the violent merger scenario presented here is somewhat distinct from the D6 scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12296" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spatio-Temporal Evolution of the March 2022 ICME Revealed by Multi-Point Observations of Forbush Decreases</a><span class="id">[2510.12296]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) cause Forbush Decreases (FDs) effects, which are local decreases in background galactic cosmic rays (GCR). Even though FDs can be observed with simple particle instruments, their amplitude and shape provide physical profiles of passing ICMEs. However, in some cases, previous statistical studies of the heliocentric distance dependence of FD changes associated with ICME propagation have found no strong correlation. We need the criteria for evaluating the relationship between ICMEs structure and FD, necessary for FDs statistical analysis. This study investigates the effect of evolutions and interactions of ICMEs on FDs profiles in the inner Solar System, using multipoint comparisons. We focus on multipoint ICME observations by Solar Orbiter, BepiColombo, and near-Earth spacecraft from March 10-16, 2022, when these spacecraft were ideally located for studying the radial and longitudinal evolutions of ICME and accompanying FDs. We compared GCR variations with the multiple in-situ data and ICME model, clarifying the correspondence between the evolution of each ICME structure in radial and azimuthal directions and the depth and gradients of the FD. The radial comparison revealed decreases in FD intensities and gradients associated with the expansion of the ICME. The longitudinal difference found in FD intensity indicates longitudinal variations of the ICMEs shielding effect. These results suggest that accurate multi-point FD comparisons require determining the relationship between the observers position and the inner structure of the passing ICMEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12317" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fe XVIII-XXIV K beta Inner-shell Absorption Lines in the X-ray Spectra of Neutron Star and Black Hole Binaries with XRISM</a><span class="id">[2510.12317]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The advent of the X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer Resolve onboard the XRISM space telescope opened a new era for high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of astrophysical plasmas.

The widely used atomic databases contain information on the K alpha but not K beta lines of these ions. We conducted the atomic structure calculation using FAC to derive the Fe K alpha and K beta lines and verified the result against ground experiments and other calculations of the Fe K alpha lines. We then implemented the Fe K beta lines in a radiative transfer code (cloudy) and compared the synthesized and observed spectra with XRISM. A reasonably good agreement was obtained between the observation and the ab initio calculations.

At this time, the list of known magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars is extremely limited, with only a handful of well-studied examples. Aims. We seek to expand this list, by retrieving targets from a variety of sources and demonstrating that they present simultaneously a surface magnetic field signature and {\delta} Scuti pulsations. Methods. We obtained archival and new spectropolarimetric datasets for a variety of known {\delta} Scuti stars and analysed them using the Least Squares Deconvolution method to generate mean Stokes I and V profiles for each target, from which we can determine longitudinal magnetic field measurements. Additionally, we assessed photometric data from the TESS satellite to discern frequency peaks consistent with {\delta} Scuti pulsations in known magnetic stars, and to identify magnetic candidates via rotational modulation. Results. We present a compiled list of all the confirmed magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars discovered to date, containing 13 stars. The majority of this sample lies outside the usual {\delta} Scuti instability strip in the H-R diagram, though we do not observe any specific correlations between magnetic field strength and various stellar parameters. This indicates that strong global magnetic fields play a fundamental role in shaping interior structure and processes. Magnetic fields thus must be included in realistic stellar models in order to more accurately predict structure and evolution. Conclusions. This work constitutes the largest database to date of strongly magnetic {\delta} Scuti stars, one that will continue to grow over time with subsequent studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The rings of (2060) Chiron: Evidence of an evolving system</a><span class="id">[2510.12388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The centaur (2060) Chiron has long been a candidate for hosting material in orbit, based on occultation and photometric and spectroscopic data. Here, we present a multichord stellar occultation observed on 2023 September 10 UT that reveals new and complex structures surrounding Chiron. High-cadence light curves show multiple secondary events that are best explained (when compared with a multishell interpretation) with a system of three confined rings located at average radii of 273, 325, and 438 km, the outermost of which lies beyond Chiron's Roche limit. The rings appear coplanar, with a mean pole orientation of {\lambda} = 151° +/- 4° and \b{eta} = 20° +/- 6°. A broader, disklike structure extends from about 200 to 800 km, and a newly detected faint feature is observed at  1380 km. Chiron thus appears as the fourth small solar system body known for hosting a ring system. Comparisons with previous occultation events that have occurred since 1994 show that these features are not permanent. With these observations, we may witness for the first time the ongoing formation and evolution of a ring system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12410" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infrared spectral signatures of light r-process elements in kilonovae</a><span class="id">[2510.12410]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A central question regarding neutron star mergers is whether they are able to produce all the r-process elements, from first to third peak. The high abundances of first-peak elements (atomic number $Z \sim 31-40$) in the solar composition means they may dominate the ejecta mass in kilonovae. We here study theoretical infrared signatures of such light elements with spectral synthesis modelling. By combining state-of-the-art NLTE physics with new radiative and collisional data for these elements, we identify several promising diagnostic lines from Ge, As, Se, Br, Kr and Zr. The models give self-consistent line luminosities and indicate specific features that probe emission volumes at early phases ($\sim$10d), the product of ion mass and electron density in late phases ($\gtrsim$75d), and in some cases direct ionic masses at intermediate phases. Emission by [Se I] 5.03 \mum\ + [Se III] 4.55 \mum\ can produce satisfactory fits to the Spitzer photometry of AT2017gfo. However, the models show consistently that with a Kr/Te and Se/Te ratio following the solar r-process pattern, Kr + Se emission is dominant over Te for the blend at 2.1 \mum\ observed in both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi. The somewhat better line profile fit with [Te III] may suggest that both AT2017gfo and AT2023vfi had a strongly sub-solar production of the light r-process elements. An alternative scenario could be that Kr + Se in an asymmetric morphological distribution generates the feature. Further JWST spectral data, in particular covering the so far unobserved $&gt;5$ \mum\ region, holds promise to determine the light r-process production of kilonovae, and in particular whether the light elements are made in a slow disk wind or in a fast proto-NS outflow. We identify specific needs for further atomic data on recombination rates and collision strengths for $Z=31-40$ elements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12413" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lanthanide Impact on the Infra-Red Spectra of Nebular Phase Kilonovae</a><span class="id">[2510.12413]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nebular phase kilonovae (KNe) have significant infra-red (IR) emission thought to be mostly forbidden emission lines from rapid neutron capture (r-process) species in neutron star merger ejecta. Lanthanide elements in particular have complex atomic structures with many IR transitions. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) radiative transfer simulations, we explore the impact of lanthanides on the IR spectra of KNe in the nebular phase, exploring a parameter space of ejecta mass and lanthanide fraction. We find that lanthanide impact is greater at higher densities, corresponding to earlier epochs and greater ejecta masses. The wavelengths most affected are found to be $\lambda \lesssim 4~\mu$m, with the species Ce \textsc{iii} and Nd \textsc{ii} being the most important contributors to spectral formation. We also find significant emission from species proposed in observations, notably Te \textsc{iii} at 2.1 $\mu$m, and Se \textsc{iii} at 4.5 and 5.7 $\mu$m, while W \textsc{iii} is subdominant at 4.5 $\mu$m. The Te \textsc{iii} feature at 2.1 $\mu$m is always blended, particularly with Zr \textsc{ii}, Ce \textsc{iii}, and Nd \textsc{ii}. We do not reproduce the smooth blackbody-like continua observed in AT2023vfi. Based on our results, we argue that line opacity alone is likely insufficient to produce optically thick continua in the nebular phase, even in the case of lanthanide/actinide-rich ejecta, as our models are optically thin in the IR at these epochs. Given that lanthanide contributions are dominant below 4 $\mu$m, we suggest that NIR observations best probe these elements, while MIR spectroscopy with \textit{JWST} can reliably probe non-lanthanide emission even in relatively lanthanide-rich cases.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhanced Localization of Dark Lensed Gravitational Wave Events Enables Host Galaxy Identification and Precise Cosmological Inference</a><span class="id">[2510.12470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lensed gravitational wave (GW) events are expected to be powerful new probes of cosmology, contingent on redshift measurement by electromagnetic observations. Host galaxy identification is thus crucial but challenging due to poor localization by GW signal alone. In this paper, we show that the third-generation ground-based GW detectors will detect a population of lensed events with three or more detectable images (including the central one), each arriving at distinct times and Earth locations in the space, forming an effective network that reduces the typical localization area to $\sim0.01$ deg$^2$. For at least $90\%$ (or $50\%$) of these events, the localization improves by more than a factor of $10$ (or $30$) comparing with unlensed cases. Such precise localization and multiple-image detections enable robust host-galaxy identification and, through lens modelling, further yield sub-arcsecond position. As “dark lensed sirens&quot;, these events become powerful probes of cosmological parameters. Using simulated lensed compact-binary mergers, we show that two-year or longer observations with third-generation GW detectors can measure the Hubble constant to $\lesssim1$\% precision via “dark lensed sirens&quot; (even when relying solely on lensed stellar-mass binary black hole events), while simultaneously constraining other cosmological parameters. This approach will provide an independent, complementary avenue for measuring cosmological parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12471" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asteroseismic calibration of the Rossby number and its connection to the stellar dynamo and fundamental properties</a><span class="id">[2510.12471]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stellar Rossby number, a dimensionless parameter quantifying the influence of Coriolis forces on convective motions, plays a pivotal role in understanding magnetic stellar evolution.

Nevertheless, Quaoar's flattening of 0.16, slow 17.7hr rotation and Weywot's low mass are difficult to reconcile with conventional tidal-evolution theory. We assess whether standard tides can reproduce the present-day architecture of the Quaoar-Weywot system and identify the initial conditions required. Orbit-averaged integrations spanning 4.5Gyr were carried out with two formalisms: (i) a constant phase-lag (CPL) and (ii) an Andrade creep-tide (ACT) framework. With the nominal Weywot mass, both tidal prescriptions converge on Weywot's observed orbital distance for a wide range of initial orbital distances and eccentricities; eccentricity is damped and present-day tidal torques are negligible, rendering the orbit quasi-stationary. Quaoar's spin, however, remains essentially unchanged from its inferred primordial period based on its present-day flattening, and does not reproduce the observed value. A match is possible only if Weywot is 5-10x more massive than current estimates and if its initial eccentricity is finely tuned; such scenarios are inconsistent with occultation-derived masses and imply an implausibly dense satellite. Based on the best fitting viscoelastic parameters, the most plausible composition for Quaoar is found to be a partially differentiated dwarf planet containing roughly equal masses of silicate rock and H2O-dominated warm (150-180K) ices. Standard tidal models reproduce Weywot's semimajor axis but cannot account for Quaoar's slow 17.7hr rotation without invoking an unrealistically massive satellite or external torques, suggesting that non-tidal processes - such as a largely primordial spin, early satellite loss, or a retrograde secondary giant impact - must have influenced Quaoar's rotational evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization from Rapidly Rotating Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.12500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara &amp; Rieutard (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of  1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DIPLODOCUS II: Implementation of transport equations and test cases relevant to micro-scale physics of jetted astrophysical sources</a><span class="id">[2510.12505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>DIPLODOCUS (Distribution-In-PLateaux methODOlogy for the CompUtation of transport equationS) is a novel framework being developed for the general transport of particle distribution functions through the seven dimensions of phase space, including forcing terms and interactions between particles.

We analysed seven years of timing data from the Arecibo 305-m radio telescope, the Green Bank Telescope (GBT), and the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The data processing accounted for dispersion measure variations and relativistic spin precession-induced profile evolution. We employed both DDFWHE and DDGR binary models to measure the spin parameters, kinematic parameters and orbital parameters. The timing campaign has resulted in the precise measurement of five post-Keplerian parameters, which yield very precise masses for the system and three tests of general relativity. One of these is the second most precise test of the radiative properties of gravity to date: the intrinsic orbital decay, $\dot{P}_{\rm b,int}=-1.8288(16)\times10^{-12}\rm\,s\,s^{-1}$, represents $1.00005(91)$ of the GR prediction, indicating that the theory has passed this stringent test. The other two tests, of the Shapiro delay parameters, have precisions of 6\% and 5\% respectively; this is caused by the moderate orbital inclination of the system, $\sim 74^{\circ}$; the measurements of the Shapiro delay parameters also agree with the GR predictions. Additionally, we analysed the higher-order contributions of $\dot{\omega}$, including the Lense-Thirring contribution. Both the second post-Newtonian and the Lense-Thirring contributions are larger than the current uncertainty of $\dot{\omega}$ ($\delta\dot{\omega}=4\times10^{-4}\,\rm deg\,yr^{-1}$), leading to the higher-order correction for the total mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12510" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma-rays from Wolf-Rayet stellar winds</a><span class="id">[2510.12510]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray observations of young star clusters have recently provided evidence for particle acceleration occurring at stellar wind termination shocks, fueled by the mechanical energy of stellar winds from massive stars.

This scenario is particularly relevant given that a significant fraction of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are not found within clusters. To investigate this, we compiled a large sample of WR stars and ranked them based on their wind luminosity divided by the square of their distance, a proxy for their potential gamma-ray flux. We then searched for spatial coincidences between the most promising candidates and cataloged gamma-ray sources. This analysis leads us to propose associations between the stars WR14, WR110, WR111, and WR114 and several unidentified gamma-ray sources. These results suggest that WR stellar winds could represent a distinct and previously unrecognized population of gamma-ray emitters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 50-min coronal kink oscillation and its possible photospheric counterpart</a><span class="id">[2510.12527]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A coronal loop of 290 Mm length, observed at 171 Å with SDO/AIA on February 6th 2024 near AR 13571, is found to oscillate with two significantly different oscillation periods, $48.8 \pm 6.1$ min and $4.8\pm 0.3$ min. The oscillations occur in the time intervals without detected flares or eruptions. Simultaneously, near the Northern footpoint of the oscillating loop, we detect a $49.6 \pm 5.0$-min periodic variation of the average projected photospheric magnetic field observed with SDO/HMI. The shorter-period decayless oscillation is attributed to the eigen-mode, standing kink oscillation of the loop, while the longer-period oscillation may be the oscillatory motion caused by the periodic footpoint driver. The photospheric long-period process can also drive the short-period, eigen oscillation of the loop via the self-oscillatory, \lq\lq violin\rq\rq mechanism, in which a transverse oscillation is excited by an external quasi-steady flow.

However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\alpha$ parameter is $3\times10^{-4}\leq\alpha_{\nu}\leq2\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\times10^{-3}\leq\alpha_{\rm DW}\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem).

In this work we implement a specific realisation of these scenarios into an $N$-body code to explore the non-linear regime. We include two populations of particles to describe the interacting dark matter and the non-interacting baryons respectively. On linear scales we recover the suppression of structures obtained from Boltzmann codes, while non-linear scales exhibit an enhancement of the matter power. We find that fewer massive halos are formed at low redshift as a consequence of the elastic interaction and that dark matter halos are more compact than in the standard model. Furthermore, the ratio of dark matter and baryons density profiles is not constant. Finally, we corroborate that baryons efficiently cluster around dark matter halos so they provide good tracers of the dark matter velocity field despite the presence of the interaction. This shows that the interaction is not sufficiently strong as to disrupt virialised structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling gamma-ray signatures of particle acceleration in stellar clusters from GeV to PeV</a><span class="id">[2510.12562]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young massive stellar clusters (YMSCs) have recently regained interest as PeVatron candidates, potentially accounting for the cosmic-ray (CR) knee as alternatives to isolated supernova remnants (SNRs). LHAASO's unique capability to detect photons above 0.1 PeV, hence tracing multi-PeV CRs, can provide critical constraints on galactic acceleration models when combined with H.E.S.S. and Fermi-LAT data. We investigate the transport of particles from YMSCs acceleration sites, namely wind termination shocks (WTS) or embedded SNRs, to nearby dense molecular clouds where proton-proton interactions produce high-energy gamma rays. We determine the necessary conditions, such as the distance between the acceleration site and the target, or the cluster's power and age, for detectable gamma-ray excesses and identify viable systems through parameter space exploration. By comparing with observations, we can constrain key physical parameters including WTS efficiency, diffusion coefficient and injection slope. Our analysis also examines whether some of LHAASO's unidentified sources might correspond to such cluster-cloud systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The MIRI Excesses around Degenerates (MEAD) Survey I: A candidate cold brown dwarf in orbit around the nearby white dwarf 2MASS J09424023-4637176</a><span class="id">[2510.12601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The MIRI Excesses Around Degenerates Survey is a Cycle 2 James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Survey program designed to image nearby white dwarfs in the mid-IR with the MIRI imaging mode. Only a handful of white dwarfs have previously been observed beyond 8 \micron. This survey gathered observations for 56 white dwarfs within 25 pc at 10 and 15 \micron, probing each white dwarf for unresolved IR excesses, IR flux deficits indicative of collision induced absorption, or resolved substellar companions. We present in this paper observations of our first target, 2MASS J09424023-4637176, (also UCAC4 217-039132), henceforth called MEAD 62. It is a magnetic DA white dwarf with an estimated age of $7.6^{+1.7}_{-2.2}$ Gyr. A red candidate companion, MEAD 62B, about 2 magnitudes fainter at 15 $\mu$m than the white dwarf is detected at an apparent separation of 1.95&quot;. If confirmed, MEAD 62B, would be a $0.014^{+0.002}_{-0.003}$ \Msun brown dwarf with T$_{\rm eff} = 343^{+7}_{-11}$ K, according to ATMO2020 evolutionary models. Although its red F1000W$-$F1500W color is similar to background galaxies, MEAD 62B, is consistent with being an unresolved point-source from empirical PSF fitting. A false positive analysis yields an expectation number of 0.66 red (F1000W$-$F1500$ \geq +0.80$ mag) unresolved sources within the same separation (r$\leq2$ arcsec) for the entire MEAD survey. Thus, this candidate companion as likely to be an actual companion as a false-positive unresolved background galaxy. Additional observations to measure common proper motion or sample the SED are warranted to confirm the nature of MEAD 62B. A deep near-infrared imaging detection is achievable from the ground while JWST is needed at longer infrared wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alleviating the $H_0$ tension through new interacting dark energy model in light of DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2510.12627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GEFF: The Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - A tool for inflationary gauge-field production</a><span class="id">[2510.12644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The GEFF - the Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - is a new Python package designed to study gauge-field production during inflation. The package provides a framework to implement and use the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a numerical technique devised to study the nonlinear dynamics associated with inflationary gauge-field generation. The GEF has already been applied in the context of axion inflation, and with the GEFF package, one can build on these results. The GEFF gives users access to ready-to-use model files for two scenarios of axion inflation: pure axion inflation, with the inflaton coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, and fermionic axion inflation, which assumes that the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge field is coupled to the inflaton, resulting in the production SM fermions via the Schwinger effect. The GEFF provides the user with methods to solve GEF equations, including an integrated error estimator and self-correction algorithm. Furthermore, users can implement their own GEF models, e.g., variations of axion inflation or related scenarios. The package also comes with tools to study the production of primordial gravitational waves induced by gauge fields. This is a starting guide for the GEFF, providing a high-level introduction to the GEF, installation instructions, and the basics for using this package.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Influence of the Accretion Disc Structure on X-ray Spectral States in Symbiotic Binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.12654]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Symbiotic stars are binary systems where a white dwarf (WD) accretes material from the wind of an evolved, late-type companion. X-ray-emitting symbiotic systems are classified into $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, and $\beta/\delta$ types, attributed to distinct physical mechanisms such as thermonuclear burning, wind interactions, and accretion-driven boundary layers. We present synthetic X-ray spectra derived from hydrodynamics simulations using the PHANTOM code, coupled with radiative-transfer calculations from SKIRT. We reproduce all X-ray spectral types by exploring different density structure of the accretion disc, the viewing angle, the plasma temperature of the boundary layer, and/or the presence of extended emission. The synthetic X-ray spectra consist of both absorbed and reflected components. In systems with massive, high-column density discs and viewing angles close to edge-on, the reflected continuum can dominate the X-ray emission. This effect is less pronounced in systems with low-mass, lower-column density discs. We explore i) systems going from $\delta$ to $\beta$ states, ii) $\delta$-types that become $\beta/\delta$ sources, iii) the variability of the three Fe emission lines in the 6.0-7.0 energy range, and iv) the possible physical processes behind the $\alpha$ sources. The observations from iconic symbiotic systems are discussed in line of the present models. Our framework offers predictive power for future X-ray monitoring and provides a path toward connecting accretion disc physics with observed spectral states in symbiotic binaries with accreting WDs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enigmatic centi-SFU and mSFU nonthermal radio transients detected in the middle corona</a><span class="id">[2510.12658]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Decades of solar coronal observations have provided substantial evidence for accelerated particles in the corona. In most cases, the location of particle acceleration can be roughly identified by combining high spatial and temporal resolution data from multiple instruments across a broad frequency range. In almost all cases, these nonthermal particles are associated with quiescent active regions, flares, and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Only recently, some evidence of the existence of nonthermal electrons at locations outside these well-accepted regions has been found. Here, we report for the first time multiple cases of transient nonthermal emissions, in the heliocentric range of $\sim 3-7R_\odot$, which do not have any obvious counterparts in other wavebands, like white-light and extreme ultra-violet. These detections were made possible by the regular availability of high dynamic range low-frequency radio images from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory's Long Wavelength Array. While earlier detections of nonthermal emissions at these high heliocentric distances often had comparable extensions in the plane-of-sky, they were primarily been associated with radio CMEs, unlike the cases reported here. Thus, these results add on to the evidence that the middle corona is extremely dynamic and contains a population of nonthermal electrons, which is only becoming visible with high dynamic range low-frequency radio images.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tycho supernova exploded inside a planetary nebula (SNIP)</a><span class="id">[2510.12674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I examine recent observations of the type Ia supernova remnant (SNR Ia) Tycho and conclude that Tycho is an SN Ia inside a planetary nebula (SNIP). The observations reveal two opposite protrusions, termed ears, projected on the main shell of Tycho. The pair of ear structures resembles that of the SNRs Ia Kepler, SNR G299-2.9, and SNR G1.9+0.3, which earlier studies considered as SNIPs. The requirement that the explosion occurs within hundreds of thousands of years after the formation of the planetary nebula (by the second star to evolve) makes the core-degenerate scenario the most likely for Tycho. Several other possible scenarios lead to an SNIP, but they are unlikely for Tycho. The identification of Tycho as an SNIP leads to two general conclusions. (1) The fraction of SNIPs among normal SNe Ia is very large,  70-90%. Namely, the vast majority of normal SNe Ia are SNIPs. (2) To accommodate the large fraction of SNIPs, the delay time distribution of normal SNe Ia includes not only the stellar evolution timescale (as usually assumed), but also includes pockets of younger stellar populations in galaxies without ongoing star formation; the SNIPs come from the younger stellar populations in galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The diverse shapes of binary asteroid satellites born from sub-escape-velocity moonlet mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.12694]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent direct observations of atypically shaped rubble-pile satellites of sub-km asteroids in form of the spherically oblate Dimorphos and bilobate Selam challenge classical binary asteroid formation theories, which only explain the predominantly elongated population. This study further explores a rubble-pile satellite formation scenario for binary asteroid systems involving debris disks by investigating how mergers between moonlets with impact velocities below the mutual escape speed (sub-escape-velocity mergers) and tidal disruptions can create atypically shaped moons. We simulated sub-escape-velocity mergers between moonlets and studied the resulting structural evolution of the formed moon in a tidal environment using the polyhedral discrete elements method N-body code GRAINS. Firstly, we find that the shapes of rubble-pile moons formed by mergers in this regime are highly dependent on the shape and initial orientation of the involved moonlets. This can be explained by the moonlets largely retaining their individual structures during the impact. Secondly, we observe that mass-loss via tidal disruption for a bilobate object occurs in discrete regimes of distance to the primary. Closer to the primary, the innermost lobe is completely stripped off, while only a small piece of it is lost further out. Due to moonlets largely retaining their shape after undergoing a sub-escape-velocity merger, it is necessary to account for their non-sphericity to accurately model satellite formation in circumasteroidal debris disks. Moreover, the reshaping of merged objects via tidal disruption and distortion can produce oblate spheroid moons such as Dimorphos and highly elongated bilobate satellites with distinct necks such as Selam.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hierarchical summaries for primordial non-Gaussianities</a><span class="id">[2510.12715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The advent of Stage IV galaxy redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid marks the beginning of an era of precision cosmology, with one key objective being the detection of primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG), potential signatures of inflationary physics. In particular, constraining the amplitude of local-type PNG, parameterised by $f_{\rm NL}$, with $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 1$, would provide a critical test of single versus multi-field inflation scenarios. While current large-scale structure and cosmic microwave background analyses have achieved $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \sim 5$-$9$, further improvements demand novel data compression strategies. We propose a hybrid estimator that hierarchically combines standard $2$-point and $3$-point statistics with a field-level neural summary, motivated by recent theoretical work that shows that such a combination is nearly optimal, disentangling primordial from late-time non-Gaussianity. We employ PatchNet, a convolutional neural network that extracts small-scale information from sub-volumes (patches) of the halo number density field while large-scale information is retained via the power spectrum and bispectrum. Using Quijote-PNG simulations, we evaluate the Fisher information of this combined estimator across various redshifts, halo mass cuts, and scale cuts. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of patch-based field-level compression always enhances constraints on $f_{\rm NL}$, reaching gains of $30$-$45\%$ at low $k_{\rm max}$ ($\sim 0.1 \, h \, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$), and capturing information beyond the bispectrum. This approach offers a computationally efficient and scalable pathway to tighten the PNG constraints from forthcoming survey data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12783" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Ultra-Short Period Super-Earth and Sub-Neptune Spanning the Radius Valley Orbiting the Kinematic Thick Disk Star TOI-2345</a><span class="id">[2510.12783]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A crucial chemical link between stars and their orbiting exoplanets is thought to exist.

TOI-2345 b is a super-Earth with a period of 1.05 days and TOI-2345 c is a sub-Neptune with a period of 21 days.

Previous estimates of water content in M-dwarf systems have largely relied on population synthesis or atmosphere-interior evolution models, often treating impacts and atmospheric loss in isolation. In this work, we couple impact delivery, impact erosion, and mantle-atmosphere exchange within a model that tracks volatile evolution through stochastic collision histories. By explicitly including both planetesimal accretion and the prolonged luminous pre-main-sequence phase of M dwarfs, we find lower water inventories for the inner TRAPPIST-1 analogs (b-e), spanning only $10^{-4}$-$10^{-2} M_{\oplus,\rm ocn}$ across a wide range of disk structures and impact scenarios. By contrast, the outer planets (f-h analogs) frequently retain water inventories exceeding an Earth ocean mass. This systematic volatile gradient provides a physically motivated explanation for JWST's nondetections of atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 b and c, implying an origin rooted in formation conditions rather than in post-formation escape. Our results suggest that many rocky planets in compact M-dwarf systems may form already depleted in volatile compounds, fundamentally limiting their capacity to sustain atmospheres or surface oceans. More broadly, our multistage framework for volatile tracking can help interpret future observations of compact systems and set more realistic initial conditions for exoplanet interior compositions and atmospheric models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.09742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects includes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the so-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify–for the first time–the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be  15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to  50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can–in some cases–result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Hole Ringdown Amplitudescopy</a><span class="id">[2510.11782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields –such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom– that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts.

In this work we expand on these proposals to analyze the bandwidth and scan rate performance of entangled qubit protocols across different error regimes. We find that the phase-based readout of entangled protocols preserves the search bandwidth independent of qubit number, in contrast to power-based detection schemes, thereby achieving a genuine scan-rate advantage. We derive coherence time and error rate requirements for qubit systems to realize this advantage. Applying our analysis to dark photon searches, we find that entangled states of approximately 100 qubits can become competitive with benchmark photon-counting cavity experiments for masses $\gtrsim 30{-}40~\mu{\rm eV}$, provided sufficiently low error rates are achieved.

While these fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small scales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave background observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the inflationary Hubble scale, $m\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is flat. Meanwhile, if $m\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but avoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a coincidence of scales $m\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we show that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary dynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted spectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically, if its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition $V''&lt;3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the boundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to $H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of $e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived, this mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which is insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar field with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to constitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses. We compute the relationship between the mass and self-coupling of quartic dark matter predicted by this mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11879" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Tests of Low-Scale Quantum Gravity with Cosmic-Ray Collisions</a><span class="id">[2510.11879]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic ray collisions at high center of mass energy could enable graviton and black hole production as expected in theories of low-scale quantum gravity, such as extra-dimensions, many species, or some versions of string theory. Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M_f \gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M_f \gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M_f \gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11913" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Signatures from Lepton Number Breaking Phase Transitions with Flat Potentials</a><span class="id">[2510.11913]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extensions of the Standard Model typically contain “flaton fields&quot; defined as fields with large vacuum expectation values and almost flat potentials where scalar self-coupling is small or vanishes at tree level. Such potentials have been used to drive a secondary inflationary epoch after a primary phase of inflation, in what are called thermal inflation models. Although the primordial, high-scale inflationary epoch can solve the horizon and flatness problems, it does not always resolve difficulties associated with late-time relics produced in extensions of the Standard Model. These relics typically decay too late, injecting entropy and energetic particles that spoil successful predictions like Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. It is here that thermal inflation plays a crucial role: diluting unwanted relics by many orders of magnitude without erasing the baryon asymmetry or the large-scale structure set up by the earlier phase of inflation. The preferred scale for this phenomenon is in the range $10^6-10^8$ GeV if one considers supergravity, but without it, any scale above the EW scale is valid. We investigate a typical form of these potentials and determine what are the conditions for the potentials to develop a barrier such that when the flatons settle to the true minimum, the associated Gravitational Waves can be observed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12020" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phase space analysis of an exponential model in $f(Q)$ gravity including linear dark-sector interactions</a><span class="id">[2510.12020]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism.

Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points. We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter attractor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Model of deep zonal flows in giant planets</a><span class="id">[2510.12236]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A mechanism by which the surface zonal flows of giant planets can be gradually attenuated with depth is explored. The zonal flow is driven by an imposed forcing in a thin layer near the surface. A meridional circulation is set up, analogous to the Ferrel-like cells observed in Jupiter's atmosphere. Acting on a stably stratified thin surface layer, the meridional flow induces a horizontal temperature anomaly which leads to a gradual reduction of the zonal winds with depth, governed by the thermal wind equation. Our model is a Boussinesq plane layer, with gravity acting parallel to the rotation axis. A suite of fully three-dimensional time-dependent numerical simulations has been performed to investigate the model behaviour. Below the forced stable layer, convection is occurring, typically in the form of tall thin cells. The fluctuating components of the three-dimensional flow can be driven by either the convection or the Reynolds stresses associated with the jet shear flow. When fluctuations are mainly driven by convection in the form of tall thin columns and the forcing is relatively weak, the horizontal temperature anomaly persists much deeper into the interior than when it is driven by shear flow. The zonal jets can therefore extend deep into the interior, consistent with the Juno gravity data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.12257]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12352" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The probe limit in MHD and its implications for magnetic transport</a><span class="id">[2510.12352]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many phenomenological and effective field-theoretical (EFT) applications of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) in the presence of a background magnetic field employ a simplifying assumption whereby the electromagnetic and the energy-momentum fluctuations decouple.

In this paper, we investigate the details and the consistency of this so-called $\textit{probe limit}$ in different parametric regimes of MHD plasmas. In the first part of the paper, our discussion explores the hydrodynamic (higher-form) theory of MHD. In the second part, we then explicitly test the probe limit by using a microscopic holographic (AdS/CFT) model of a strongly coupled plasma. In the process, we develop the holographic Schwinger-Keldysh EFT prescription for describing the bulk 2-form fields and their dual 1-form symmetries. Moreover, we find evidence of a phase transition at low temperatures and show that magnetic Hall transport can emerge as a consequence of background charge density that breaks the charge conjugation symmetry of the state. Finally, we discuss the implications for magnetic transport, with a particular view towards the dynamics of dense nuclear matter in neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12472" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Constraints on Chaplygin Gas Models in Non-Minimally Coupled Power Law $f(Q)$ Gravity with Quasars</a><span class="id">[2510.12472]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where gravity emerges from non-metricity $Q$, we explore the cosmological implications of its non-minimal coupling to matter.

We constrain these models with three recent observational datasets: Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) data. For the QSO dataset, we propose an analytical expression for errors in comoving distance to circumvent the reliance on Monte Carlo simulations. Using kinematic diagnostics such as the deceleration and jerk parameters and Om diagnostic, we assess deviations of the proposed models from $\Lambda$CDM. Our joint analysis of the three datasets reveals that the transition redshift from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of the universe for the GCG, MCG and VCG models is $0.620^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, $0.537^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ and $0.470^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ respectively, indicating a departure from $\Lambda$CDM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts, but no neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2510.12634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Cannon-Ball model of Gamma-Ray Bursts and their afterglows–described in the text and in innumerable previous occasions–is extremely successful and predictive.

Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH contribution to the DM density by non-detection of their Hawking radiation's effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of DM as PBHs with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g, separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization sources on the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1\% of the total DM. We find that these constraints are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14990" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconstruction of the swampland conjectures with DESI DR1 BAO data</a><span class="id">[2409.14990]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The swampland conjectures (SCs) propose constraints on effective field theories that can arise from a consistent theory of quantum gravity.

Our results indicate that the reconstructed second SC is several sigmas away from zero, suggesting a steep potential, in contrast to recent model-specific analyses assuming exponential potentials. The novelty of our approach lies in using solely model-independent reconstructions of cosmological observables from DESI, such as the angular diameter distance and the Hubble expansion history.

The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18694" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-long MeV transient from a relativistic jet: a tidal disruption event candidate</a><span class="id">[2507.18694]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On July 2, 2025, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard the Fermi Gamma-ray space telescope detected three short-duration MeV transients with overlapping sky locations. These events, named as GRB 250702D, B, and E (collectively referred to as DBE), triggered the detector with delays of approximately 1-2 hours between each burst. Follow-up observations of this unusually long MeV transient (lasting &gt;3 hours) by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array over a period of 10 days revealed a steep temporal decline in soft X-rays ($\propto t^{-1.9 \pm 0.1}$). The time-averaged spectra during the outbursts are well described by a single power law $dN_{\gamma}/dE \propto E^{-1.5}$, while upper limits above 100 MeV imply a spectral cutoff between 10 MeV and 100 MeV. Using standard gamma-ray transparency arguments, we derive a lower limit on the bulk Lorentz factor. Combined with the steep decline in X-rays, these constraints point to a relativistic jet origin. The properties of DBE are inconsistent with established GRB spectral-energy correlations, disfavoring classical long GRB progenitors. Instead, the basic characteristics of DBE resemble those of previously reported jetted tidal disruption events (TDEs), though alternative progenitor channels cannot be excluded. In the relativistic TDE scenario, DBE is the first one with detected MeV gamma-ray emission. We argue that the observed emission is most likely produced by synchrotron radiation from sub-TeV electrons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries</a><span class="id">[2507.21821]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Short–period ($P&lt;$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($&gt;$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the equilibrium tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, so-called Type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-Situ Formation of the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt</a><span class="id">[2508.04776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cold Classical Kuiper belt objects (CCKBOs) are considered first-generation planetesimals that formed 42-47 au from the Sun and remained untouched since.

Previous calculations along these lines are inconsistent with the CCKB's supposedly pristine nature, because they assume orders of magnitude more solid mass than is actually present in the CCKB (a few thousandths of an Earth mass) and do not explain how to expel the &gt;99% extra mass. Here we show from 3D numerical simulations of dust and gas that the total mass in CCKBOs, their characteristic sizes of  100 km, and the relative proportion of prograde to retrograde binaries can all be reproduced at the tail end of the solar nebula's life, when it contained just 2-5% of its original (minimum-mass) gas. As a solar metallicity's worth of mm-sized solids drains out from 42-47 au from nebular headwinds, about 1% of the dust collapses into planetesimals that remain behind in the CCKB region. Binarity is guaranteed from a simple analytic estimate, confirmed numerically, of the spin angular momentum in clumps seeded by the streaming instability. We show that other formation scenarios, including trapping of dust within a gas pressure bump, fail to reproduce the low-mass CCKB.

The \textit{Einstein Probe} has detected a significant number of fast X-ray transients that display no gamma-ray emission, complicating their robust association to more common gamma-ray bursts. To explore their possible connection, we analyzed the redshift distribution of both \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients and long duration gamma-ray bursts. A comparative analysis of their cumulative redshift distributions using non-parametric two-sample tests, namely the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling tests, finds no statistically significant difference. These tests favor that their redshifts are drawn from the same underlying distribution. This empirical connection between \textit{Einstein Probe} transients and long gamma-ray bursts is further supported by their agreement with the so-called “Amati relation” between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic-equivalent energy. Together, these results indicate that most extragalactic \textit{Einstein Probe} fast X-ray transients are closely related to long gamma-ray bursts and originate from a massive star (collapsar) progenitor channel.

We perform a suite of atmospheric retrievals on both datasets, including free-chemistry, non-equilibrium, and aerosol models, using laboratory-derived complex refractive indices for a variety of photochemical haze analogues. Free retrievals systematically return lower metallicities than inferred by self-consistent chemical disequilibrium models, and the inclusion of absorbing aerosols, especially CH4-dominated, nitrogen-poor tholins, can further reduce the inferred metallicity by over an order of magnitude. These hazes reproduce the observed NIRISS slope through scattering and match MIRI features via C-H bending absorption near 7 um, while yielding particle properties consistent with photochemical production in H2-rich atmospheres. Although their inclusion improves the joint fit and reduces tension between datasets, it also significantly lowers the retrieved CH4 abundance, highlighting degeneracies between metallicity, composition, and aerosol properties.

This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09760" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Spectroscopy of SN Ia 2022aaiq and 2024gy: Evidence for Enhanced Central Stable Ni Abundance and a Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition</a><span class="id">[2510.09760]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical + near-infrared (NIR) + mid-infrared (MIR) observations of the normal Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) 2022aaiq and 2024gy in the nebular phase, continuously spanning 0.35-28 microns.

Therefore, these astrophysical objects are promising candidates for studying high-energy electron–positron interactions, such as the production of $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons. In this work, we explore the implications of electron–positron annihilation processes in the jet environments of FSRQs, focusing on the resonant production of electroweak bosons and their potential contribution to the diffuse neutrino flux. By modeling the electron distribution in the jet of the FSRQ 3C 279 during a flaring state, we calculate the reaction rates for $W^{\pm}$ and $Z$ bosons and estimate the resulting diffuse fluxes from the cosmological population of FSRQs. We incorporate the FSRQ luminosity function and its redshift evolution to account for the population distribution across cosmic time, finding that the differential flux contribution exhibits a pronounced peak at redshift $z \sim 1$. While the expected fluxes remain well below the detection thresholds of current neutrino observatories such as IceCube, KM3NeT, or Baikal-GVD, the expected flux from the $Z$ boson production could account for approximately $10^{-3}$ of the total diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux. These results provide a theoretical benchmark for the role of Standard Model electroweak processes in extreme astrophysical environments and emphasize the interplay between particle physics and astrophysics, illustrating that even rare high-energy interactions can leave a subtle but quantifiable imprint on the diffuse astrophysical neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Emergent Cosmological Expansion in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</a><span class="id">[2406.01397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider the emergence of large-scale cosmological expansion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity.

In this work, we demonstrate that this assumption holds only for larger mixing angles with a dependency on the mass of the dark matter.

We present a systematic study of the parameter space of the singlet-doublet dark matter relic, incorporating annihilation, co-annihilation, and, for the first time, co-scattering processes. Additionally, non-thermal productions via the freeze-in and SuperWIMP mechanism are also explored. We found that due to the inclusion of co-scattering processes, the correct relic density parameter space is shifted towards the detection sensitivity range of the LHC and MATHUSLA via displaced vertex signatures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Verifiable type-III seesaw and dark matter in a gauged $\boldsymbol{U(1)_{\rm B-L}}$ symmetric model</a><span class="id">[2504.00109]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a new extension of the Standard Model that incorporates a gauged \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) symmetry and the type-III seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino mass generation and provide a viable dark matter (DM) candidate. Unlike the type-I seesaw, the type-III seesaw extension under \( U(1)_{\rm B-L} \) is not automatically anomaly-free. We show that these anomalies can be canceled by introducing additional chiral fermions, which naturally emerge as DM candidates in the model. We thoroughly analyze the DM phenomenology, including relic density, direct and indirect detection prospects, and constraints from current experimental data. Furthermore, we explore the collider signatures of the model, highlighting the enhanced production cross-section of the triplet fermions mediated by the \( \rm B-L \) gauge boson, as well as the potential disappearing track signatures. Additionally, we investigate the gravitational wave signals arising from the first-order phase transition during \( \rm B-L \) symmetry breaking, offering a complementary cosmological probe of the framework.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterized behaviors of black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical region</a><span class="id">[2504.04995]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The comprehension of universal thermodynamic behaviors in the supercritical region is crucial for examining the characteristics of black hole systems under high temperature and pressure. This study is devoted to the analysis of characteristic lines and crossover behaviors within the supercritical region. By making use of the free energy, we introduce three key thermodynamic quantities: scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Our results demonstrate that the Widom line, associated with the maximal scaled variance, can effectively differentiate between small and large black hole-like subphases, each displaying distinct thermodynamic behaviors within the supercritical region. Furthermore, by utilizing quasinormal modes, we identify the Frenkel line, offering a dynamic perspective to distinguish between small and large black hole-like subphases. These contribute to a deeper comprehension of black hole subphases in the supercritical region, thus illuminating new facets of black hole thermodynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12572" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accelerated inference of binary black-hole populations from the stochastic gravitational-wave background</a><span class="id">[2506.12572]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to observe $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ of overlapping signals per year from a multitude of astrophysical sources that will be computationally challenging to resolve individually. On the other hand, the stochastic background resulting from the entire population of sources encodes information about the underlying population, allowing for population parameter inference independent and complementary to that obtained with individually resolved events. Parameter estimation in this case is still computationally challenging, as computing the power spectrum involves sampling $\sim 10^5$ sources for each set of hyperparameters describing the binary population. In this work, we build on recently developed importance sampling techniques to compute the SGWB efficiently and train neural networks to interpolate the resulting background. We show that a multi-layer perceptron can encode the model information, allowing for significantly faster inference. We test the network assuming an observing setup with CE and ET sensitivities, where for the first time we include the intrinsic variance of the SGWB in the inference, as in this setup it presents a dominant source of measurement noise.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projective Transformations for Regularized Central-Force Dynamics: Hamiltonian Formulation</a><span class="id">[2506.22681]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work introduces a Hamiltonian approach to regularization and linearization of central force particle dynamics through a new canonical extension of the so-called &quot;projective decomposition&quot;. The regularization scheme is formulated within the framework of classic analytical Hamiltonian dynamics as a redundant-dimensional canonical/symplectic coordinate transformation, combined with an evolution parameter transformation, on extended phase space. By considering a generalized version of the standard projective decomposition, we obtain a family of such canonical transformations which differ at the momentum level. From this family of transformations, a preferred coordinate set is chosen that possesses a simple and intuitive connection to the particle's local reference frame. Using this transformation, closed-form solutions are readily obtained for inverse-square and inverse-cubic radial forces, or any superposition thereof. Governing equations are numerically validated for the classic two-body problem incorporating the J2 gravitational perturbation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Progenitors, Large Couplings: Type Ic Supernova Constraints on Radiatively Decaying Particles</a><span class="id">[2509.18253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supernova (SN) 1987A is a celebrated laboratory in searches for gamma-ray flashes produced by the radiative decay of sub-GeV particles such as axion-like particles (ALPs), sterile neutrinos, and novel gauge bosons. At large couplings, however, particles decay rapidly inside the stellar envelope, which results in a suppression of the signal. Focusing on the prototypical example of ALPs with a photon coupling, we show that core-collapse SNe of Type Ic are much less affected by this attenuation, thanks to the compactness of their progenitors ensuing from the loss of their envelope. While Fermi-LAT may miss the brief gamma-ray flash from a single Type Ic SN, their high rate allows for a statistical approach: by stacking many events, we can obtain constraints that significantly surpass those from SN 1987A at large couplings. Our approach can be extended to any feebly interacting particle featuring a decay channel into photons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20450" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Splitting the Gravitational Atom: Instabilities of Black Holes with Synchronized/Resonant Hair</a><span class="id">[2509.20450]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm, linking superradiance from ultralight fields – creating gravitational atoms – to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ”very hairy” regime, where a small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GW250114 reveals black hole horizon signatures</a><span class="id">[2510.01001]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The horizon of a black hole, the &quot;surface of no return,&quot; is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a &quot;direct wave&quot; component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.</p></div></details></article></body>
