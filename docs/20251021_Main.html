I. Scalable Tree-Based Models for Photometric Spectral Classification and New Discoveries from LSST Data Preview 1 and Euclid Quick Data Release 1</a><span class="id">[2510.16098]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the Ultracool dwarf Science with MachIne LEarning (USMILE), a program developing machine-learning tools for the discovery and characterization of ultracool dwarfs. We introduce USMILE Avocado, a spectral classification framework that uses broadband photometry from wide-field surveys – Rubin Observatory LSST Data Preview 1, VISTA Hemisphere Survey, and CatWISE – as input features. The framework has two gradient-boosted decision-tree models scalable to the massive data volumes of modern surveys: the classifier, which distinguishes ultracool dwarfs from stellar/extragalactic contaminants, and the regressor, which predicts spectral types. A key strength is its ability to natively handle missing photometric features, whereas earlier machine-learning approaches required complete multi-band detections or relied on imputation, thereby excluding genuine ultracool dwarfs or introducing bias. Trained on an augmented labeled dataset of &gt;2 million sources built from known ultracool dwarfs, reddened early-type stars, and quasars, the models achieve strong performance: the classifier attains an ROC AUC of 0.976 and an F1 score of 0.92, while the regressor yields a mean-squared error of 0.88 subtypes. Applying these models, we carried out the first ultracool dwarf search with LSST DP1, cross-matched against VHS and CatWISE. Crucially, Euclid Quick Data Release 1 provided near-IR spectra for hundreds of candidates, enabling a rare, large-scale external spectroscopic validation. This confirmed 15 M6–L2 discoveries, verified USMILE performance, and clarified regimes where USMILE predictions are most reliable. Building on these insights, we identified 25 additional M6–L9 photometric candidates. These demonstrate the effectiveness of machine-learning methods in the data-rich era of wide-field surveys, highlighting the synergy between LSST and Euclid in expanding the ultracool dwarf census.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Early X-ray emission of short Gamma-Ray Bursts: insights into physics and multi-messenger prospects</a><span class="id">[2510.16108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) traces the transition between the prompt emission and the afterglow radiation, and its rapid flux decline is often interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission. As such, it can offer insights into the emission mechanisms active during the prompt emission and the physics of GRB jets. In this work, we focus on merger-driven GRBs, which are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by ground-based interferometers, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We present a systematic analysis of the early X-ray emission ($t &lt; 10^3 \ \mathrm{s}$) of a sample of 16 merger-driven GRB candidates detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (hereafter, Swift). We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of soft and hard X-ray data (0.3-150 keV) by fitting two curved spectral models to the spectra: a physical synchrotron model and an empirical smoothly broken power law model. We characterized the evolution of the peak energy and bolometric flux, and derived the intrinsic properties of the 10 bursts with measured redshift. We discovered a tight correlation between the rest-frame peak energy of the spectra and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity. Specifically, we obtained $\nu_{c,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.64 \pm 0.03)}$ when adopting the synchrotron model, and $E_{p,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.58 \pm 0.04)}$ when adopting the smoothly broken power law. Both relations were extrapolated to the typical prompt emission energies and well describe the properties of short GRBs detected in the MeV gamma-rays. These results suggest a common origin for the prompt and steep-decay emissions in merger-driven GRBs, and rule out high-latitude emission as the dominant process shaping the early X-ray tails. Finally, we assessed the detectability of these sources with the Wide-field X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of Compton scattering in the jet of 3C 84</a><span class="id">[2510.16109]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>3C 84 is the brightest cluster galaxy in the Perseus Cluster. It is among the closest radio-loud active galaxies and among the very few that can be detected from low frequency radio up to TeV $\gamma$-rays. Here we report on the first X-ray polarization observation of 3C 84 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, for a total of 2.2 Msec that coincides with a flare in $\gamma$-rays. This is the longest observation for a radio-loud active galaxy that allowed us to reach unprecedented sensitivity, leading to the detection of an X-ray polarization degree of $\rm\Pi_X=4.2\pm1.3\%$ ($\sim3.2\sigma$ confidence) at an X-ray electric vector polarization angle of $\rm \psi_X=163^{\circ}\pm9^{\circ}$, that is aligned with the radio jet direction on the sky. Optical polarization observations show fast variability about the jet axis as well. Our results strongly favor models in which X-rays are produced by Compton scattering from relativistic electrons – specifically Synchrotron Self-Compton – that takes places downstream, away from the supermassive black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Chebyshev Approximation of Cosmic Expansion in $f(R)$ Gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.16120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a numerical framework to study the cosmological background evolution in $f(R)$ gravity by employing a \textit{spectral Chebyshev collocation approach}. Unlike standard integration methods such as Runge–Kutta that often encounter stiffness and accuracy issues, this formulation expands the normalized Hubble function $E(z) = H(z)/H_0$ as a finite Chebyshev series. The modified Friedmann equation is then enforced at selected Chebyshev–Gauss–Lobatto points, converting the original nonlinear differential equation into a system of algebraic relations for the series coefficients. This transformation yields exponentially convergent and numerically stable solutions over the entire redshift domain, $0&lt;z&lt;z_{max}$, eliminating the need for adaptive step-size control. We apply the method to two widely studied $f(R)$ models, Hu–Sawicki and Starobinsky, and perform a combined analysis using cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data and the Union 3.0 supernova compilation. The reconstructed expansion histories match observations to within $2\sigma$ over $0 &lt; z &lt; 2$, producing best-fit parameters of approximately $(\Omega_{m0}, H_0, \Lambda_{\mathrm{eff}}) \simeq (0.29, 68, 1.2\text{--}2.5\,H_0^2)$. These results indicates that both models reproduce the observed late-time acceleration while permitting small geometric corrections to $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, the spectral Chebyshev method provides a precise and computationally efficient framework for probing modified-gravity cosmologies in the precision-data era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRB 230307A Formed No Dust or Was Not a Binary Neutron Star Merger</a><span class="id">[2510.16121]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new analysis of the JWST infrared spectra of GRB 230307A (AT 2023vfi), a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with an infrared excess and spectral lines suggestive of significant heavy $r$-process production. The spectra, taken 29 and 61 days after the GRB trigger, have blackbody-like continua with $T_{\rm eff} \approx 550$ K and an emission line near $2.1$ $\mu$m, previously attributed to [Te III]. This line identification has been used as evidence for an $r$-process-powered kilonova (KN), despite no KN model producing a blackbody-like spectrum at late times. Such an infrared continuum could be emitted by newly formed dust, and we model the thermal emission to infer dust properties, including composition and mass. We find that the emission requires at least 3–$6 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of carbon or silicate dust, which is inconsistent with $r$-process yields expected from a neutron star merger. Alternatively, the continuum could be from $2\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ of metallic iron dust, which is mildly consistent (at 3$\sigma$) with KN models, but such dust is unlikely to form in the expanding ejecta. GRB 230307A's low late-time luminosity also constrains the amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni produced to $&lt;2.6 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ (3$\sigma$). No KN model can simultaneously form the necessary dust for the infrared continuum and heavy elements for the [Te III] line. We conclude that the blackbody continuum is not due to dust emission, or GRB 230307A did not originate from a binary compact-object merger.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tracking optical variability and outflows across the accretion states of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070</a><span class="id">[2510.16124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a study of the minute-timescale optical variability and spectroscopic outflow signatures in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst and re-brightenings. Minute-cadence, multi-filter optical light curves were obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network and the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE) over 2018-2020, complemented by X-ray data from Swift/BAT, XRT, and MAXI. We also acquired contemporaneous low-resolution optical spectra with the 2.1 m OAN San Pedro Martir and OAGH Cananea telescopes (Mexico) and the 1.5 m G.D. Cassini telescope at Loiano (Italy). The optical fractional rms peaks in the hard state and is dominated by short-timescale flickering that strengthens toward longer wavelengths, suggesting that the variability is jet-driven. In this scenario, inflow fluctuations inject velocity perturbations at the jet base (internal shock model). The variability is quenched in the soft state, with any residual signal likely linked to accretion-flow fluctuations. This behaviour supports the accretion-ejection coupling in black hole binaries and shows that the jet's variability signature extends to optical wavelengths in all hard states. In the faintest hard states, residual optical variability may instead trace cyclo-synchrotron emission from the hot flow. The spectra show double-peaked emission lines and tentative cold-wind signatures during the hard state. Such winds were reported during the main 2018 outburst; here we find evidence of their presence also in later re-brightenings. Their absence in the soft state likely reflects stronger disc ionisation from the higher X-ray flux, suppressing low-ionisation optical features.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16129" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutron Star-Main Sequence Collisions Robustly Form Dynamically Stable Thorne-Żytkow Objects</a><span class="id">[2510.16129]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Thorne-Żytkow Objects (TŻOs) are hypothetical hybrid stars with a neutron star at the core of a large, diffuse envelope.

Using a moving-mesh hydrodynamics solver integrated into the parallel-code Charm N-body GrAvity solver, we demonstrate that these “impact scenario” formation processes robustly form (TŻOs) for periastron distances less than one stellar radius. These (TŻOs) are dynamically stable and they can serve as initial models for further evolutionary studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updated Cosmological Constraints from 2D BAO Measurements: A New Compilation and Comparison with DESI DR2</a><span class="id">[2510.16141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate and update observational constraints on cosmological parameters within the $\Lambda$CDM and dynamical dark energy frameworks, using a new compilation of the transverse (or 2D) BAO data, measurements that provide a relatively model-independent estimate of the BAO angular scale at a given redshift. Firstly, we assess the consistency of this compilation with CMB-Planck data and recent BAO results from the DESI collaboration. After confirming minimal tension with CMB data, we perform a series of joint analyses combining CMB data with the 2D BAO compilation, as well as with several recent Type Ia supernova (SNIa) samples. In all cases, we compare the constraining power of the 2D BAO data with that of DESI DR2 samples. Our results indicate that combining 2D BAO with CMB and SNIa data provides observational constraints that are competitive with those obtained using DESI DR2. Although the precision of DESI DR2 results remains higher, as expected due to the more accurate 3D measurements, the 2D BAO compilation yields strong constraints. For example, in the $\Lambda$CDM context, we find $H_0 = 68.16^{+0.41}_{-0.37} \,\,\, \text{km s}^{-1}\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ (CMB + 2D BAO) and $\Sigma m_{\nu} &lt; 0.081~\mathrm{eV}$ (95\% CL). These results are comparable to analogous analyses using DESI DR2. Several other cases are analyzed and presented in the main text. Due to these results, we conclude that this new 2D BAO compilation is both robust and competitive in constraining cosmological parameters, and, importantly, it does not exhibit significant tension with CMB measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16164" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Searching for Exotrojans in Pulsar Binary Systems</a><span class="id">[2510.16164]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Trojan asteroids are found in the equilateral triangle Lagrange points of the Sun-Jupiter system in great number, though they also exist less prolifically in other Sun-planet systems. Despite up to planetary mass Trojans being predicted in extrasolar systems (i.e. exotrojans), they remain largely unconfirmed, though with recent strong candidate evidence emerging. We turn the current search for exotrojans to radio pulsars with low-mass companions ($\sim0.01\,\rm{M}_\odot$) using accurately measured pulse times of arrival. With techniques developed for detecting the reflex motion of a star due to a librating Trojan, we place reasonable mass constraints ($\sim 1\,\rm{M}_\oplus$) on potential exotrojans around binary pulsars observed in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We find weak evidence consistent with $\sim1\,\rm{M}_{\rm J}$ exotrojans in the PSR J0023+0923 and PSR J1705$-$1903 systems, though the signals likely have a different, unknown source. We also place a libration-independent upper mass constraint of $\sim8$ M$_{\rm J}$ on exotrojans in the PSR 1641+8049 binary system by looking for an inconsistency between the times of superior conjunction as measured by optical light curves and those predicted by radio timing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charged pion chain decay and the cosmic ray positron flux</a><span class="id">[2510.16170]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The study of the cosmic ray positron flux has attracted intense attention in recent years, especially because the observations suggest that it could receive contributions from sources such as pulsars or the self–annihilation or decay of dark matter particles. The main known source of relativistic positrons, that form the background to possible additional contributions, is the chain decay of $\pi^+$ produced in the inelastic interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar and circumstellar gas. The shape of the energy spectrum of positrons produced in these pion decays can be calculated exactly and is well known. However, surprisingly, some estimates of the contribution of the standard mechanism to the positron flux have adopted an incorrect spectral shape of the positron produced in these decays, following an error present in a 1997 paper of Moskalenko and Strong. In this work we report this error, discuss its origin, and estimate its impact on the numerical results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modelling the Future of Gaia Neutron Star-Main Sequence Binaries: From Eccentric Orbits to Millisecond Pulsar-White Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.16201]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We model the evolution of 21 Gaia neutron star (NS)-main-sequence binaries (orbital period $P_{\mathrm{orb}}\sim200$–$1000$ days, eccentricity $e\gtrsim0.2$) using binary evolution with \texttt{MESA}. We examine eccentric mass transfer and models assuming prior circularization. All systems end as NS-white dwarf (WD) binaries, but transfer modes yield distinct outcomes. Under eccentric transfer, binaries are driven to higher $e$, forming orbits with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and $P_{\rm orb}\sim1000$-$4000$ days. Periastron bursts are brief ($\lesssim10^6$ yr), transfer only a few $\times10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$, and produce mildly recycled pulsars ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\gtrsim50$ ms) with low-mass He WDs. Artificially circularized transfer gives $P_{\rm orb}\sim200$-$2000$ days, lasts $\sim10^7$ yr, and allows NSs to accrete $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$, forming fully recycled MSPs ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\sim$ few-30 ms) with CO WDs. Allowing super-Eddington accretion up to $100\times$ the canonical rate makes even eccentric systems efficient MSP producers, though torque coupling remains uncertain. Using an adaptive, field-dependent magnetic-field decay timescale, we find MSPs stay radio-active over Gyr spans. Gaia systems undergoing stable mass transfer remain wide and fail to match the Galactic MSP-WD population, where most, nearly circular systems have $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim100$ days. Binaries with different mass ratios and initial configurations – likely leading to unstable mass transfer – are needed to reproduce the observed MSP-WD distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16202" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One century data of τ CMa: a (2+1)+1 system with a short-period overcontact binary and an eccentric intermediate orbit with probably no apsidal motion</a><span class="id">[2510.16202]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>{\tau} Canis Majoris (CMa) is an intriguing system that has captured astronomers' attention for more than a century. The two main components Aa and Ab are two evolved O stars on a 350 years orbit. Aa is itself a SB1 with a 155-days period and a 0.3 eccentricity. Since Hipparcos, we know that a 1.28-days period eclipsing binary (EB) is hidden somewhere in Aa or Ab, but nowhere else. Our recent analysis finally disentangles the system. We calculated the visual Aa-Ab orbit from AstraLux imaging. We detected the SB2 nature of Aa based on STIS spectra, the companion of the O star (Aa1) being a B+B binary (Aa2 = Aa2a + Aa2b). Multiple lines of evidence point towards Aa2 being the EB: time delays in the eclipsing orbit detected by TESS, high mass for Aa2 from SB1 from constraints from the orbit of Aa1, and a lack of radial-velocity motion of Ab synchronised with the eclipsing orbit. This remains as a tentative conclusion pending further analysis. We detect secular changes in the SB1 orbit of Aa1 on a baseline longer than a century. At this stage, the effect is most likely caused by the change in velocity of the Aa center of mass due to the Aa-Ab visual orbit. Apsidal motion is most probably not the culprit.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapidly rotating hot nuclear and hypernuclear compact stars: integral parameters and universal relations</a><span class="id">[2510.16239]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties.

We compute and analyze mass–radius and moment–of–inertia–mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Production of radioactive $^{22}$Na in core-collapse supernovae: the Ne-E(L) component in presolar grains and its possible consequences on supernova observations</a><span class="id">[2510.16246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Presolar graphite grains carry the isotopic signatures of their parent stars. A significant fraction of presolar graphites shows isotopic abundance anomalies relative to solar for elements such as O, Si, Mg and Ca, which are compatible with nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Therefore, they must have condensed from CCSN ejecta before the formation of the Sun. Their most puzzling abundance signature is the $^{22}$Ne-enriched component Ne-E(L), interpreted as the effect of the radioactive decay of $^{22}$Na ($T_{1/2}$ = 2.6 years). Previous works have shown that if H is ingested into the He shell and not fully destroyed before the explosion, the CCSN shock in the He shell material produces large $^{22}$Na amounts. Here we focus on such CCSN models, showing a radioactive $^{26}$Al production compatible with grains measurements, and analyze the conditions of $^{22}$Na nucleosynthesis. In these models, $^{22}$Na is mostly made in the He shell, with a total ejected mass varying between 2.6$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 1.9$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that such $^{22}$Na may already impact the CCSN light curve 500 days after the explosion, and at later stages it can be the main source powering the CCSN light curve for up to a few years before the $^{44}$Ti decay becomes dominant. Based on the CCSN yields above, the 1274.53 keV $\gamma$-ray flux due to $^{22}$Na decay could be observable for years after the first CCSN light is detected, depending on the distance. This makes CCSNe possible sites to detect a $^{22}$Na $\gamma$-ray signature consistently with the Ne-E(L) component found in presolar graphites. Finally, we discuss the potential contribution from the $^{22}$Na decay to the galactic positron annihilation rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16249" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accretion and Jet Coupling in Powerful Radio Quasars at Cosmic Noon</a><span class="id">[2510.16249]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present bolometric corrections, as a function of wavelength, for powerful radio-loud quasars from the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Galaxies (3CRR) at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the intrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range 1{\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over inclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use accretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the unobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV gap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range ( 1-400) across different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of these intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is divided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly different values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher Eddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity and accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes roughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact jets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This suggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio luminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated bolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to powerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Unified Maxwell-Bloch Framework for Multi-periodic 6.7 GHz Methanol Flaring in G9.62+0.20E</a><span class="id">[2510.16265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze a decade of 6.7 GHz methanol monitoring data in G9.62+0.20E, confirming the known periodicities of p1 = 241.3 +/- 2.3 d and p2 = 52.5 +/- 0.3 d, and identifying three new cycles at p3 = 127.0 +/- 1.6 d, p4 = 163.9 +/- 2.9 d, and p5 = 204.1 +/- 1.5 d.

We used the integrated intensities and FWHM values of the H-alpha, Ca II H, and Mg II h&amp;k lines to compare with the NLTE radiative transfer computations. Ionization degree and thickness of the prominence plasma could be further derived. Opposite flows are observed along two strands between prominence barbs. The POS velocity can reach 20 km/s and the largest LOS velocity is &gt; 90 km/s. The derived electron densities range from 6.5e9 cm-3 to 2.7e10 cm-3, and the derived total hydrogen densities range from 7.4e9 cm-3 to 6.6e10 cm-3. The temperature ranges from 7 000 to 14 000 K. The ionization degree of hydrogen is in the range of 0.40 to 0.91. The comparison between averaged and modeled profiles of Mg II and Ly-alpha lines shows that macro-velocities of 15 km/s and 20 km/s are required, respectively. The bulk motions among prominence barbs indicate that the prominence plasma is not confined within magnetic dips but exhibits a large-scale behavior. The presence of high-speed cool plasma flows, along with a wide range of plasma densities and temperatures, suggests that the prominence plasma is far from thermodynamic equilibrium and is inherently dynamic in nature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16291" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM-Subaru views of Abell 754: an off-axis, near-line-of-sight merging cluster</a><span class="id">[2510.16291]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report a weak-lensing (WL) mass measurement for the merging cluster Abell 754 and impose constraints on the merger trajectory. The trajectory analysis adopts a two-body model with a point-mass approximation and dynamical friction, refined using numerical simulations of major mergers and characterized by Euler angles. We first conduct WL analysis using the two-dimensional shear pattern from the Subaru HSC in combination with Suprime-Cam images to assist in color selection. The WL mass map shows a distinct double-peak structure located around the western and eastern brightest cluster galaxies as reported in the literature. The two-halo component analysis, which utilizes the 2D shear pattern over the cluster entire region and considers the lensing covariance matrix from uncorrelated large-scale structures, indicates mass values of $M_{200}^W=3.13_{-1.00}^{+1.53}\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$ and $M_{200}^E=6.41_{-1.97}^{+2.92}\times10^{14}h_{70}^{-1}M_\odot$. Thus, the eastern mass component associated with the X-ray tadpole-shaped gas is the main cluster. No substantial structural components are detected in the line-of-sight velocities of the member galaxies. Utilizing WL parameters, line-of-sight velocities, and X-ray information on morphology and kinematics, we determine an impact parameter of approximately 0.77 Mpc at an initial separation of 2 Mpc from the main cluster. The merger plane is inclined at about 20 degrees relative to the line-of-sight. Interestingly, this system is an off-axis, near-line-of-sight merger. This characteristic arises because the trajectory within the merger plane is altered during the pericenter passage, causing the apparent motion to transition from predominantly along the line-of-sight before the core passage to mainly within the plane of the sky afterward. This study will assist in conducting numerical simulations to understand the XRISM observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16353" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Overview of Rossby Wave Instability in Accretion Discs surrounding Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2510.16353]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) has become an important concept in understanding the hydrodynamics (HDs) of accretion discs (ADs), especially in systems around black holes (BHs) where magnetic effects are either weak or absent. This instability is triggered by extrema (or sharp gradients) in the vortensity profile of the disc. Once activated, it leads to non-axisymmetric disturbances that can grow into large-scale vortices. These vortices play a significant role in the outward transport of angular momentum (AM). They may also help explain the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in certain astrophysical systems such as X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we review the main theoretical ideas behind RWI, as well as findings from more advanced three-dimensional (3D) and relativistic simulations. We also mention how the theory has been extended to include magnetic fields and self-gravity(SG) and what these results might imply for actual observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Explodability matters: how realistic neutrino-driven explosions change explosive nucleosynthesis yields</a><span class="id">[2510.16365]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Explosive nucleosynthesis is affected by many uncertainties, particularly regarding assumptions and prescriptions adopted during the evolution of the star. Moreover, simple explosion models are often used in the literature, which can introduce large errors in the assumed explosion energy and mass cut. In this paper, our goal is to analyze the explosion properties and nucleosynthesis of a large range of progenitors from three different stellar evolution codes: FRANEC, KEPLER, and MESA. In particular, we will show the differences between the neutrino-driven explosions simulated in this work with the much simpler bomb and piston models that are typically widely used in the literature. We will then focus on the impact of different explodabilities and different explosion dynamics on the nucleosynthetic yields. We adopt the neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosion code GR1D+, i.e. a spherically symmetric model with state-of-the-art microphysics and neutrino transport and a time-dependent mixing-length model for neutrino-driven convection. We carry out explosions up to several seconds after bounce, and then calculate the nucleosynthetic yields with the post-processing code SkyNet. We find that our 1D+ simulations yield explosion energies and remnant masses in agreement with observations of type II-P, IIb, and Ib supernovae, as well as with the most recent 3D simulations of the explosion. We provide a complete set of yields for all the stars simulated, including rotating, low-metallicity, and binary progenitors. Finally, we find that piston and bomb models, compared to more realistic neutrino-driven explosions, can artificially increase the production of Fe-peak elements, whereas the different explodability tends to cause discrepancies in the lighter elements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Deuteration of water in protoplanetary discs during luminosity outbursts: model predictions for FU Ori discs</a><span class="id">[2510.16564]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminosity outbursts of FU Ori-type objects (FUors) allow us to observe in the gas the molecules that are typically present in the ice in protoplanetary discs. In particular, the fraction of deuterated water, which is usually is mostly frozen in the midplane of a protoplanetary disc, has been measured for the first time in the gas of the disc around a FUor V883 Ori. We test the hypothesis that the observed high HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio in the V883 Ori protoplanetary disc can be explained by luminosity outbursts of different amplitude, including a series of two consecutive outbursts. Using the ANDES astrochemical code, we modelled the distributions of water and deuterated water abundances under the action of luminosity outbursts of different amplitudes (from 400 to 10 000 $L_{\odot}$) and at different stellar luminosities at the pre-outburst stage. We show that the best agreement with the observed HDO/H$_{2}$O profile is obtained for outburst amplitudes of 2 000 and 10 000 $L_{\odot}$, while the observed bolometric luminosity of V883 Ori does not exceed 400 $L_{\odot}$. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy, including the presence of past luminosity outbursts, the age of the star, and the influence of additional heating mechanisms in the midplane of the protoplanetary disc. We also consider how the high observed $\rm HDO/H_{2}O$ ratio may be related to the evolution of the chemical composition of the ice in the protoplanetary disc and the chemical processes activated under outburst conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Manticore-Local Cluster Catalogue: A Posterior Map of Massive Structures in the Nearby Universe</a><span class="id">[2510.16574]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a publicly available catalogue of massive structures in the nearby Universe, constructed from the Manticore-Local posterior ensemble – a Bayesian reconstruction of the local Universe from 2M++ galaxies. We identify massive structures by clustering central haloes at $z = 0$ across the 80 posterior realizations, selecting at most one member per realization. These $\textit{associations}$ serve as probabilistic counterparts to individual massive clusters, each with robust posterior estimates of mass, position, and velocity. The catalogue contains 225 associations with mean masses $\langle M_{200} \rangle &gt; 10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$ persisting in at least 50\% of realizations. We independently validate these systems through stacked \textit{Planck} thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich measurements, which yield significant detections ($&gt;3\sigma$) with amplitudes following the expected $Y$–$M$ relation. Many associations exhibit coherent evolutionary histories: even with only $z = 0$ constraints, the inference narrows each system's possible assembly pathway, localizing progenitor configurations to volumes 2–5 times smaller than mass-matched haloes in unconstrained $\Lambda$CDM simulations. Cross-matches with X-ray catalogues reveal systematic mass-scale differences that align with known observational biases: \textsc{Manticore-Local} masses are typically twice ROSAT-based estimates but agree at unity with weak-lensing-calibrated eROSITA measurements. This demonstrates the catalogue's capability to diagnose systematics on an object-by-object basis. The resulting catalogue provides an observationally consistent map of massive structures in the local Universe, enabling direct cross-probe comparisons, hybrid analyses combining simulated and observed quantities, and systematic mass-scale studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAZ catalog and optical light curves of 7918 blazar-selected AGN</a><span class="id">[2510.16584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the brightest and most variable objects in the universe. Those with relativistic jets observed at small viewing angles are blazars. Due to Doppler-boosting, blazars exhibit extreme stochastic variability. While the origin of this variability is thought to be changes in the accretion flow and jet dynamics, much about blazar variability remains unknown. In this paper we use several blazar-dominated AGN samples to form a catalog of 7918 blazars and candidates – the largest to date. We also collect source types, redshifts, spectral energy distribution (SED) peak frequencies, radio variability Doppler factors, and X-ray flux densities for as many sources as possible. We use all-sky surveys (CRTS, ATLAS, and ZTF, abbreviated as “CAZ”) to extract their optical multiband flux density on a nightly basis between 2007 and 2023, and construct as long and as high cadence light curves as possible for as many sources as attainable. The catalog and its light curves are provided in the accompanying electronic tables, enabling many analyses involving AGN variability with unprecedented sample-sizes. We quantify the variability of the light curves, and apply the Bayesian blocks algorithm to determine their flaring periods. We find: (1) optical flares generally have a faster rise than decay; (2) optical brightness and variability are strongly dependent on the synchrotron peak frequency; (3) flat spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac objects have comparable optical variability and flare characteristics at the same synchrotron peak frequency; and (4) optical flare times tend to decrease and amplitudes increase with increasing radio variability Doppler factor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Association of the IceCube neutrinos with CAZ blazar light curves</a><span class="id">[2510.16585]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decade, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a few hundreds of high-energy (HE) neutrinos from cosmic sources. Despite numerous studies searching for their origin, it is still not known which source populations emit them. A few confident individual associations exist with active galactic nuclei (AGN), mostly with blazars which are jetted AGN whose jet points in our direction. Nonetheless, on a population level, blazar-neutrino correlation strengths are rather weak. This could mean that blazars as a population do not emit HE neutrinos, or that the detection power of the tests is insufficient due to the strong atmospheric neutrino background. By assuming an increase in HE neutrino emission during major blazar flares, in our previous studies we leveraged the arrival time of the neutrinos to boost the detection power. In this paper we utilize the same principle while substantially increasing the number of blazars. We search for the spatio-temporal correlation of 356 IceCube HE neutrinos with major optical flares of 3225 radio- and 3814 $\gamma$-ray-selected blazars. We find that, despite the increase in data size, the number of confident spatio-temporal associations remains low and the overall correlation strengths weak. Two individual associations drive our strongest and the only $&gt;$2$\sigma$ post-trial spatio-temporal correlation, occurring with the BL Lac objects of the radio-selected blazar sample. We estimate that $\lesssim$8\% of the detected cosmic neutrinos were emitted by blazars during major optical flares. As a complementary analysis, we compare the synchrotron peak frequency, redshift, Doppler factor, X-ray brightness, and optical variability of spatially neutrino-associated blazars to those of the general blazar population. We find that spatially neutrino-associated blazars of the tested samples have higher than average Doppler factor and X-ray brightness.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16618" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRAPUM search for pulsars in supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae - II.

No new pulsars were detected for any of the 80 targets, which include some unidentified TeV sources that could be pulsar wind nebulae. The mean upper limit on the flux density of undetected pulsars is 52 $\mu$Jy, which includes the average sensitivity loss across the coherent beam tiling pattern. This survey is the largest and most sensitive multi-target campaign of its kind. We explore the selection effects that precluded discoveries by testing the parameters of the survey iteratively against many simulated populations of young pulsars in supernova remnants. For the synthetic pulsars that were undetected, we find evidence that, after beaming effects are accounted for, about 45 per cent of pulsars are too faint, 30 per cent are too smeared by scattering, and a further 25 per cent have a modelled projected location which places them outside their supernova remnant. The simulations are repeated for the S1 subband of the MeerKAT S-band receivers, resulting in a 50-150 per cent increase in the number of discoveries compared to L-band depending on the flux density limit achieved. Therefore, higher frequency searches that can also achieve improved flux density limits are the best hope for future targeted searches. We also report updated properties for the two previous discoveries, including a polarimetry study of PSR J1831$-$0941 finding a rotation measure of 401$\pm$1 rad m$^2$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serendipitous Discovery of a Faint Planetary Nebula in the Massive Young LMC Cluster NGC 1866</a><span class="id">[2510.16630]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During an integral-field spectroscopic study of stars in the massive young open cluster NGC 1866 in the Large Magellanic Cloud, we serendipitously discovered a faint planetary nebula (PN). We designate it &quot;Ka LMC 1,&quot; and find that its location near the cluster center, along with the agreement of its radial velocity with that of the cluster, imply a high probability of membership in NGC 1866. The 200 Myr age of the cluster indicates that the PN's progenitor star had an initial mass of about 3.9 Msun. The integrated spectrum of Ka LMC 1 shows strong emission lines of [N II], consistent with it being a &quot;Type I&quot; nitrogen-rich PN. The nebula exhibits a classical ring morphology, with a diameter of  6&quot;, corresponding to an advanced expansion age of about 18,000 yr. Archival images of NGC 1866 obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope reveal a faint blue central star. Comparison of the star's luminosity with predictions from one set of theoretical post-asymptotic-giant-branch evolutionary tracks for single stars implies an age roughly consistent with the dynamical age of the PN, but the agreement with alternative modern tracks is much poorer. Analysis of the emission-line spectrum suggests considerable dust extinction within the nebula; however the central star possibly suffers little reddening because we may be viewing it nearly pole-on in a bipolar PN. Our accidental discovery was made using data that are not ideal for study of Ka LMC 1; we suggest several avenues of future targeted studies that would provide valuable and nearly unique new information for constraining models of late stellar evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16647" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thermodynamic and magnetic evolution of an eruptive C-class solar flare observed with SST/TRIPPEL-SP</a><span class="id">[2510.16647]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar flares are complex phenomena driven by the release of magnetic energy, but a large energy reservoir is not sufficient to determine their eruptive potential; the magnetic topology and plasma dynamics play a key role. We investigate the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the solar atmosphere during the rise, peak, and decay phases of a C5.1-class flare and filament eruption in active region NOAA 12561 on 2016 July 7, to understand the origin and atmospheric response of this event. High spatial and spectral resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the chromospheric Ca II 8542A line and nearby photospheric lines were obtained with the TRIPPEL-SP spectropolarimeter at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. Using non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversions and non-force-free field (NFFF) magnetic extrapolations, we followed the event's evolution from its precursor to its decay. Before the flare, our analysis reveals a complex, sheared magnetic topology with a high free energy content ($\sim2\times10^{30}$ erg). In this precursor phase, we detected persistent, localized heating (temperature increase of $\sim$2000 K) with strong downflows ($\sim$10-20 km/s) deep in the atmosphere. This heating was co-spatial with a bald-patch region, suggesting that low-altitude magnetic reconnection could destabilize the filament of the region. The flare's rise phase was marked by the filament's eruption, with a total speed larger than $\sim$70 km/s, when combining inversions and plane-of-sky motions. Following the eruption, the free energy decreased by $\sim$30$\%$ as post-flare loops formed, connecting the flare ribbons and channeling the released energy into the lower atmosphere. The flare ribbons exhibited significant heating to $\sim$8500 K and downflows up to $\sim$10 km/s, consistent with energy deposition along reconnected loops.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHIME-o-Grav: Wideband Timing of Four Millisecond Pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset</a><span class="id">[2510.16668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Wideband timing of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) datasets, where a single time-of-arrival (TOA) and a single dispersion measure (DM) are measured using the entire bandwidth of each observation, was first done for the 12.5-year dataset, and proved to be invaluable for characterizing the time-varying dispersion measure, reducing the data volume, and for improving the overall timing precision.

A defining trait of such systems is the observed underabundance of refractory elements in the stellar photosphere relative to volatile elements – photospheric chemical depletion – resulting from the star accreting volatile-rich circumstellar gas. In this study, we investigated the link between photospheric depletion and disc evolution by focusing on post-AGB/post-RGB binaries with low infrared excess (hereafter “faint disc” targets). We analysed high-resolution optical spectra from HERMES/Mercator and UVES/VLT for 6 Galactic and 2 LMC targets. Using \texttt{E-iSpec}, we homogeneously derived atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of 29 elements from carbon to europium, and included NLTE corrections for 15 elements from carbon to barium that we calculated using pySME and pre-computed grids of departure coefficients. All targets exhibit `saturated' depletion patterns, which we characterised using two-piece linear fits defined by three parameters: initial metallicity ([M/H]$_0$), turn-off temperature ($T_{\rm turn-off}$), and depletion scale ($\nabla_{\rm 100 K}$). Among several findings, we highlight the bimodal distribution of $T_{\rm turn-off}$ in faint disc targets, which allows classification into two subgroups analogous to full discs with continuous, optically thick dust ($T_{\rm turn-off}$ &gt; 1 100 K), and transition discs with inner clearing ($T_{\rm turn-off}$ &lt; 1 100 K). Our results imply that faint disc targets likely represent the final stages of disc dissipation, highlighting the diversity of depletion profiles, the complexity of disc-binary interactions, and the need to understand the rarity and evolution of faint disc systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Properties of current sheets in two-dimensional tearing-mediated magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</a><span class="id">[2510.16707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is well known that the nonlinear evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence generates intermittent current sheets. In the solar wind turbulence, current sheets are frequently observed and they are believed to be an important pathway for the turbulence energy to dissipate and heat the plasma. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of current sheets in a high-resolution two-dimensional simulation of balanced, incompressible MHD turbulence. The simulation parameters are selected such that tearing mode instability is triggered and plasmoids are generated throughout the simulation domain. We develop an automated method to identify current sheets and accurately quantify their key parameters including thickness ($a$), length ($L$), and Lundquist number ($S$). Before the triggering of tearing instability, the current sheet lengths are mostly comparable to the energy injection scale. After the tearing mode onsets, smaller current sheets with lower Lundquist numbers are generated. We find that the aspect ratio ($a/L$) of the current sheets scales approximately as $S^{-1/2}$, i.e. the Sweet-Parker scaling. While a power-law scaling between $L$ and $a$ is observed, no clear correlation is found between the upstream magnetic field strength and thickness $a$. Finally, although the turbulence energy shows anisotropy between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field increment, we do not observe a direct correspondence between the shape of the current sheets and that of the turbulence &quot;eddies.&quot; These results suggest that one needs to be cautious when applying the scale-dependent dynamic alignment model to the analysis of current sheets in MHD turbulence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A transition from mixed-fuel to pure-helium thermonuclear bursts in Terzan 5 X-3/Swift J174805.3-244637</a><span class="id">[2510.16726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We presented a detailed analysis of seven thermonuclear X-ray bursts from Terzan 5 X-3/Swift J174805.3-244637, detected by NICER during the source's 2023 outburst. Our analysis reveals a clear evolution of burst properties, identifying four non-photospheric radius expansion (non-PRE) bursts, one PRE candidate occurring in a mixed hydrogen/helium environment, and two powerful PRE bursts from pure helium ignition. The time-resolved burst spectra were well described by a model including a variable persistent emission component, quantified by a factor $f_a$, due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. The strength of this interaction scales with burst luminosity: the enhancement is absent ($f_a \approx 1$) in the faintest bursts, becomes modest ($f_a \approx 1.5-2$) for the more luminous non-PRE burst and the PRE candidate, and is very strong ($f_a \approx 6-8$) during the pure-helium PRE bursts. This observed transition from mixed-fuel to pure-helium burning as the local mass accretion rate dropped below $\sim$10% of the Eddington limit, $\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$, aligns with theoretical predictions. We verified this scenario with two independent methods. First, at the known distance to Terzan 5, the touchdown luminosities of both the pure helium PRE bursts and the mixed-fuel PRE candidate are consistent with reaching their respective, composition-dependent Eddington limits on the same plausible, massive neutron star of $\sim 2 M_\odot$. Second, the observed recurrence times of the non-PRE bursts were consistent with predictions for mixed-fuel burning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Tunnels and the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect</a><span class="id">[2510.16799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic voids, vast underdensities in the large-scale structure, offer unique sensitivity to cosmological parameters. However, traditional 3D galaxy-based void finding is limited by many factors, including uncertainties in the galaxy-halo connection and distortions from redshift errors. Using alternative tracers and new 2D void definitions can alleviate these limitations and be tailored to maximise the signal for specific observables. Here, we introduce Cosmic Tunnels, a new class of 2D void-like objects traced by galaxy clusters, corresponding to large underdense lines of sight. We identify Cosmic Tunnels by applying the tunnel algorithm to the RASS-MCMF and ACT-MCMF cluster catalogues. We validate their void-like nature by measuring the cross-correlation of Cosmic Tunnels with galaxy density contrast maps from the DESI Legacy Survey (measured at 63$\sigma$ significance), galaxy weak-lensing maps from DES Y3 (31$\sigma$), and CMB weak-lensing maps from ACT DR6 (15$\sigma$), all of which show underdense interiors enclosed by compensation ridges, consistent with 3D galaxy voids, measured at high statistical significance. We also show that the lensing profiles fit the universal HSW void profile, further validating their void-like nature. We cross-correlate the Cosmic Tunnels with Planck CMB temperature maps to measure the ISW signal. Using the ACT-MCMF Cosmic Tunnels, we achieve a 3.6$\sigma$ ISW detection, one of the highest significances ever reported from a single tracer catalogue. These results confirm that Cosmic Tunnels are robust underdense structures and demonstrate their potential as a new tool for cosmological analyses. Finally, we report a tentative detection of a sign flip in the ISW signal at very low redshift (z&lt;0.03), consistent with previous studies, challenging the standard $\Lambda\rm{CDM}$ paradigm.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN Ia-CSM 2020aeuh: Massive binary C/O WD merger?</a><span class="id">[2510.16840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>I explore the origin of the circumstellar (CS) shell of the unusual SN Ia 2020aeuh based on the light curve model abd observational constraints.

While their impact on disc-integrated spectra is well established, detailed studies of the underlying local line profiles have so far been limited to the Sun. We present an observational campaign targeting the active star WASP-85 A during transits of its hot Jupiter companion. The transits span two stellar rotation periods, allowing us to probe the evolution of active regions. From ground-based photometry we identify seven active regions, six containing dark spots. Using simultaneous ESPRESSO transit spectroscopy, we spatially resolve these regions on the stellar surface by using the planet as a probe. We detect significant bisector shape changes, line broadening, and net redshifts during spot occultations, with velocity shifts of 108-333 m/s (mean uncertainty 50 m/s). The observed broadening is consistent with the Zeeman effect, implying magnetic field strengths (Stokes $I$) $B$ = 2.7-4.4 kG (mean uncertainty 0.6 kG), comparable to solar umbrae. Combined with our photometric spot model, this yields lower limits to the disc-integrated field $Bf = 16 \pm 3$ G and $61 \pm 9$ G for the two hemispheres probed – at least three times higher than Sun-as-a-star values. We also measure centre-to-limb variations in FWHM, line depth, equivalent width, and convective blueshift, which broadly agree with solar observations and 3D MHD models. This work demonstrates a new way to characterise the surfaces of exoplanet host stars, paving the way for future analyses incorporating synthetic line profiles from 3D MHD simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16902" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The massive binary system WR 20a: light curve analysis in a colliding wind model</a><span class="id">[2510.16902]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The article presents the results of the analysis of optical light curves of the massive binary system WR 20a (WN 6ha + WN 6ha). The analysis was performed with the binary system model, extending the standard Roche model for the case when both components of the system have powerful stellar winds. The model takes into account the collision of the winds and the influence of orbital motion on the collision zone. The observational light curves in the BVI filters were taken from previously published papers, in which they were analyzed using the standard Roche model. The main difference between the results of our work and the previous results is that in our model the radii of the components are about 25% smaller. As a consequence, the luminosity of the system in our model decreased by approximately 40%, and the distance to the system by 20%. In addition, the model was able to successfully describe the observed asymmetry of the light curve with respect to the phases of the conjunctions, which is impossible in the standard Roche model. The model light curves were also compared with the observational curves obtained by the TESS satellite and the ASAS-SN project. It was shown that, taking into account recent studies of interstellar extinction in the direction of the young open cluster Westerlund 2, the distance to WR 20a obtained in our calculations is consistent with the hypothesis that WR 20a is a member of the cluster.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17012" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HelioFill: Diffusion-Based Model for EUV Reconstruction of the Solar Farside</a><span class="id">[2510.17012]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The loss of STEREO-B in 2014 created a persistent blind spot in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imaging of the solar farside.

Trained on full-Sun maps from 2011-2014 (when SDO+STEREO-A+B provided 360 degrees coverage), HelioFill couples a latent diffusion backbone with domain-specific additions: spectral gating, confidence weighting, and auxiliary regularizers, to produce operationally suitable 304 Angstrom reconstructions. On held-out data, the model preserves the observed hemisphere with mean SSIM 0.871 and mean PSNR 25.56 dB, while reconstructing the masked hemisphere with mean SSIM 0.801 and mean PSNR 17.41 dB and reducing boundary error by approximately 21 percent (Seam L2) compared to a state-of-the-art diffusion inpainting model. The generated maps maintain cross-limb continuity and coronal morphology (loops, active regions, and coronal-hole boundaries), supporting synoptic products and cleaner inner-boundary conditions for coronal/heliospheric models. By filling observational gaps with observationally consistent EUV emission, HelioFill maintains continuity of full-Sun monitoring and complements helioseismic farside detections, illustrating how diffusion models can extend the effective utility of existing solar imaging assets for space-weather operations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17032" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Binary Population Synthesis to Calculate the Yields of Low- and Intermediate-Mass Binary Populations at Low Metallicity</a><span class="id">[2510.17032]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are important to chemical evolution at metallicity $Z \sim 0.0001$ ($\text{[Fe/H]} \approx -2.2$) as they contribute significantly to the production of nitrogen, lead, and dust in the early Universe. The contribution of AGB stars to the chemical evolution of the Universe is often quantified using the chemical yields from single AGB stars. Binary evolution challenges our understanding of chemical evolution as binary phenomena such as mergers and mass transfer episodes can significantly alter the stellar evolution pathways and yields. In this work, we use binary population synthesis code binary_c to model populations of low and intermediate-mass ($\sim 0.7-7 \, M_{\rm \odot}$) stars at metallicity $Z = 0.0001$. Our binary star populations predict $\sim 37\%$ fewer thermally-pulsing AGB stars than our single star populations, leading to a $\sim 40\%$ decrease in the amount of ejected C and a $\sim 35-40\%$ reduction in elements synthesised through the slow neutron capture process. The uncertainty introduced by the mass-loss from stellar winds on the AGB makes the impact of binary evolution on the total amount of ejected N uncertain. The total N yield ejected by our binary star populations ranges from a $17\%$ to a $36\%$ decrease compared to our single star populations. However, our binary populations overproduce N by over an order of magnitude during the period $300-700\,$Myr after formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reconnection-driven Decaying Pulsations Modulated by Slow Magnetoacoustic Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.17077]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Decaying pulsations have been simultaneously detected in the low-energy X-rays of solar/stellar flares, which are supposed to be associated with standing slow magnetoacoustic or kink-mode waves. The physical mechanism behind rapidly decaying remains unknown. We present the detection of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with rapidly decaying in high-energy emissions produced in two major flares on 10 January and 14 May 2024. Using empirical mode decomposition, decaying QPPs are identified in hard X-ray and microwave emissions during the flare impulsive phase, suggesting a process of oscillatory magnetic reconnection. The quasi-periods and decay times are determined by a damped harmonic function, which are approximately 177$\pm$8 s (249$\pm$25 s) and 118$\pm$4 s (124$\pm$5 s), respectively. The restructured X-ray images reveal double footpoints connected by hot flare loops. Their phase speeds are estimated to about 400 km/s and 670 km/s, both below the local sound speed in high-temperature plasmas, indicating the presence of slow-mode waves in hot flare loops. We perform coronal diagnostics based on standing slow-mode waves and derive key physical parameters, including the polytropic index, the thermal ratio, viscous ratio and radiation ratio, which are consistent with previous results. Our observations support that the decaying QPPs are triggered by oscillatory magnetic reconnection that is modulated by standing slow magnetoacoustic waves, with their rapid decay attributable to a co-effect of viscous damping and localized magnetic reconnection rate.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Origin of Unusual Composition of 3He-Rich Solar Energetic Particles</a><span class="id">[2510.17100]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) detected on 2023 October 24-25 by Solar Orbiter at 0.47 au. The measurements revealed that heavy-ion enhancements increase irregularly with mass, peaking at S. C, and especially N, Si, and S, stand out in the enhancement pattern with large abundances. Except for 3He, heavy ion spectra can only be measured below 0.5 MeV/nucleon. At 0.386 MeV/nucleon, the event showed a huge 3He/4He ratio of 75.2+/-33.9, larger than previously observed. Solar Dynamics Observatory extreme ultraviolet data showed a mini filament eruption at the solar source of 3He-rich SEPs that triggered a straight tiny jet. Located at the boundary of a low-latitude coronal hole, the jet base is a bright, small-scale region with a supergranulation scale size. The emission measure provides relatively cold source temperatures of 1.5 to 1.7 MK between the filament eruption and nonthermal type III radio burst onset. The analysis suggests that the emission measure distribution of temperature in the solar source could be a factor that affects the preferential selection of heavy ions for heating or acceleration, thus shaping the observed enhancement pattern. Including previously reported similar events indicates that the eruption of the mini filament is a common feature of events with heavy-ion enhancement not ordered by mass. Surprisingly, sources with weak magnetic fields showed extreme 3He enrichment in these events. Moreover, the energy attained by heavy ions seems to be influenced by the size and form of jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17104" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optimizing Kilonova Searches: A Case Study of the Type IIb SN 2025ulz in the Localization Volume of the Low-Significance Gravitational Wave Event S250818k</a><span class="id">[2510.17104]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients.

Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there are $\geq 4$ candidates with a score more promising than SN 2025ulz.

These jets occurred on 2022-10-29 around 19:10 UT in a quiet Sun region and their main axis aligns with the overarching magnetic structure traced by a cluster of spicules. However, they develop a helical morphology, while the H$\alpha$ spicules maintain straight, linear trajectories elsewhere. Alongside the spicules, thin, elongated red- and blue-shifted H$\alpha$ features appear to envelope the EUV jets, which we tentatively call sheath flows. The EUI jet moving upward at speed of  110 km/s is joined by strong H$\alpha$ red-shift  20 km/s to form the bidirectional outflows lasting  2 min. Using AI-assisted differential emission measure (DEM) analysis of SolO's Full Sun Imager (FSI) we derived total energy of the EUV jet as  $1.9 \times 10^{26}$ erg with 87% in thermal energy and 13% in kinetic energy.

Understanding the origin of this enrichment is crucial for identifying the mechanisms behind SEP generation. We investigate the origin of 3He enrichment in high-energy (25-50 MeV) solar proton events observed by SOHO, selecting events that coincide with &lt;1 MeV/nucleon 3He-rich periods detected by ACE during 1997-2021. The identified 3He enhancements include cases where material from independent impulsive (3He-rich) SEP events is mixed with GSEP proton populations. Two high-energy proton events exhibit elemental composition and solar source characteristics consistent with ISEPs. Extreme-ultraviolet imaging from SDO and STEREO reveals narrow, jet-like eruptions in the parent active regions of about 60% of the remaining events. Notably, the highest 3He/4He ratios occur when coronal jets are present, consistent with fresh, jet-driven injection of suprathermal 3He that is subsequently re-accelerated during the event. Correspondingly, jet-associated events show fewer pre-event (residual) 3He counts, indicating that enrichment in these cases does not primarily come from remnant material. We find a positive correlation between 3He/4He and Fe/O, strongest in jet-associated events, consistent with a common jet-supplied seed population re-accelerated by the CME shock.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17192" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parametric strong lensing model of the galaxy cluster Abell 2390 from Euclid and MUSE observations</a><span class="id">[2510.17192]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new high precision parametric strong lensing total mass reconstruction of the Euclid Early Release Observations (ERO) galaxy cluster Abell 2390, at redshift z = 0.231.

After fully reanalysing the MUSE spectroscopy, we combine it with archival spectroscopic catalogues allowing us to select 65 secure cluster members. This sample is further complemented with 114 photometric member galaxies, identified within the Euclid VIS and NISP imaging down to magnitude H = 23. We also measure the stellar velocity dispersions for 22 cluster members, in order to calibrate the Faber-Jackson relation and hence the scaling relations for the subhalo mass components. We test and compare 11 total mass parametrisations of the galaxy cluster with increasing complexity. To do so, we employ the new parametric strong lensing modelling code this http URL . Our best fit total mass parametrisation is characterised by a single large scale halo, 179 subhalo components, and an external shear term. The reference model yields a mean scatter between the model predicted and observed positions of the multiple images of 0.32 arcseconds. We are able to quantify the systematics arising from our modelling choices by taking advantage of all the different explored total mass parametrisations. When our results are compared with those from other lensing studies, we notice an overall agreement in the reconstructed cluster total mass profile in the outermost strong lensing regime: the discrepancy in the innermost region of the cluster (few kiloparsec from the brightest cluster galaxy, where few or no strong lensing features are observed) could possibly be ascribed to the different data and modelling choices.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axion inflation in the regime of homogeneous backreaction</a><span class="id">[2510.17207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) produced in models of axion inflation coupled to gauge fields.

Numerical studies based on the approximation of homogeneous backreaction (i.e., neglecting inhomogeneities of the inflaton field) exhibit oscillations in the inflaton velocity, with corresponding peaks in the SGWB spectrum. The most recent lattice simulations have questioned the validity of this regime, showing examples characterized by a rapid increase in the inflaton gradient energy and the breakdown of homogeneous backreaction. We compute this energy density perturbatively within the assumption of homogeneous backreaction, obtaining examples with a detectable SGWB and with an inflaton gradient energy that remains subdominant to the inflaton zero-mode kinetic energy throughout inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measurement of the Iron Spectrum with the MAGIC Telescopes</a><span class="id">[2510.17219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Iron cosmic rays represent the most abundant heavy nuclei at energies above 1 TeV, with their production thought to be primarily originated by astrophysical sources.

While recent results from space-based detectors have revealed unexpected energy dependences in the GeV-TeV range, these measurements are limited by low statistics at higher energies. At energies above a few TeV, ground-based detectors, such as the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes, become more effective due to their large collec- tion areas, enabling them to extend and complement the capabilities of space-borne instruments. In this work, we apply the so-called direct Cherenkov technique, which accounts for the radiation emitted by charged particles before the cascade develops in the atmosphere, with MAGIC to identify iron-induced air showers and distinguish them from those produced by lighter cosmic-ray species.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17225" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Overview of the Effect of Self-Gravity on the Structure of Accretion Discs</a><span class="id">[2510.17225]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In astrophysical systems like X-ray binaries (XRBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), and young stellar objects (YSOs), we often observe a very fundamental structure called accretion discs(ADs).

This assumption breaks down when the mass of the disc becomes considerable in contrast to that of the massive central object. In these cases, the AD's self-gravity (SG) can drastically change its structure, dynamics, and evolution. This review investigates how SG influences the radial and vertical structure of ADs and how it modifies the mechanisms that transport angular momentum (AM).

To address this, we utilize the 20-year Swift archival data, which provides a substantial sample of joint soft X-ray and gamma-ray observations, enabling a systematic joint spectral study. We resolve 110 temporal pulses from 46 GRBs and find that a single power-law model with a low-energy break or cutoff adequately describes the prompt spectra from 150 keV down to 0.5 keV. More than half of the sample pulses require a break around a few keV, with average spectral indices $\langle \alpha_1 \rangle = -0.88$ and $\langle \alpha_2 \rangle = -1.46$ consistent with synchrotron radiation in a marginally fast-cooling regime. The observed spectral evolution and the distribution of indices support a single-emission-region origin, where the varying spectral shapes are largely governed by the evolution of the synchrotron cooling frequency $\nu_c$ and the effect of finite emission width. The observed differences in the temporal behavior between X-ray and gamma-ray light curves can be naturally explained by this spectral evolution across the broad band.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17357" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron impact excitation of Te IV and V and Level Resolved R-matrix Photoionization of Te I - IV with application to modelling of AT2017gfo</a><span class="id">[2510.17357]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectral modelling of kilonovae (KNe) require large amounts of collisional excitation and photoionization atomic data for lowly ionised (neutral, singly and doubly ionised) species of heavy elements.

They are defined as layers where the rotation of the radiative interior transitions to the differential rotation of the convective envelope, generating strong shear and turbulence. As such, understanding the dynamics of the transport and mixing inside stellar tachoclines would shed light on how the dynamical processes of the convection zone might affect the secular transport of the radiative zone. In particular, we investigate how the change of the latitudinal differential rotation in the convection zone with stellar evolution would affect the dynamics of the tachocline. Indeed, as solar-type stars are braked on the Main Sequence, the differential rotation in the convection zone is expected to evolve from a cylindrical rapidly-rotating regime (columns of varying velocities, aligned with the rotation axis) to a conical solar-like regime (with an equatorial acceleration as in the case of the Sun) and finally to a conical anti-solar-like regime (with a polar acceleration). However, stellar evolutionary codes currently only consider at best the solar conical regime to study the dynamics of stellar tachoclines throughout the evolution of stars. We discuss different possibilities to model hydrodynamical tachoclines and we show that Mathis Zahn 2004's formalism is able to treat coherently hydrodynamical stellar tachoclines when taken in the thin layer approximation. We use it to model the differential rotation, meridional circulation, and mixing coefficients inside the tachocline in order to examine the effect of the different rotation regimes on the transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dark Matters at ICRC 2025</a><span class="id">[2510.17473]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dark matter track at ICRC 2025 showed a field in transition.

We report three key results: (1) for the first time, we assess the convective stability of magnetized remnants, extending previous unmagnetized analyses; (2) we identify a clear secondary peak in the gravitational-wave spectrum of pulsar-like configurations, consistent with the nonlinear coupling of the $m=0$ and $m=2$ modes, which is absent in other topologies; and (3) the magnetic field topology strongly influences the gravitational wave emission properties to the extent that nearby ($&lt;50\,{\rm Mpc}$) events could allow one to observationally distinguish between different field structures with future gravitational-wave detectors. Across all models, we obtain luminosities compatible with short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), with purely poloidal configurations being the most efficient in driving possible relativistic jets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highlights from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</a><span class="id">[2510.17523]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The IceCube neutrino observatory has been successfully operating in its full configuration for almost 15 years and is characterized by a remarkably high stability and uptime.

However, it remains uncertain if the emission is related to flare-like activity similar to the Sun or magnetospheric process akin to magnetized planets. Using observations (1.0 - 1.5 GHz) taken by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, we found a type of millisecond-scale radio bursts with exceptionally high frequency drift rates ($\sim 8\;\rm{GHz\;s^{-1}}$) from an active M dwarf, AD Leo. The ultrafast drift rates point to a source region with a notably low magnetic scale height ($&lt;0.15\; r_\star$, $r_\star$ as the stellar radius), a feature not expected in a commonly assumed dipole-like global field but highly possible in localized strong-field structures, i.e. starspots. Our findings suggest that a concentrated magnetic field above starspots could be responsible for some of the most intense radio bursts from M dwarfs, supporting a solar-like electron acceleration mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Production of gravitational waves by inflationary transitions in aligned natural inflation</a><span class="id">[2510.17556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The original axion natural inflation model predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio exceeding experimental limits. Conversely, in aligned axion inflation, inflation can proceed along trajectories emerging from near a saddle point of the two-field potential and ending through an instability in the orthogonal direction. Such solutions satisfy present observational limits and will be tested by future CMB experiments. Previous studies have suggested the possibility of two distinct inflationary stages separated by a transition characterized by rapid oscillations of the fields. In this work, we demonstrate that the existence of these two stages is a generic feature of the model. We explore a possible phenomenological signature of the transition when a U(1) gauge field is coupled to the axions, namely, the production of gravitational waves (GWs) sourced by gauge quanta generated during the transition. This mechanism produces a feature similar to those seen in spectator axion models or axion inflation with appropriate potentials, i.e. a strongly scale-dependent power spectrum. The scale at which the GW spectrum is produced is determined by the duration of the second inflationary phase. Consequently, the spectrum may peak at different frequencies, potentially detectable by future GW experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17574" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar characterization, Magnesium Abundances and Chromospheric Activity Analysis of Stars with Confirmed Exoplanets from the K2 mission</a><span class="id">[2510.17574]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a homogeneous spectroscopic analysis of confirmed K2 mission exoplanet-hosting stars, comprising 301 targets with high-resolution optical spectra from HIRES and TRES taken from ExoFOP.

Three estimates of stellar masses and radii were obtained via Stefan-Boltzmann and isochrone methods using the codes PARAM and isochrones. These were used to derive exoplanetary radii reaching internal precisions of 2.5%, 2.6%, and 6.6%, respectively, and the radius gap being consistently detected near 1.9 R$_{\oplus}$. We measured chromospheric activity from the Ca II H &amp; K and H$\alpha$ lines. Within the low-activity range ($\log R^{\prime}_{HK} &lt; -4.75$), stellar activity appears to decrease with increasing planetary radius from super-Earths, sub-Neptunes, sub-Saturns, into the Jupiter regime. According to the [Mg/Fe] measurements, most of our K2 planet hosts belong to the Galactic thin disk, but our sample has a population from the thick disk (high-alpha sequence). Most stars show consistent chemo-dynamical behavior. We find that the [Mg/Fe] ratios are indistinguishable between systems containing Large or Small exoplanets, as well as Single- or Multi-exoplanetary systems. Both the [Fe/H] and [Mg/H] distributions reveal that stars hosting large planets are more iron- and magnesium-enhanced than those having only small planets, further confirming the link between stellar abundances and exoplanetary size, but no significant differences are found between the Single- versus Multi-exoplanetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid preparation: The flat-sky approximation for the clustering of Euclid's photometric galaxies</a><span class="id">[2510.17592]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compare the performance of the flat-sky approximation and Limber approximation for the clustering analysis of the photometric galaxy catalogue of Euclid.

Despite huge efforts on understanding the main ingredients triggering such explosions, we still lack of compelling evidences for the precise mechanism driving those phenomena. They are expected to produce gravitational waves due to asymmetric mass motions in the collapsing core, and emit in the meanwhile neutrinos as a result of the interactions in their high-density environment. The combination of these two cosmic messengers can provide a unique probe to study the inner engine of these processes and unveil the explosion mechanism. Among the possible detectable signature, standing accretion shock instabilities (SASI) are particularly relevant in this context as they establish a direct connection between gravitational wave emission and the outcoming neutrino flux. In this work, Hilbert-Huang transform is applied to a selected sample of 3D numerical simulations, with the aim of identifying SASI contribution and extract its instantaneous frequency.

Expecting a high frequency of breakouts within circumstellar material (CSM), we have produced an extended, regular and cubic grid of models covering from low- to high-energy explosions, compact to extended CSM, moderate- to high-density CSM. Here, we document the main results from the radiation-hydrodynamics and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer calculations over the first 15d of evolution, including the bolometric and multi-band light curves and the salient features from spectra. As before, CSM interaction is found to boost the UV brightness and shorten the optical rise time if compact. Higher ionization (e.g., as seen with OVI3820A) is obtained for more compact CSM, and is maximum for explosions in a vacuum. CSM interaction also diversifies the spectral evolution as seen in line profile morphology, with electron-scattering broadening dominating during the IIn phase. In the absence of CSM, Doppler broadening dominates immediately after shock breakout and leads to strongly blueshifted emission in lines such as HeII4686A or CIV5805A. This treasury of models will be used to analyze as well as predict future observations of RSG shock breakouts in CSM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17696" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clumpy Outflows from Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes I: Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations and Observational Implications</a><span class="id">[2510.17696]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent advances in X-ray spectroscopic observation have enabled researchers to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows. In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles, exhibiting typical properties such as a size of  10 rg (where rg is the gravitational radius), a velocity of  0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of 10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is approximately 1-10.

These sources were all identified via a single pulse search. Most of them are likely to be rotating radio transients (RRATs) given their low pulse rates. Using data captured in our transient buffer we have localised nine sources in the image domain to arcsecond precision. This facilitates the timing of these sources and further follow-up with other telescopes. Using the arrival times of single pulses, we have constrained the periods of 14 sources, ranging from 121ms to 7.623s, and derived a phase-coherent timing solution for one of them. Follow-up observations of the MeerTRAP sources (including those published previously) performed with the Effelsberg telescope have detected regular but faint emission from three sources, confirming their long rotation period, including PSR J2218+2902 with a period of 17.5s, the fourth slowest in the radio pulsar population. A few of the sources exhibit interesting emission features, such as periodic microstructure in PSR J1243-0435 and possible nulling in PSR J1911-2020 and PSR J1243-0435. We find that the duty cycles of the three newly discovered pulsars are very low and follow the general trend for the duty cycle with period of known pulsars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of super-Earths around low-mass stars: evolution of an icy dead zone</a><span class="id">[2510.17767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Exoplanet observations show that close-in super-Earths are more common around M-dwarfs than around solar mass stars. Since the snow line in a protoplanetary disc plays a crucial role in determining the amount of solid material available for planet formation, we explore the icy regions of protoplanetary discs around stars with masses 0.1, 0.5 and 1 $\rm M_\odot$. In a protoplanetary disc, a dead zone, where the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is suppressed, provides a quiescent region for solids to settle to the mid-plane and planets to form. Viscosity may be driven in the dead zone by gravitational instability if enough material builds up. Heating from the gravitational instability can trigger the MRI and an accretion outburst onto the star. There may be two icy regions in a disc: (1) far from the star and (2) in the dead zone close to the star. We solve the 1D disc equations to find steady state solutions and time-dependent evolution with different values for the critical surface density in the MRI-active surface layers. Larger surface density in the MRI-active surface layers reduces the extent and lifetime of the inner icy region. The inner icy region in the dead zone around a solar mass star is small and short-lived. Around M-dwarfs, the size of the inner icy region is more persistent and oscillates between the accretion outbursts in the region 0.1-1 au. An extended icy region within the dead zone of a disc around M-dwarfs may promote the formation of more numerous and massive close-in super-Earths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A High-Resolution Spectroscopic Survey of Directly Imaged Companion Hosts: II.

Accurate inference of planet formation using these elemental abundances require the corresponding abundance measurements for the host star. We present the second set of results from our high-resolution spectroscopic survey of directly imaged companion host stars, measuring abundances of 16 elements (including C, O, Na, Mg, Si, S, K and Fe) for five directly imaged companion host stars. Using both the spectral fitting and the equivalent width methods, we find solar C/O ratios for HR 2562 (0.58 $\pm$ 0.09), AB Pic (0.50 $\pm$ 0.14), and YSES 1 (0.45 $\pm$ 0.05), and sub-solar C/O ratios for PZ Tel (0.28 $\pm$ 0.05) and $\beta$ Pic (0.22 $\pm$ 0.06). The $4\sigma$ sub-solar C/O detections for PZ Tel and $\beta$ Pic highlight the importance of accurate stellar C/O estimates for constraining planet formation. Subsequently, we combine our abundances with those from our previous work to measure population-level average elemental abundances. We find super-solar carbon and oxygen for this stellar population, indicating that the protoplanetary disks around these stars were potentially rich in volatiles. We compare stellar C/O to those of their companions, revealing super-stellar C/O for several objects that suggest planet-like formation mechanisms.

We employ a perturbative bias expansion in Eulerian space to describe the clustering of galaxies, modelling the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop and tree level, respectively. This allows us to use the power spectrum to self-consistently calibrate the perturbative bias parameters. We validate this model against an $N$-body simulation, and show that it can be used up to scales of at least $k_{\rm max}^P\simeq 0.2\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ and $k_{\rm max}^B\simeq 0.08\,h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, saturating the information recovered from the data. We obtain constraints on the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8=0.761\pm 0.020$ and the non-relativistic matter fraction $\Omega_m=0.307\pm 0.015$, as well as the combination $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.769 \pm 0.020$. Including the galaxy bispectrum leads to a $10$-$20\%$ improvement on the cosmological constraints, which are also in good agreement with previous analyses of the same data, and in mild tension with Planck at the $\sim2.5\sigma$ level. This tension is largely present in the standard two-point function dataset, and the addition of the bispectrum increases it slightly, marginally shifting $\sigma_8$ downwards and $\Omega_m$ upwards. Finally, using the bispectrum allows for a substantially more precise measurement of the bias parameters of this sample, which are in reasonable agreement with existing coevolution relations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating</a><span class="id">[2507.23684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16112" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spin-aligned inspiral waveforms from self-force and post-Newtonian theory</a><span class="id">[2510.16112]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the state-of-the-art waveform model WaSABI-C for quasicircular inspirals of spinning black hole binaries with aligned or anti-aligned spins.

Using 1,338.6 live days of data collected with a one-ton prototype detector for the Jinping Neutrino Experiment, we measured the underground muon flux originating from air showers. The results show discrepancies of about 40%, corresponding to a significance of more than 5.5$\sigma$, relative to predictions from several leading hadronic interaction models. We interpret these findings from two complementary perspectives: (i) by adopting the expected cosmic ray spectra, we constrain the modeling of the initial hadronic interactions in air showers; and (ii) by assuming specific hadronic interaction models, we infer the mass composition of cosmic rays, and our data favor a lighter component in the corresponding energy range.

This suggests that nonlinear mode coupling contributes significantly to the ringdown phase, opening a new avenue to probe strong-field gravity beyond linear approximations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16921" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imprints of a Second Order Electroweak Phase Transition on the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2510.16921]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we shall study the impact of a second order electroweak phase transition occurring at $\sim 150\,$GeV on the energy spectrum of the stochastic gravitational background. Specifically, we assume that the non-minimally coupled Higgs field controls the inflationary era, we find the reheating temperature for the Higgs inflationary model and we demonstrate that the Higgs effective potential exhibits a very weak first order phase transition. This weak first order phase transition is an indication that the electroweak phase transition may not actually proceed as a first order phase transition, but it will proceed as a crossover or second order phase transition. This second order phase transition proceeds with the Higgs field slow-rolling its potential toward to its new minimum. This slow-rolling may deform the radiation domination total equation of state, and the aim of this work is to pinpoint the observational imprints of this total equation of state deformation on the energy spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves, that affects modes that enter the horizon at temperatures $T\sim 150\,$GeV or lower.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The window on heavy charged dark matter was never open</a><span class="id">[2510.17026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>There is a claim in the literature that charged dark matter particles in the mass range $100 (q_{\rm X}/e)^2~\mathrm{TeV} \leq m_{\rm X} \leq 10^8 (q_{\rm X}/e)~\mathrm{TeV}$ are allowed, based on arguing that heavy charged particles cannot reach the Earth from outside the magnetized region of the Milky Way (Chuzhoy-Kolb, 2009).

This phenomenon, known as the (inverse) Gertsenshtein effect, is typically analyzed in Minkowski spacetime, neglecting the spacetime curvature induced by the magnetic field itself. This paper investigates, for the first time, the influence of spacetime curvature on the (inverse) Gertsenshtein effect. To this end, we first determine the metric perturbation from Minkowski spacetime up to second order in the magnetic field strength, assuming cylindrical symmetry. We also discuss the ambiguities in the form of the metric perturbation arising from gauge freedom and boundary conditions. Using the geometric optics approximation, we then derive a set of coupled equations governing the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves in the resulting curved spacetime. These equations are solved for two specific scenarios: a plane wave and a spherical wave. From the solutions, we compute the evolution of the wave amplitudes and the associated energy fluxes. Our analysis reveals that two competing effects govern the amplitude evolution: magnification due to the focusing of waves by spacetime curvature, and attenuation due to wave conversion via the Gertsenshtein effect. In the plane wave case, these effects precisely cancel, resulting in no net change in amplitude. In contrast, for the spherical wave, the Gertsenshtein effect dominates over focusing, leading to an overall reduction in amplitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Stars to Waves: Non-deterministic Inference of Microlensed Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2510.17125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Strongly lensed gravitational waves may pass through the stellar field of a lensing galaxy with additional modulations (on both phase and amplitude) due to gravitational microlensing effect of stars/remnants near the line of sight.

We classify the detection and parameter estimation of such events as non-deterministic inference problem and propose a solution with the implementation of normalizing flows. As a first step, we show that $8\%$ of microlensed events can be detected with significance $\ge 3 \sigma$ in the third generation era, with the chosen microlensing parameters correlated with the density of the underlying stellar field. This approach opens the door to probing microlensing effects and the properties of the underlying stellar fields.

These sources will spend $\sim 10^5$ cycles in band, and are therefore sensitive to tiny changes in the general-relativistic dynamics, potentially induced by astrophysical environments or modifications of general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown that these effects can be highly degenerate for a single source. However, it may be possible to distinguish between them at the population level, because environmental effects should impact only a fraction of the sources, while modifications of GR would affect all. We therefore introduce a population-based hierarchical framework to disentangle the two hypotheses. Using simulated EMRI populations, we perform tests of the null vacuum-GR hypothesis and two alternative beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses, namely migration torques (environmental effects) and time-varying $G$ (modified gravity). We find that with as few as $\approx 20$ detected sources, our framework can statistically distinguish between these three hypotheses, and even indicate if both environmental and modified gravity effects are simultaneously present in the population. Our framework can be applied to other models of beyond-vacuum-GR effects available in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.17449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations.

ISN helium, which is the most abundant species at 1 au, is directly observed by space missions, such as Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). However, some of these atoms are ionized by solar ultraviolet radiation before reaching 1 au, producing pickup ions (PUIs). A recent analysis of IBEX data suggests that the helium photoionization rates predicted by models are underestimated by up to 40%. The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on board New Horizons enables the study of PUIs giving complementary insight into the other side of the ionization process. Our goal is to verify this increased helium ionization by determining the ionization rate of ISN helium in the heliosphere based on the SWAP observations of helium PUIs. For this purpose, we analyze SWAP data collected between 2012 and 2022, at distances 22 to 54 au from the Sun. We develop a new method for fitting model distribution functions to the observational data using the maximum likelihood method. Our approach accounts for the spacecraft's rotation and the SWAP response function, which depends on both energy and inflow direction. We estimate SWAP's efficiency for helium relative to that for hydrogen and determine the ISN helium ionization rate. We find that the photoionization rate obtained from the SWAP observations is 43% larger than the rates predicted by models, confirming the IBEX results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Phantom scalar field with arbitrary potential: accelerating scaling attractors</a><span class="id">[2510.17765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this article, we investigate the dynamics of a phantom scalar field with an arbitrary potential, focusing on accelerating scaling solutions of cosmological relevance. We consider both uncoupled and coupled cosmological scenarios. In the latter case, the coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the dissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The evolution equations of our coupled and uncoupled cosmological models are written in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the only requirement imposed on the phantom scalar-field potential is that a specific dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its derivative, must be invertible. We show that the uncoupled phantom cosmological model cannot accommodate any accelerated scaling solution, while such solutions do exist in the coupled scenario, for both constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions $-$ specifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a long enough matter-dominated era $-$ our results show that the existence of a direct coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great potential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive analysis of time-domain overlapping gravitational wave transients: A Lensing Study</a><span class="id">[2510.17787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Next-generation GW detectors will produce a high rate of temporally overlapping signals from unrelated compact binary coalescences. Such overlaps can bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical effects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how overlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on two scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated point-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with chirp-mass ratios $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1,\,2\}$, SNR ratios $\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm B}/\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1\}$, and coalescence-time offsets $\Delta t_{\rm c}\in[-0.1,\,0.1]~\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian PE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is favored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\log_{10}\mathscr{B}^{\rm L}_{\rm U}&gt;1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\gtrsim1$ and $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|\leq0.03~\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can arise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two superimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|$. Overall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios, relative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs of the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping black-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are likely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected to become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study focuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds, the findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17789" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exorcising ghosts with gravitational waves: cases of ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.17789]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>General Relativity (GR) is an effective field theory valid in the infrared regime. Quadratic curvature extensions intended to probe ultraviolet physics generically propagate a massive spin-$2$ ghost and are therefore non-unitary. One route to remove ghost is by enlarging the geometric sector (torsion, non-metricity). We investigate the infrared phenomenology of both the standard (ghostful) and ghost-free fourth-order gravity theories by computing Gravitational Wave (GW) emission and confronting the results with observations such as the orbital-period decay of quasi-stable binaries such as PSR B1913+16 and PSR J1738+0333 and the chirp-mass evolution of GW170817. In the ghostful theory, besides the theoretical inconsistency due to non-unitarity, there are also phenomenological problems: the massless spin-$2$ GW flux cancels the combined GW fluxes of the massive spin-$2$ ghost and massive spin-$0$ scalar in the vanishing-mass limit, so the GR quadrupole formula is not recovered at the leading order. As a result, we obtain the GW constraint on the ghostful theory as $m\gtrsim 10^{-11}~\mathrm{eV}$, where $m$ is the mass of the massive modes. By contrast, the ghost-free theory smoothly reproduces the Newtonian potential and GR quadrupole formulae when the two coupling constants $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ vanish, independently of the mass $m$. Therefore, GW observations put mass-dependent upper bounds on the size of the coupling constants. For example, if we assume $\alpha_1\simeq\alpha_2$ for simplicity, then we obtain $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 4.2\times 10^{83}$ for $m\sim 3\times 10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$ and $\alpha_{1,2}\lesssim 1.3\times 10^{75}$ for $m\sim 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}$. To our knowledge, these are the first astrophysical-scale bounds reported for ghostful and ghost-free fourth-order gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of propagation effects on the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2412.00232]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a mathematical analysis of propagation-induced distortions in the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Within the Triggered Relativistic Dynamical Model, we derive a centroid-based formulation of the sub-burst slope law, which is an inverse relation between frequency-drift rate and temporal width of sub-bursts. We extend our analysis to include two frequency-dependent propagation effects: (i) multipath scattering, characterized by a pulse-broadening timescale $\tau_\mathrm{sc} \propto \nu^{-4}$, and (ii) residual dispersion, parameterized by $\Delta \mathrm{DM}\propto \nu^{-2}$. Our analysis shows that scattering preserves the inverse relation between sub-burst slope and duration, but increases the scaling coefficient when $\tau_\mathrm{sc}$ exceeds the intrinsic width ($t_\mathrm{w}$) of sub-bursts. Residual DM errors act asymmetrically: under-dedispersion flattens the sub-burst slope, whereas over-dedispersion causes a non-linear increase and eventually a change of sign. When both effects are present, scattering counterbalances the steepening induced by over-dedispersion and augments the flattening produced by under-dedispersion, yielding characteristically distorted curves. We repeat measurements for ultra-short duration bursts (ultra-FRBs) with $t_\mathrm{w} = 50\ \mu\mathrm{s}$ at 1 GHz and found them to be far more sensitive to propagation errors. Deviations become measurable for $\left | \Delta \mathrm{DM} \right |\sim0.05$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and for $\tau_\mathrm{sc} \sim0.1$ ms at 1 GHz, levels that have negligible impact on the standard-width sub-bursts. Our analysis provides practical diagnostics to disentangle propagation effects from the observed spectro-temporal properties of FRBs, thereby recovering true correlations among their intrinsic parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI Spectroscopy of HETDEX Emission-line Candidates I: Line Discrimination Validation</a><span class="id">[2503.02229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hobby-Eberly Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) is an untargeted spectroscopic galaxy survey that uses Ly$\alpha$ emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers of 1.9 &lt; z &lt; 3.5 large scale structure.

By applying a suite of complementary time-series analysis techniques, we identify periodic signatures at approximately 255 and 112 days. These techniques include the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), REDFIT, Date-Compensated Discrete Fourier Transform (DCDFT), Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM), and the String-length method. The reliability of these signals is supported by high local significance (&gt; 99) in all methods and reinforced through phase-folding. Model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly supports a two-component periodic model. The detection of dual QPOs is rare among blazars and suggests complex variability mechanisms. Although a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) scenario could be considered given the sources high redshift (z = 1.837), the short periodicities are difficult to reconcile with orbital motion unless invoking extreme parameters. Double-sine model fitting reveals that the oscillatory components have comparable amplitudes but are out of phase, suggesting a potential beating phenomenon due to interference. This amplitude-modulated variability is consistent with a geometric origin, most plausibly jet precession driven by Lense-Thirring torques, superimposed with a secondary process such as polar jet oscillation. Doppler factor modulation arising from these effects can account for the observed flux variations without requiring an unrealistically compact binary.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effects of continuum fitting on Lyman-$α$ forest correlations</a><span class="id">[2506.15262]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Correlations of fluctuations of the flux in Lyman-$\alpha$ forests of high-redshift quasars have been observed by the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation Spectroscopy Survey (BOSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopy Instrument (DESI) survey where they have revealed the effects of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO).

If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? “New physics” beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09141" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: Scalar versus pseudoscalar cases</a><span class="id">[2508.09141]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star.

We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons.

A665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ($\mathcal{M}\sim$3), and it provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how the energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and nonthermal particle populations. Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant collisionless model, where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front; and (2) a collisional model, where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed-equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0 \pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yr. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($\mathcal{M} = 2.8 \pm 0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large-scale structure formation, and cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09829" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamically New Comet C/2025 D1 (Groeller) with Record Perihelion Distance</a><span class="id">[2509.09829]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We studied C/2025 D1 (Groeller), a long-period comet with an unprecedented perihelion distance of 14.1 au, using archival observations. The data reveals that it had been active at inbound heliocentric distances $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 20$ au. Initially, the comet intrinsically brightened at $r_{\rm H} \gtrsim 16$ au, with brightening parameters comparable to those of other long-period comets. However, observations after late 2023 showed a gradual decay, despite the inbound trajectory of the comet. To our knowledge, such behaviours have not been observed for other long-period comets at similar heliocentric distances. We speculate that this might be linked to the onset of CO$_{2}$ sublimation and/or crystallisation processes. Alternatively, the activity source might have been exhausted. The surface brightness profile of the coma indicates a steady-state mass loss, implying supervolatile sublimation as the primary driver of the observed activity. Despite changes in the orbital plane angle, the circularly symmetric coma persisted throughout the observed period, indicative of the dominance of large grains in the coma. Assuming the activity trend is independent of bandpass, we found that comet was redder than many other solar system comets. Our model-dependent constraint estimates the nucleus radius to be $\gtrsim\!0.4$ km. We performed astrometric measurements, refined the orbital solution, and derived the original and future orbits of the comet. Our N-body integration, accounting for the Galactic tide, strongly favours that the comet is dynamically new, with its previous perihelion at $\gtrsim\!60$ au from the Sun $\gtrsim\!6$ Myr ago. It is highly likely that the comet will be lost from our solar system after the current apparition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of a gap in the envelope mass fraction of sub-Saturns</a><span class="id">[2509.12120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Under the core-accretion model, gas giants form via runaway accretion. This process starts when the mass of the accreted envelope becomes equal to the mass of the core. Here, we model a population of warm sub-Saturns to search for imprints of their formation history in their internal structure. Using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI), we calculate a grid of interior structure models on which we perform retrievals for our sample of 28 sub-Saturns to derive their envelope mass fractions ($f_{env}$). For each planet, we run three different retrievals assuming low (-2.0 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 0.5), medium ( 0.5 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.4), and high (1.4 &lt; log(Fe/H) &lt; 1.7) atmospheric metallicity. The distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample is then compared to predictions of planet formation models. When compared to the outcomes of a planetesimal accretion model, we find that we require medium to high atmospheric metallicities to reproduce the simulated planet population. Additionally, we find a bimodal distribution of $f_{env}$ in our sample with a gap that is located at different values of $f_{env}$ for different atmospheric metallicities. For the high atmospheric metallicity case, the gap in the $f_{env}$ distribution is located between 0.5 and 0.7, which is consistent with assumptions by the core-accretion model where runaway accretion starts when $M_{env} \approx M_{core}$ ($f_{env} \sim 0.5$). We also find a bimodal distribution of the hydrogen and helium mass fraction ($f_{H/He}$) with a gap at $f_{H/He} = 0.3$. The location of this gap is independent of the assumed atmospheric metallicity. Lastly, we compare the distributions of our sub-Saturns in the Neptunian savanna to a population of sub-Saturns in the Neptune desert and ridge. We find that the observed $f_{env}$ distribution of savanna and ridge sub-Saturns is consistent with the planets coming from the same underlying population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">97.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetar-like flares behind the high-energy emission in LS 5039</a><span class="id">[2509.19173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LS 5039 hosts a high-mass star, and a compact object that might be a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS). This scenario requires a mechanism to power its persistent and strong non-thermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which the non-steady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can regularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling the source non-thermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can recurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose growth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To illustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction structure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along the orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS relevant for the non-thermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches the magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind structure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection. However, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the termination shock propagates back towards the magnetosphere, resuming the process. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows, intensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure produced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a quasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS magnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough to explain the non-thermal emission of LS 5039. A magnetospheric multipolar magnetic field much stronger than the dipolar one may provide the required energetics, and help to explain the lack of evidence of a recent supernova remnant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">98.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios</a><span class="id">[2510.00234]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed frameworks: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedman equations and the Tsallis holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario, considering both the Hubble scale and the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff as infrared regulators. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation recovered for $\delta = 1$. While previous studies have suggested that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically requiring $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$, here we go further and perform a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history. We show that even mild departures from $\delta = 1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density can become negative or complex, its equation of state may diverge, or it can contribute an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB constraints. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical interpretation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with the expansion rate toward the past. We conclude that within both the Cai-Kim and HDE formulations, a viable cosmology emerges only in the extensive limit, effectively reducing the models to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings emphasize the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests, when assessing nonextensive entropy formalisms as potential frameworks for describing the Universe's dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluorescent Fe K line emission of gamma Cas stars II. Predictions for magnetic interactions and white-dwarf accretion scenarios</a><span class="id">[2510.03026]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars, exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion, a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad, reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is   40 eV for the magnetic star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Is CPL dark energy a mirage?</a><span class="id">[2510.04191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) raise doubts about the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a preference for an inherently dynamical dark energy component. The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization – a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state – displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parameterizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">101.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08875" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the interacting holographic dark energy models: implications from background and perturbations data</a><span class="id">[2510.08875]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we employ a two-step method to analyze models of holographic dark energy (HDE) and interacting holographic dark energy (IHDE), incorporating three distinct dark energy (DE)-dark matter (DM) interaction terms. First, using the latest background dataset, we conduct a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis to constrain the free parameters of the models. Then, we assess the models against each other using the key background parameters and compare them to the $\Lambda$CDM standard model. Our results show that at high redshifts, the equation of state (EoS) parameter related to the models for both homogeneous and clustered DE cases falls within the quintessence region. However, as we approach the present time, all models except HDE transition into the phantom region, and two models cross the phantom line earlier than others. In the next step, we focus on the evolution of perturbations in DE and DM. Using background and growth rate data, we constrain parameters including $\sigma_8$. We then investigate the evolution of the growth rate of matter perturbations, $f\sigma_8(z)$, and its deviation, $\Delta f \sigma_8$, from the $\Lambda$CDM model. The HDE model shows the best agreement with observational data, while other models predict varying growth rates compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we demonstrate through Akaike and Bayesian information criteria (AIC and BIC) analysis that the compatibility of models with observational data depends on the type of data used, the DE-DM interaction term, and the assumptions regarding DE homogeneity and clustering. Our results suggest that homogeneous DE models yield more agreement with observational data than clustered DE models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">102.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polarization from Rapidly Rotating Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2510.12500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar rotation has long been recognized as important to the evolution of stars, by virtue of the chemical mixing it can induce and how it interacts with binary mass transfer. Binary interaction and rapid rotation are both common in massive stars and involve processes of angular momentum distribution and transport. An important question is how this angular momentum transport leads to the creation of two important classes of rapidly rotating massive stars, Be stars defined by disklike emission lines, and Bn stars defined by rotationally broadened absorption lines. A related question is what limits this rotation places on how conservative the mass transfer can be. Central to addressing these issues is knowledge of how close to rotational break-up stars can get before they produce a disk. Here we calculate diagnostics of this rotational criticality using the continuum polarization arising from a combination of rotational stellar distortion (i.e., oblateness) and redistribution of stellar flux (i.e., gravity darkening), and compare polarizations produced in the von Zeipel approximation with the approach of Espinosa Lara &amp; Rieutord (ELR). Both produce similar photospheric polarizations that rise significantly in the far ultraviolet (FUV) for B stars, with a stronger signal in the von Zeipel case. For early main-sequence and subgiant stars, it reaches a maximum of  1% at 140 nm for stars rotating at 98% of critical, when seen edge-on. Rotational rates above 80% critical result in polarizations of several tenths of a percent, at high inclination. These predicted stable signal strengths indicate that determinations of near-critical rotations in B stars could be achieved with future spectropolarimetric instrumentation that can reach deep into the FUV, such as CASSTOR, the Polstar mission concept, or the POLLUX detector design.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">103.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14173" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radiation pressure and equation of state are important in the envelope unbinding process in common envelope evolution</a><span class="id">[2510.14173]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In common envelope evolution, the ultimate unbinding of the envelope during the plunge-in phase involves complex and poorly understood physical processes that may give rise to luminous red novae. In this work, we investigate the roles of radiation and gas pressures in envelope unbinding. We perform a parameter space survey using a one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic model that is solved by {\tt Guangqi} to study the impact of key parameters on the mass unbound fraction and resulting light curves. The parameters include the radiation to gas energy ratio $\mathcal{E}/e_{\text{g}}\in[0.2,3.2]$, speed of the ejecta, ranging from 70\% to 85\% of the escape velocity, and equation of state (EoS). For comparison, we also perform simulations with pure hydrodynamic or no radiation pressure effect conditions. Our simulations demonstrate that the radiation pressure is crucial for the envelope unbinding. Specifically, the radiation pressure may dominate in a high opacity and high luminosity layer just below the recombination front, where it can accelerate the sub-escape material to escape velocities. A realistic EoS further enhances the pressure gradient, especially during the early phase of ejection at small radii, promoting additional envelope ejection. Both $\mathcal{E}/e_{\text{g}}$ and EoS significantly alter light curve shapes, and provide observable diagnostics for these processes. We show that the relative energy error of all the simulations is no more than 1.4\%, and all the simulations are close to convergence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">104.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15723" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Find: Discovery and chemo-dynamical properties of two s-process enhanced RR Lyrae stars</a><span class="id">[2510.15723]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the serendipitous discovery of two RR Lyrae stars exhibiting significant s-process element enrichment, a rare class previously represented solely by TY Gruis.

We also employed Gaia DR3 astrometric data to analyse their kinematics, orbital properties, and classify their Galactic population membership. We compared observational results with theoretical asymptotic giant branch nucleosynthesis models to interpret their enrichment patterns. Both stars exhibit clear signatures of s-process enrichment, with significant overabundances in second-peak elements such as Ba and La compared to first-peak Y and Zr. Comparison with AGB nucleosynthesis models suggests their progenitors experienced pollution of s-process-rich material, consistent with early binary interactions. However, notable discrepancies in dilution factors highlight the need for more refined low-metallicity asymptotic giant branch (AGB) models. We also explore and discuss alternative scenarios, including sub-luminous post-AGB-like evolution or double episodes of mass transfer. Our findings confirm the existence of s-process-enhanced RR Lyrae stars and demonstrate the importance of combining chemical and dynamical diagnostics to unveil their complex evolutionary pathways.

We examine the case where the customary assumption of a strictly positive effective DE density may not apply, offering new possibilities. Focusing on $f(T) = T e^{T_*/T}$, we investigate cosmological solutions parametrized by the parameter $\beta = T_*/T_0$. This parameter uniquely determines $\Omega_{\rm m0}$, and its sign plays a crucial role in characterizing deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM. We elaborate on the structural asymmetry between the positive- and negative-$\beta$ branches: while the $\beta_{+}$ leads to dynamics with modest departures from $\Lambda$CDM, the $\beta_{-}$ yields more pronounced and nontrivial deviations. Despite these deviations, the negative-$\beta$ branch can remain consistent with local gravity constraints through an effective chameleon-like mechanism. We also examine the model in the context of dynamical DE. Ensuring consistency with CMB data, the widely studied $\beta_{+}$ exhibits phantom behavior, while the previously overlooked $\beta_{-}$ features a sign-changing DE density that transitions smoothly from negative to positive values at $z_{\dagger} \sim 1.5$. Though the sign-changing DE leads to a larger-than-expected enhancement, we extend the analysis by incorporating $\Lambda$. This extension broadens the solution space consistent with the SH0ES measurement while maintaining consistency with CMB. Additionally, it introduces richer phenomenological possibilities, including the potential moderation or cessation of cosmic acceleration at very low redshifts, aligning with recent observational analyses, such as those from DESI BAO data.

As the Higgs self-coupling runs toward negative values at high energy scales, a non-minimal interaction with curvature during a stiff background expansion era drives the Higgs fluctuations closer to the instability scale. This curvature-induced tachyonic instability leads to an intense production of Higgs particles, accompanied by a stochastic gravitational-wave background. The characteristic features of such signal can be directly correlated to the inflationary scale, the non-minimal coupling parameter and the top quark Yukawa coupling. We distinguish between three possible scenarios: absolute stability with low top quark masses, potential vacuum instability, and absolute stability with new physics above the instability scale. Our findings suggest that the detection of a peaked background of gravitational waves together with its inflationary tail has the potential to unveil the features of the Higgs effective potential at very high energy scales while providing a minimal explanation for the reheating phase and the emergence of the Standard-Model plasma in the early Universe.

Since the initial value of the axion is larger than its quantum fluctuations, such a condition imposes a lower bound on the axion dacay constant, which sets an upper bound on the amplitude of the energy spectrum of GWs. As a result, the amplitude of the predicted GW energy spectrum is lower than $10^{-10}$ in the nHz to mHz frequency range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">115.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postsphaleron darkogenesis</a><span class="id">[2507.03747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A supercooled phase transition in a nearly conformal dark sector can provide a natural setting for darkogenesis via its out-of-equilibrium dynamics, where a particle-antiparticle number asymmetry in the dark sector can be reprocessed into the visible sector, yielding the observed baryon asymmetry and an asymmetric dark matter. We consider a scenario where the number asymmetry is generated from the decay of a mother particle produced via parametric resonance during the phase transition induced due to its coupling to the dilaton associated with spontaneous breaking of scale invariance. It is shown that the correct baryon asymmetry and dark matter abundance can be realized for a dark phase transition at $\mathcal{O}(1) \, \rm GeV$, which can also explain the nano-Hz gravitational wave signal reported by pulsar timing array experiments. The scenario will be tested further in neutron-antineutron oscillation experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">116.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05136" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recasting Experimental Constraints on Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles</a><span class="id">[2507.05136]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetic monopoles with masses up to $10^{14}$ GeV can be accelerated to relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments, with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein, to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">117.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07786" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on axionlike particles from 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data and prospects for VLAST</a><span class="id">[2507.07786]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axionlike particles (ALPs), hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model, are considered as promising dark matter candidates. ALPs can convert into photons and vice versa in a magnetic field via the Primakoff effect, potentially generating detectable oscillation in $\gamma$-ray spectra. This study analyzes 16.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) on NGC 1275, the brightest galaxy in the Perseus cluster, to constrain the ALP parameter space. Our results improve the previous 95\% exclusion limits of the photon-ALP coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ by a factor of 2 in the ALP mass range of $4\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Moreover, we investigate the projected sensitivity of the future Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) on searching for ALPs. We find that (i) the expected sensitivity on the ALP-photon coupling can be stronger than that from the upcoming International Axion Observatory (IAXO) in the ALP mass range of $2\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 1\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the best sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 7\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ at $m_{a}\sim 2\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}$; (ii) VLAST can extend the sensitivity of the ALP masses below $5\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$, where the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 1.5\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ will be excluded; (iii) the entire parameter space of ALP accounting for TeV transparency can be fully tested. These results demonstrate that VLAST will offer an excellent opportunity for ALPs searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">118.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials</a><span class="id">[2507.20484]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion–dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons – localized, oscillating axion field configurations – naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter.

Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">120.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17363" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong Gravity Effects on $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected Single Scalar Field Inflation and Compatibility with the ACT Data</a><span class="id">[2508.17363]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work we introduce the rescaled $\mathcal{R}^2$-corrected minimally coupled scalar field theory, a theory that contains minimal quantum corrections of the single scalar field Lagrangian. We develop the theoretical framework in the string frame where the baryons geodesics are free fall geodesics and we do not treat the theory as a two scalar field theory in the Einstein frame. The theoretical framework can be reduced to a single scalar field theory framework by using a perturbative expansion at the level of the field equations, making the resulting theory easy to tackle analytically. The first two quantum corrections contain two terms, a linear $\sim \mathcal{R}$ and a quadratic term $\sim \mathcal{R}^2$. The effect of the linear term alters the Einstein-Hilbert term, making the resulting theory a rescaled version of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Due to the presence of the rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim \lambda \frac{\mathcal{R}}{16\pi G}$, the gravitational constant will no longer be that of Newton's, but a rescaled one $\frac{G}{\lambda}$ and hence gravity can be stronger primordially, or even weaker. The perspective of having stronger gravity primordially, is compatible with intuition, since one expects a stronger gravity primordially, but having a weaker gravity for some reason is not prohibited theoretically. The attribute of our theoretical framework is that it allows a stronger gravity primordially, which returns to ordinary gravity as the curvature of the Universe decreases. We examine the effects of the quantum terms on several mainstream scalar field inflationary potentials, such as hybrid inflation, monomial inflation and power-law inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">121.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01311" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boltzmann Suppressed Ultraviolet Freeze-in</a><span class="id">[2510.01311]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>If the dark matter mass $m$ exceeds the maximum temperature of the Universe ($T_{\rm max} &lt; m$), then its production rate will be Boltzmann suppressed. The important implications of this Boltzmann suppression have been explored for dark matter freeze-in via renormalizable operators. Here we extend these considerations to the case of ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in for which freeze-in proceeds via non-renormalizable operators. The UV freeze-in variant has a number of appealing features, not least that a given effective field theory can describe a multitude of UV completions, and thus such analyses are model agnostic for a given high dimension freeze-in operator. We undertake model independent analyses of UV freeze-in for portal operators of general mass dimensions. Subsequently, we explore a number of specific examples, namely, Higgs portals, bino dark matter, and gravitino dark matter. Finally, we discuss how significant differences arise if one departs from the standard assumptions regarding inflationary reheating (i.e. transitions from an early matter dominated era to radiation domination). As a motivated example we examine the implications of early kination domination. Boltzmann suppressed UV freeze-in is well motivated and permits a number of compelling scenarios. In particular, we highlight that for $T_{\rm max} \sim$ 1 TeV it is feasible that the freeze-in mechanism is entirely realized within a couple of orders of magnitude of the TeV scale, making it experimentally accessible in contrast to traditional freeze-in scenarios.</p></div></details></article></body>
