VI. Unraveling the Dual Impact of Bars on Star Formation in Paired Galaxies Using DESI</a><span class="id">[2510.18937]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive investigation into the influence of stellar bars on star formation (SF) in galaxy pairs, using a large sample of low-redshift galaxies ($0.02$ $&lt;$ z $&lt;$ $0.08$) from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys DR8. Our analysis examines whether bars enhance or suppress SF during pair interactions, and how these outcomes depend on the star-forming properties of companion galaxies. We find that bars either catalyze or inhibit SF in their host galaxies, depending on the companion's SF activity. In particular, barred galaxies paired with actively star-forming companions experience more pronounced central starbursts (with sSFR up to $\sim$ 2.5 dex higher) than unbarred counterparts, whereas those with passive companions often have suppressed SF (sometimes below isolated galaxy levels). The notion of the dual role of bars can reconcile conventional conflicting reports of bar-driven enhancement versus quenching of SF activity. Bars, well known to regulate kpc-scale dynamics, may also link to the impact of external environments: when a star-forming companion provides sufficient gas, bars drive central starbursts, whereas in gas-poor interactions, bars hasten gas depletion and contribute to SF suppression. This work highlights the necessity of accounting for both internal structure and companion properties to fully understand SF regulation in interacting galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18942" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warped Disk Galaxies. II. From the Cosmic Web to the Galactic Warp</a><span class="id">[2510.18942]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galactic warps are common in disk galaxies. While often attributed to galaxy–galaxy tides, a non-spherical dark matter (DM) halo has also been proposed as a driver of disk warping. We investigate links among warp morphology, satellite distribution, and large-scale structure using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog of warped disks compiled by Zee et al.\ (2022). Warps are classified into 244 S and 127 U types, hosting 1,373 and 740 satellites, respectively, and are compared to an unwarped control matched in stellar mass, redshift, and local density. As an indirect, population-level proxy for the host halo's shape and orientation, we analyze the stacked spatial distribution of satellites. Warped hosts show a significant anisotropy: an excess at $45^{\circ}&lt;\phi&lt;90^{\circ}$ (measured from the host major axis), peaking at $P(\phi)\simeq 0.003$, versus nearly isotropic controls. Satellites of S-type warps preferentially align with the nearest cosmic filament, whereas those of U-type warps are more often perpendicular. The incidence of warps increases toward filaments ($r_{\rm fil}&lt;4,{\rm Mpc},h^{-1}$), while the number of satellites around warped hosts remains approximately constant with filament distance, indicating a direct influence of the large-scale environment. We discuss possible links between galactic warps and the cosmic web, including anisotropic tidal fields and differences in evolutionary stage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The THESAN project: Lyman-alpha emitters as probes of ionized bubble sizes</a><span class="id">[2510.18946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the THESAN radiation-hydrodynamics simulations to investigate how Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) trace ionized bubble sizes during the Epoch of Reionization. We generate realistic LAE catalogs by combining accurate intrinsic Ly$\alpha$ production and intergalactic transmission with an empirical model for dust absorption and gas outflows. By calibrating to observationally-constrained Ly$\alpha$ luminosity functions, we reproduce the rapid decline in Ly$\alpha$ visibility toward higher redshifts while revealing mild tensions in LAE fractions near the end of reionization. Before the midpoint of reionization, galaxies within larger line-of-sight bubbles ($\gtrsim 10$ cMpc) have higher observed Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width (EW), demonstrating that the evolving LAE fraction provides a practical statistical tracer for bubble size. These correlations weaken as percolation progresses and the IGM becomes increasingly ionized. In LAE selected samples with $L_{\text{Ly}\alpha} &gt; 10^{41.5}\ \text{erg s}^{-1}$, Ly$\alpha$ properties correlate with bubble size more strongly than UV magnitude, especially at $z \gtrsim 7$. This simulation-based framework maps LAE selections to bubble-size statistics, clarifies biases in more idealized models, and will supply public catalogs to interpret current and forthcoming JWST and narrow-band LAE surveys in terms of the evolving topology of reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS) X: Molecular gas clumpiness under the influence of AGN</a><span class="id">[2510.18957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The distribution of molecular gas on small scales regulates star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes in galaxy centers, yet the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in shaping this distribution remains poorly constrained. We investigate how AGN influence the small-scale structure of molecular gas in galaxy centers, by measuring the clumpiness of CO(3 - 2) emission observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in the nuclear regions (50 - 200 pc from the AGN) of 16 nearby Seyfert galaxies from the Galaxy Activity, Torus, and Outflow Survey (GATOS). To quantify clumpiness, we apply three different methods: (1) the median of the pixel-by-pixel contrast between the original and smoothed maps; (2) the ratio of the total excess flux to the total flux, after substracting the background smoothed emission; and (3) the fraction of total flux coming from clumpy regions, interpreted as the mass fraction in clumps. We find a negative correlation between molecular gas clumpiness and AGN X-ray luminosity (L_X), suggesting that higher AGN activity is associated with smoother gas distributions. All methods reveal a turnover in this relation around L_X = 10^{42} erg/s, possibly indicating a threshold above which AGN feedback becomes efficient at dispersing dense molecular structures and suppressing future star formation. Our findings provide new observational evidence that AGN feedback can smooth out dense gas structures in galaxy centers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter profiles of &quot;in silico&quot; galaxies: deep learning inference</a><span class="id">[2510.18964]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Machine learning has the potential to improve the reconstruction of the dark matter profile of galaxies with respect to traditional methods, like rotation curves. We demonstrate on the simulation suite Illustris-TNG that a steerable equivariant convolutional neural network (CNN) is able to infer the dark matter profiles within and around individual galaxies from photometric and interferometric data, improving on a standard CNN. Within the in silico environment of the simulations, our architecture is able to capture the dark matter distribution within galaxies without a parametrization of the profile. We perform an interpretability analysis to understand the internal mechanisms of the trained model and the most important data features used to estimate the dark matter profiles. The equivariant CNN recovers the dark matter profile of galaxies within the stellar mass range $[10^{10} - 10^{12} ]$ $M_{\odot}$ with excellent precision and accuracy: the mean squared error is reduced by a factor of   3 from its value under the training distribution, demonstrating that the network has learnt from the data features. While this holds within the controlled 'in silico' environment of the simulation, we argue that few additional steps are needed before this method can be reliably applied to galaxies in the real field observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18965" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intermediate-Mass Stripped Stars in the Magellanic Clouds: Forward Modeling the Observed Population Discovered Via UV Excess</a><span class="id">[2510.18965]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stripped stars are hot, helium-rich stars formed when binary interactions remove a star's hydrogen envelope. While low-mass ($\lesssim 1\,M_\odot$) and high-mass ($\gtrsim 8\,M_\odot$) stripped stars are well studied as hot subdwarfs and Wolf-Rayet stars, their intermediate-mass counterparts ($1-8 \,M_\odot$) have only recently been discovered. The Stripped-Star Ultraviolet Magellanic Cloud Survey (SUMS) identified UV-excess sources in the Magellanic Clouds using Swift-UVOT photometry and selected 820 photometric stripped-star candidates. However, the selection function, completeness, and purity of this sample remain poorly understood. We forward model the population of stripped stars in the Magellanic Clouds using a binary population synthesis model combined with spatially resolved star formation histories and simulated UV photometry. To assess survey sensitivity, we inject simulated sources into real Swift-UVOT images and reproduce the SUMS selection process, including crowding, extinction, and photometric quality cuts. We recover $\sim 250$ simulated stripped stars with masses $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$, which corresponds to a recover rate of $9-13\,\%$. The rest are missed due to dilution by luminous companions, crowding, and high extinction. The observed population is biased toward systems with low-mass companions formed by common envelope evolution and toward systems with compact object companions. Of the stripped stars which show UV excess, $25-45\,\%$ are identifiable by SUMS; higher-resolution data or improved reddening corrections are needed to detect the rest. We predict contamination of the observed stripped star candidates by main-sequence stars with spurious UV excess due to crowding and provide guidelines for selecting higher-purity subsamples. These results enable tests of binary evolution models and realistic comparison of observed and simulated stripped-star populations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accreted stars and stellar haloes of simulated galaxies in TNG50</a><span class="id">[2510.18971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use the TNG50 cosmological hydrodynamic simulation to study the accreted stellar component and stellar haloes of isolated galaxies spanning a wide range of masses ($10^8&lt;M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^{11}$). We find that stars formed in the main progenitor (i.e., in-situ stars) typically dominate the inner regions as far as $\sim$10 half-light radii from the centre, implying that detecting uncontrovertible evidence for the presence of an accreted stellar halo requires probing the far outskirts of a galaxy. Stars from accreted, disrupted satellites (i.e., ex-situ stars) dominate beyond that radius (roughly $25\%$ of the virial radius, $r_{200}$), which we identify as the inner boundary of the outer stellar halo. The fraction of accreted stars decreases monotonically with decreasing galaxy mass, $M_*$, from $\sim$$20\%$ on average in $\sim$$2\times 10^{12}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{11}\, M_\odot$) to $2$-$3\%$ in $\sim$$2\times 10^{10}\, M_\odot$ haloes ($M_*\sim$$10^{8}\, M_\odot$). The outer halo has a mass comparable to roughly $10\%$ of all accreted stars. Fewer than $\sim$$30\%$ of stars in the outer halo are in-situ stars, many of which originate from star-forming satellites during the late stages of disruption, especially in low-mass systems. Accreted stars are systematically more metal poor in less massive systems, which makes the outer haloes of dwarf galaxies a fertile hunting ground for extremely metal-poor stars. At given galaxy mass, the more massive stellar haloes are systematically more concentrated (smaller $R_{\rm eff}$) and have steeper density profiles (larger $n$). Our results provide a blueprint for interpreting observations of the outskirts of isolated galaxies in terms of their assembly histories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving the Nuclear Environments of Tidal Disruption Event Host Galaxies within 45 pc</a><span class="id">[2510.18985]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using HST/STIS observations, we present the highest-spatial-resolution spectroscopic study to date of four tidal disruption event (TDE) host galaxies, with the best observed being the post-starburst (PSB) host of ASASSN-14li. The stellar population of ASASSN-14li's host, within 44 pc of the nucleus, reveals a younger recent starburst ($\sim$340 Myr) compared to the population at an offset radius of 88 pc that excludes the nucleus ($\sim$550 Myr), a radial age gradient suggesting gas inflows from a minor merger. We estimate a stellar density of $\sim5900 \pm 800 \, M_\odot / \mathrm{pc}^3$ within 30 pc of the nucleus of ASASSN-14li's host, exceeding densities expected for nuclear star clusters. High-ionization “coronal&quot; emission lines, [Fe VI] $\lambda 5677$, [Fe VII] $\lambda 6087$, and [Fe X] $\lambda 6375$, are also detected within the nuclear spectra of the hosts of ASASSN-14li and PTF09ge, importantly alongside the non-detection of [O III] at the same scale. We similarly do not detect [O III] in the nuclear region of ASASSN-14ae's host despite its presence in the SDSS spectrum. The different ionization radiation levels detected at various radii from TDE host nuclei may indicate echoes of earlier accretion episodes, including, potentially, a prior TDE. We posit that a minor merger driving gas inflow to the nucleus could drive the enhanced TDE rates in post-starburst galaxies, inducing variation in nuclear gas properties and star formation history on $&lt;$150 pc scales in TDE hosts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19016" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Optical Colors of Galactic Cirrus Clouds in the Stripe 82 Region</a><span class="id">[2510.19016]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations have shown that the optical colors of Galactic cirrus clouds differ significantly from those of extragalactic sources; thus, they can be used to distinguish Galactic cirrus from extragalactic low surface brightness (LSB) features. To understand these properties, we calculate radiative transfer models in dust clouds, where photons are incident from the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). Dust clouds are modeled to mimic a turbulent medium using a fractional Brownian motion algorithm, resulting in a lognormal density distribution and a power-law power spectral density that are appropriate for the ISM. The results are compared with optical observations of cirrus clouds in the Stripe 82 region. The observed color–color ($g-r$, $r-i$, and $i-z$) diagrams of the cirrus clouds can be reproduced by scattered light if the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) of Mathis et al. (as updated by Draine) is modified, either by reducing the intensities in the $i$ and $z$ bands or by enhancing those in the $g$ and $r$ bands. Similar results can also be obtained by adjusting the scattering albedos at the corresponding wavelengths. This demonstrates that the color–color diagrams are effective not only for identifying extragalactic LSB features but also for studying the ISRF and the properties of interstellar dust.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The slope and scatter of the star forming main sequence at z 5 : reconciling observations with simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.19044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxies exhibit a tight correlation between their star-formation rate and stellar mass over a wide redshift range known as the star-forming main sequence (SFMS). With JWST, we can now investigate the SFMS at high redshifts down to masses of $\sim10^6$ M$_{\odot}$, using sensitive star-formation rate tracers such as H$\alpha$ emission – which allow us to probe the variability in star formation histories. We present inferences of the SFMS based on 316 H$\alpha$-selected galaxies at $z\sim4$-$5$ with $\log(\rm M_\star/M_\odot) = 6.4$ -$10.6$. These galaxies were identified behind the Abell 2744 lensing cluster with NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the “All the Little Things” (ALT) survey. At face value, our data suggest a shallow slope of the SFMS (SFR $\propto \mathrm{M}_\star^\alpha$, with $\alpha=0.45$). After correcting for the H$\alpha$-flux limited nature of our survey using a Bayesian framework, the slope steepens to $\alpha = 0.59^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$, whereas current data on their own are inconclusive on the mass dependence of the scatter. These slopes differ significantly from the slope of $\approx1$ expected from the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and from simulations. When fixing the slope to $\alpha=1$, we find evidence for a decreasing intrinsic scatter with stellar mass (from $\approx 0.5$ dex at M$_\star=10^8$ M$_\odot$ to $0.4$ dex at M$_\star=10^{10}$ M$_\odot$). This tension might be explained by a (combination of) luminosity-dependent SFR(H$\alpha$) calibration, a population of (mini)-quenched low-mass galaxies, or underestimated dust attenuation in high-mass galaxies. Future deep observations across facilities can quantify these processes, enabling better insights into the variability of star formation histories.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dynamics of S-stars and G-sources orbiting a supermassive compact object made of fermionic dark matter</a><span class="id">[2510.19087]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Surrounding Sgr A*, a cluster of young and massive stars coexist with a population of dust-enshrouded objects, whose astrometric data can be used to scrutinize the nature of Sgr A*. An alternative to the black hole (BH) scenario has been recently proposed in terms of a supermassive compact object composed of self-gravitating fermionic dark matter (DM). Such horizon-less configurations can reproduce the relativistic effects measured for S2 orbit, while being part of a single continuous configuration whose extended halo reproduces the latest GAIA-DR3 rotation curve. In this work, we statistically compare different fermionic DM configurations aimed to fit the astrometric data of S2, and five G-sources, and compare with the BH potential when appropriate. We sample the parameter spaces via Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics and perform a quantitative comparison estimating Bayes factors for models that share the same likelihood function. We extend previous results of the S2 and G2 orbital fits for 56 keV fermions (low core-compactness) and show the results for 300 keV fermions (high core-compactness). For the selected S2 dataset, the former model is slightly favoured over the latter. However, more precise S2 datasets, as obtained by the GRAVITY instrument, remain to be analysed in light of the fermionic models. For the G-objects, no conclusive preference emerges between models. For all stellar objects tested, the BH and fermionic models predict orbital parameters that differ by less than 1%. More accurate data, particularly from stars closer to Sgr A*, is necessary to statistically distinguish between the models considered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the origins, growth, and radiative efficiency of J0529-4351, reportedly the fastest-growing known black hole</a><span class="id">[2510.19258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SMSS J0521-4351 is reportedly the most luminous quasar known to date, and assuming a mean radiative efficiency of 0.1, it is inferred to be the fastest-growing black hole, accreting approximately one solar mass per day. Assessing the implications of this assumption on the seed mass and inception time of J0529-4351, we show that the inferred accretion rate is unreasonably high and that its radiative efficiency must be much greater than 0.1. Then, we derive its accretion rate and seed mass, and for comparison of three other similar-size ( 1-2E+10 solar masses) black holes at various redshifts, using well-tested empirical scaling relations. The results indicate that J0529-4351 grew from a heavy seed ( 2-3E+04 solar masses), and that its accretion rate ( 10-13 solar masses/year) is the lowest of the four black holes. However, its radiative efficiency inferred from its bolometric luminosity and the derived accretion rate is the highest, which explains why it is the most luminous despite having the lowest accretion rate. This study challenges the prevailing notion that a higher luminosity or a higher Eddington ratio implies a higher accretion rate, highlights the dependence of a black hole's luminosity on radiative efficiency, reveals the pitfalls of inferring black hole properties assuming a standard value for radiative efficiency, and suggests that the Eddington ratios of high-luminosity BHs may be significantly overestimated.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling Globular Cluster Counts with Bayesian Latent Models</a><span class="id">[2510.19409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a Bayesian latent model to describe the scaling relation between globular cluster populations and their host galaxies, updating the framework proposed in de Souza 2015.

We identified a core sample of 10 UDGs defined by $\mu_{g,0}\ge24$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.5$ kpc, and a broader sample including 12 additional faint diffuse galaxies ($\mu_{g,0}\ge23.7$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and $R_{e}\ge1.3$ kpc). Within the core sample, we highlight the first discovery of a UDG pair. Their projected separation is just 75 arcsec (22 kpc at 61.9 Mpc), with a central H I velocity difference of 34 km s$^{-1}$. The North-Western UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-1) has a larger H I reservoir, $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.95\pm0.03$, compared to the South-Eastern UDG (WALLABY J104513-262755-UDG-2), $\log_{10}(M_{HI}/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.60\pm0.04$. UDG-1's stellar mass and star formation rate are also approximately an order of magnitude larger at $\log_{10}(M_*/\rm M_{\odot}) = 8.07\pm0.12$ and $\log_{10}(SFR/\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}) = -1.26\pm0.12$ respectively. The pair has an isolated local environment, with no other galaxies or H I sources within 30 arcmin (525 kpc) and $\pm1000$ km s$^{-1}$. However, in the context of the larger-scale structure, the pair is located outside the virial radius of the Hydra cluster, with its position on the phase-space diagram indicating that it is infalling into the cluster. The identification of this H I-bearing UDG pair raises important questions around the formation of such a unique system and the evolution of UDGs in a transitional phase before ram pressure stripping and cluster infall.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XRISM mock observations of simulated AGN jets in the core of a galaxy cluster</a><span class="id">[2510.19500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are expected to heat the surrounding intracluster medium (ICM). We investigate how the interaction between jets and the ICM appears in high-resolution X-ray observations using mock X-ray observations based on two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We constructed a model of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) similar to Cygnus A (Cyg A), a powerful FR II radio galaxy. Our simulations model bipolar jets propagating into a stratified ICM, forming forward shocks and low-density cocoons. Based on these results, we generate synthetic spectra that incorporate both shocked and unshocked ICM components. Then, we perform mock observations using the XRISM/Resolve X-ray spectrometer. We focus particularly on viewing angle effects. Our mock observations revealed that the smallest line broadening, observed as velocity dispersion, associated with the cocoon's bulk expansion occurs when observing along the jet direction, where the expansion velocity is highest. Although this may appear counterintuitive, it occurs because the rapidly expanding jet head contributes little to X-ray emission due to its high temperature and low density. Our results highlight the importance of considering the temperature and density structure of AGN-driven shocks and cocoons when interpreting XRISM data. These findings lay the groundwork for XRISM's observations of AGN jets and will improve our understanding of AGN feedback processes in galaxy clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAUST. XXVIII. High-Resolution ALMA Observations of Class 0/I Disks: Structure, Optical Depths, and Temperatures</a><span class="id">[2510.19635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution ( 7.5 au) ALMA observations at 1.3 and 3 mm of 16 disks around Class 0/I protostars across multiple star-forming regions and a variety of multiplicities, showing a range of disk sizes ( 2-100 au) and including circumbinary disks (CBDs) in binaries with separations &lt;100 au. The disk properties show similarities to Class II disks, including (a) low spectral index (SI) values (alpha=2.1) that increase with disk radius, (b) 3 mm disk sizes only marginally smaller than at 1.3 mm (&lt;10%), and (c) radial intensity profiles well described by modified self-similar profiles. We also find key differences: (i) SI values increasing with radius, but exceeding 2 only at the disk edge (ii) higher brightness temperatures Tb, in some cases higher than the predicted temperatures due to irradiation, and (iii)  10x higher luminosity at a given size compared to the Class II disks. These results confirm significant optical depth in the observed Class 0/I disks, at both 1.3 and 3 mm, helping to explain their higher luminosities, but higher temperatures are also required for the most compact (&lt; 40 au) disks, suggesting additional viscous heating. Considering optical depth, most disk dust masses are estimated in the range 30-900 Mearth (0.01-0.3 Msun in gas), resulting in some disks reaching marginal gravitational instability. The median location of the water iceline is  3 au, but it can extend beyond 10-20 au for the hottest disks. CBDs exhibit lower optical depths at both wavelengths and hence higher SI values (alpha=3.0), dust masses of 100 Mearth, and beta 1.5 (2 Class 0 CBDs) and beta 1 (1 Class I CBD), suggesting substantial grain growth only in the more evolved CBD. The inferred high optical depths provide a compelling explanation for the apparent scarcity of dust substructures in the younger disks at   1 mm, despite mounting evidence for early planet formation (ABRIDGED).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19673" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond single tracers: CNN-based inference of galaxy mass profiles from combined gas and stellar kinematics</a><span class="id">[2510.19673]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether combining gas and stellar kinematic maps provides measurable advantages in recovering galaxy mass profiles, compared to using single-component maps alone.

We develop a probabilistic convolutional neural network (CNN) framework trained and tested on mock galaxy kinematic maps from multiple cosmological simulation suites. Our model is trained on gas-only, stars-only, and combined gas+stellar velocity maps, allowing direct comparison of performance across tracers. To assess robustness, we include simulations with differing feedback models and galaxy properties. Combining gas and stellar maps reduces the dispersion in the inferred mass profiles by up to a factor of $\sim$1.5 compared to models using either tracer independently. The CNN architecture effectively captures complementary information from the two components.

In this framework, two major frontiers emerge: the characterization of collisional processes involving heavy projectiles, and the treatment of ro-vibrational excitation. The significant computational effort of these investigations emphasizes the need to test and develop robust theoretical methods and approximations, capable of extending the census of collisional coefficients required for reliable astrophysical modeling.

These AGN candidates suggest that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow rapidly in the early Universe. In a series of numerical experiments, we investigate how SMBHs grow within and influence the most massive galaxies at Cosmic Dawn using cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES. Our suite of simulations explore how super-Eddington accretion, seed mass, and the strength of feedback influence SMBH-galaxy co-evolution in the early Universe. We find that SMBH growth is sensitive to stellar feedback which generates a turbulent-multiphase interstellar medium (ISM) that stochastically starves the SMBH. In the absence of AGN feedback, we find that the SMBH is starved $\sim 50\%$ of the time after the onset of star formation in the galaxy. SMBH growth can become self-regulated by AGN feedback if the SMBH becomes massive enough, either by accretion or seeding, for its feedback to dominate the surrounding nuclear region. We find no evidence of galaxy-scale, AGN-driven quenching in the star formation rate (SFR) across all simulations in our suite.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic Positrons from Thermonuclear Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2202.05417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from a wide variety of explosion scenarios and progenitor channels.

We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and gamma-rays include both beta + decay of 56 Co and pair production.

For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 1E13 G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SN Ia. We find that this is dominated by normal-bright SNe Ia, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small.

We find the observed tendency towards elongated, prolate-shaped young galaxies is well matched by WDM, from material accreted along smooth filaments during the first $\simeq 500\,\mathrm{Myr}$, with little dependence on stellar mass. This contrasts with CDM, where the stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal, formed from merging of fragmented filaments. For CDM, several subhalos are predicted to be visible, whereas for WDM and $\psi$DM, early merging is rare.

However, the gas phases involved, cold HI and CO-dark molecular gas, are challenging to directly observe and physically characterize. We observed the Cygnus X star-forming complex in carbon radio recombination lines (CRRLs) at 274–399 MHz with the Green Bank Telescope at 48' (21 pc) resolution. Of the 30 deg$^2$ surveyed, we detect line-synthesized C273$\alpha$ emission from 24 deg$^2$ and produce the first large-area maps of low-frequency CRRLs, which likely originate in CO-dark molecular gas. The morphology of the C273$\alpha$ emission reveals arcs, ridges, and extended possibly sheet-like gas which are often on the outskirts of CO emission. We find a correlation between velocity-integrated C273$\alpha$ and the 8 $\mu$m intensity with a power-law slope of $1.3 \pm 0.2$. We interpret the relation as the dependence of cool dark gas emission on the FUV radiation field, $G_0 \approx 40 - 160$. We determine the typical angular separation between C273$\alpha$ and $^{13}$CO emission to be 12 pc. Velocity differences between C273$\alpha$ and $^{13}$CO are apparent throughout the region and have a typical value of 2.9 km s$^{-1}$. We estimate gas densities of $n \approx 20 - 900$ cm$^{-3}$ with a nominal $n \approx 400$ cm$^{-3}$ in the C$^{+}$/H$_2$ layer. The evolution of the C273$\alpha$ gas seems to be dominated by turbulent pressure, with a characteristic timescale to form H$_2$ of about 2.6 Myr. These observations underline the richness of low-frequency CRRLs to provide revelatory insights into the characteristics of (CO-)dark gas and the evolution of molecular gas.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TOPz: Photometric redshifts using template fitting applied to the GAMA survey</a><span class="id">[2503.24039]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Accurate photometric redshift estimation is crucial for cosmological and galaxy evolution studies, especially with the advent of large-scale photometric surveys. Aims. We developed a photo-z estimation code called TOPz (Tartu Observatory Photo-z) and applied it to the GAMA photometric catalogue. Using nine-band photometric data from the GAMA project, we assessed the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z estimates to available spectroscopic redshifts from GAMA and DESI. The latter extends to z &lt; 2 and m_Z &lt; 24, allowing the photo-z accuracy to be validated beyond the GAMA limits. Methods. TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate photo-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. We generated synthetic galaxy spectra using the CIGALE software and ran template set optimisation. We improved the photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections. An analytical prior was then imposed on the resulting posteriors to refine the redshift estimates. Results. The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the spectroscopic redshifts in the low-redshift regime (z &lt; 0.5). We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various magnitude bins and tested how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the actual uncertainty of the estimates. For the GAMA sample, the sigma_NMAD = 0.012 for m_Z &lt;18 and increases to sigma_NMAD = 0.021 for m_Z &gt;19. The outlier fraction (|dz|/(1 + z)&gt;0.1) in the same magnitude bins increases from 1% to 5%. We show that the TOPz results are consistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes (EAZY and SFM) applied to the same data set. Conclusions. TOPz is an advanced photo-z estimation code that integrates flux corrections, physical priors, and template set optimisation to provide state-of-the-art photo-z among competing template-based redshift estimators.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03085" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the X-ray-radio connection for AGN via measurements of the multi-dimensional luminosity function</a><span class="id">[2507.03085]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present new methods to quantify the AGN population in terms of a multi-dimensional luminosity function that describes the space density of sources as a function of both X-ray and radio luminosity. We compile a sample of 1538 radio and X-ray detected extragalactic sources from the Boötes and COSMOS fields. First, we investigate the X-ray-radio luminosity correlation in the sample and find that an apparent correlation is introduced due to the sensitivity limits of the surveys; when considering individual redshift bins we find a wide range of radio luminosities associated with a given X-ray luminosity, and vice versa, indicating little direct connection between the emission processes. We then measure the X-ray luminosity function, radio luminosity function and multi-dimensional X-ray-radio luminosity function across redshift ($0&lt;z&lt;6$). We apply luminosity thresholds in X-ray and radio to restrict our sample to those in the AGN-dominated regime and explore how the fraction of radio-selected AGN within the overall X-ray sample varies with increasing X-ray luminosity (and vice versa). We find that towards the highest X-ray and radio luminosities the fraction of sources with both an X-ray and radio detection increases towards 100%, indicating that at the highest luminosities we are more likely to obtain a detection in both bands, though the source will not necessarily be bright in both bands. Thus, the most luminous accretion events are more likely to be associated with the production of a jet, despite the distinct physical structures that produce the emission and likely persist over very different timescales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Effects of Linear Matter Power Spectrum Enhancement on Dark Matter Substructure</a><span class="id">[2507.16889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present cosmological dark matter (DM)–only zoom-in simulations of a Milky Way analog originating from enhanced linear matter power spectra $P(k)$ relative to the standard cold, collisionless DM (CDM) cosmology. We consider a Gaussian power excess in $P(k)$ followed by a cutoff in select cases; this behavior could arise from early-Universe physics that alters the primordial matter power spectrum or DM physics in the radiation-dominated epoch. We find that enhanced initial conditions (ICs) lead to qualitative differences in substructure relative to CDM. In particular, the subhalo mass function (SHMF) resulting from ICs with both an enhancement and cutoff is amplified at high masses and suppressed at low masses, indicating that DM substructure is sensitive to features in $P(k)$. Critically, the amplitude and shape of the SHMF enhancement depend on the wavenumber of the $P(k)$ excess and the presence or absence of a cutoff on smaller scales. These alterations to the SHMF are mainly imprinted at infall rather than during tidal evolution. Additionally, subhalos are found systematically closer to the host center, and their concentrations are increased in scenarios with $P(k)$ enhancement. Our work thus reveals effects that must be captured to enable $P(k)$ reconstruction using DM substructure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15340" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WALLABY Pilot Survey: A gas-rich diffuse dwarf on the baryonic Tully Fisher relation</a><span class="id">[2509.15340]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Diffuse dwarf galaxies, and particularly ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs), challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the role of dark matter due to their large sizes, low surface brightness, and varying dark matter content.

We investigate how realistic 3D radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) model atmospheres affect carbon abundances in CEMP stars and implications for their classification and Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We focus on biases from traditional 1D hydrostatic models. We use the M3DIS code to compute 3D RHD model atmospheres for main-sequence and sub-giant stars over a wide range of metallicities and carbon enhancements. Synthetic spectra of the CH G-band are calculated with 3D radiative transfer and compared to spectra from classical 1D MARCS models. We derive abundance corrections and apply them to a large SAGA database sample to quantify effects on the carbon abundance distribution and CEMP classification. Our new 3D CEMP models predict cooler upper atmospheric layers than in 1D models, resulting in stronger CH absorption and lower inferred carbon abundances by up to -0.9 dex at the lowest metallicities. Carbon enhancement in the atmosphere itself increases molecular opacities and leads to radiative re-heating, partly offsetting adiabatic cooling in 3D models and reducing 3D-1D abundance corrections. Applying these corrections lowers the CEMP fraction by up to 20% below [Fe/H]=-3 and alters the relative contribution of CEMP sub-classes. The fraction of CEMP-no stars increases while the number of CEMP-r/s stars decreases, due to the downward revision of absolute carbon abundances. These changes bring the Galactic carbon distribution into better agreement with GCE models assuming a 20% contribution from faint supernovae. Realistic model atmospheres are essential to reliably reconstruct the Galaxy's early chemical enrichment history.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational atoms beyond the test field limit: The case of Sgr A* and ultralight dark matter</a><span class="id">[2411.18601]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We construct gravitational atoms including self-gravity, obtaining solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations for a scalar field surrounding a non-rotating black hole in a quasi-stationary approximation.

However, challenges such as detecting Earth-like exoplanets in nearby habitable zones and probing the influence of dark matter in galactic environments require sub-microarcsecond accuracy. With a 6–8 meter large-aperture telescope operating across at visible wavelengths, the Habitable Worlds Observatory by NASA can combine astrometry and direct imaging to detect rocky exoplanets within 10 parsecs and study their atmospheres. We consider here the scientific requirements and present a concept for a dedicated astrometric instrument on HWO. It is capable to produce diffraction-limited images of large fields, achieving a point-spread function (PSF) precision of 20 milliarcseconds. Equipped with a detector calibration system, HWO can perform high precision astrometry, and, detect and measure the orbit of Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of Nearby Solar-type stars. HWO can dramatically improve current constraints on the self- interaction cross-section of heavy dark matter particles (WIMPs) and on the masses of ultra-high dark matter particles, through the study of stellar motions in galactic environments. The visible channel of the instrument features a large CMOS-based focal plane with stitched pixel arrays, enabling a large field of view. The “Detector Calibration Unit” system uses interferometric laser fringes to calibrate pixel positions. Using differential astrometry and pointed observations with a stable telescope design enables extended integration times, enhancing sensitivity to sub-microarcsecond precision for detecting exoplanets and studying dark matter through stellar motion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A spectral library and census of near-infrared stellar large-amplitude variables from Palomar Gattini-IR</a><span class="id">[2510.18959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a near-infrared census of stellar large-amplitude variables (LAVs) observed by the Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) surveyor from 2019-2021.

A significant calibration challenge for high-frequency VLBI stems from rapid variations in the atmospheric water vapor content above each telescope in the array, which induce corresponding fluctuations in the phase of the correlated signal that limit the coherent integration time and thus the achievable sensitivity. In this paper, we introduce a model that describes station-based phase corruptions jointly with a parameterization for the source structure. We adopt a Gaussian Process (GP) prescription for the time evolution of these phase corruptions, which provides sufficient flexibility to capture even highly erratic phase behavior. The use of GPs permits the application of a Kalman filtering algorithm for numerical marginalization of these phase corruptions, which permits efficient exploration of the remaining parameter space. Our model also removes the need to specify an arbitrary “reference station” during calibration, instead establishing a global phase zeropoint by enforcing the GPs at all stations to have fixed mean and finite variance. We validate our method using a real EHT observation of the blazar 3C 279, demonstrating that our approach yields calibration solutions that are consistent with those determined by the EHT Collaboration. The model presented here can be straightforwardly extended to incorporate frequency-dependent phase behavior, such as is relevant for the frequency phase transfer calibration technique.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transfer Learning Beyond the Standard Model</a><span class="id">[2510.19168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Machine learning enables powerful cosmological inference but typically requires many high-fidelity simulations covering many cosmological models.

This exploration benefits from dimensionality reduction techniques, which not only lessen computational demands but also highlight potential for describing physical characteristics. The resulting structures encode information about pulsar similarities that extend beyond standard spin parameters, revealing relationships that are not readily apparent in traditional diagrams. With a physically motivated topological perspective, we leverage the strengths of these methods and present results that span from prospective source classification and the emergence of new classes to catalog comparison, among other applications. This new approach enables fresh interpretations of longstanding problems, laying a new foundation for visualizing the pulsar population and categorizing sources. Building on this, we identify several sources as likely members of specific binary subclasses and investigate the potential transitional nature of others. Furthermore, we extend the use of graph theory to the boundary of machine learning, demonstrating its capability for binary separation in an unsupervised context.

Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments. For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure. Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the experiment's sensitivity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Singular Value-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization (SAFR)</a><span class="id">[2510.19542]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Atmospheric tomography, the problem of reconstructing atmospheric turbulence profiles from wavefront sensor measurements, is an integral part of many adaptive optics systems. It is used to enhance the image quality of ground-based telescopes, such as for the Multiconjugate Adaptive Optics Relay For ELT Observations (MORFEO) instrument on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). To solve this problem, a singular-value decomposition (SVD) based approach has been proposed before. In this paper, we focus on the numerical implementation of the SVD-based Atmospheric Tomography with Fourier Domain Regularization Algorithm (SAFR) and its performance for Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems. The key features of the SAFR algorithm are the utilization of the FFT and the pre-computation of computationally demanding parts. Together, this yields a fast algorithm with less memory requirements than commonly used Matrix Vector Multiplication (MVM) approaches. We evaluate the performance of SAFR regarding reconstruction quality and computational expense in numerical experiments using the simulation environment COMPASS, in which we use an MCAO setup resembling the physical parameters of the MORFEO instrument of the ELT.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19594" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Synergies between Twinkle and Ariel: a Pilot Study</a><span class="id">[2510.19594]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Launching in 2027 and 2029, respectively, Twinkle and Ariel will conduct the first large-scale homogeneous spectroscopic surveys of the atmospheres of hundreds of diverse exoplanets. This will fundamentally transition the field to an era of population-level characterisation. In this pilot study, we aim to explore possible synergies between Twinkle and Ariel to determine for instance whether prior Twinkle observations can substantially inform the target selection and observing strategy of Ariel. This study primarily aims to encourage further investigation by both consortium communities by showing what a potential scientific synergy would look like on a promising scientific case that requires further exploration. For this aim, we select a small subset of &quot;cool&quot; planets that are also particularly well-suited to be observed by Twinkle and therefore Ariel. By using representative noise estimates for both missions, we compute the number of visits required for an observation. Then, we simulate and retrieve transmission spectra of each target, assuming gaseous, H2/He-dominated atmospheres and various atmospheric models. For all candidates, we find that atmospheric parameters are generally retrieved well within 1-sigma to input values, with Ariel typically achieving tighter constraints. We demonstrate that for a small subset of cool gaseous planets, exploitable synergies exist between Twinkle and Ariel observations and Twinkle may very well provide a vantage point to plan Ariel observations. The true extent of the potential synergies, far beyond our considered sample, will be determined by the final target lists. Once Twinkle is operational and its performance is known, it could reliably inform Ariel's target prioritization and Ariel's capabilities which are already well-established can help define optimal targets and observational approaches for Twinkle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global time-frequency search for stellar-mass binary black holes in LISA</a><span class="id">[2510.19047]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a complete pipeline for detecting and characterising gravitational waves (GWs) produced by the inspiral of stellar-mass binary black holes in data from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The analysis framework relies on an efficient time-frequency implementation of an adaptive semi-coherent detection statistic, which we show to be robust against non-stationary noise and the presence of gaps of varying duration and cadence. The search is able to detect signals down to a coherent signal-to-noise ratio $\approx$ 11 over the full parameter space of black holes with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum and orbital eccentricity $\leq$ 0.01 when deployed on the 2-year-long LISA Data Challenge Yorsh. The search can be run within a day using $\approx$ 40 GPUs. The techniques presented here have wider applications in GW astronomy, in particular the search for extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in LISA data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using LSDB to enable large-scale catalog distribution, cross-matching, and analytics</a><span class="id">[2501.02103]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory will generate an unprecedented volume of data, including approximately 60 petabytes of raw data and around 30 trillion observed sources, posing a significant challenge for large-scale and end-user scientific analysis. As part of the LINCC Frameworks Project we are addressing these challenges with the development of the HATS (Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme) format and analysis package LSDB. HATS partitions data adaptively using a hierarchical tiling system to balance the file sizes, enabling efficient parallel analysis. Recent updates include improved metadata consistency, support for incremental updates, and enhanced compatibility with evolving datasets. LSDB complements HATS by providing a scalable, user-friendly interface for large catalog analysis, integrating spatial queries, crossmatching, and time-series tools while utilizing Dask for parallelization. We have successfully demonstrated the use of these tools with datasets such as ZTF and Pan-STARRS data releases on both cluster and cloud environments. We are deeply involved in several ongoing collaborations to ensure alignment with community needs, with future plans for IVOA standardization and support for upcoming Rubin, Euclid and Roman data. We provide our code and materials at this http URL .</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Low-temperature Performance of $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga, Al)_5O_{12}}$:Ce Scintillators</a><span class="id">[2508.13844]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope) mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2 different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time. Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2 K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.</p></div></details></article></body>
