Extending this capability to observations promises new insight into the stochastic excitation of solar p-modes, the source depth distribution below the photosphere, and the dominant physical processes underlying acoustic wave excitation. Such measurements would also enable improved characterization of the complex wavefield in the lower chromosphere and open the possibility of ultra-local helioseismic diagnostics. In this work, we assess an observational strategy for the detection of local acoustic wavefronts on the Sun using the National Science Foundation's Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope's Visible Tunable Filter (DKIST/VTF). Because wavefront identification requires high spatial and temporal resolution and is limited by the small amplitudes of the wave perturbations, we focus on identifying specific wavelength combinations within spectral lines that maximize the sensitivity to the wave signal at the atmospheric heights where that signal is highest while minimizing contamination by atmospheric variability at other heights. Under the cadence and spectral resolution constraints of DKIST/VTF observations and for the particular simulated wavefront we examine, this approach suggests two possible strategies for the detection of acoustic wavefronts in solar observations: fast monochromatic imaging at 6302.425 A, or ordered interleaved observations in the blue wing of either the Fe I 6302.5 A or Fe I 5250.6 A line (between 6302.419 A and 6302.465 A, or between 5250.579 A and 5250.607 A respectively).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07188" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coma Volatile Composition and Thermal Physics in Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) Measured Near Closest Approach to Earth with NASA-IRTF</a><span class="id">[2602.07188]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 2023 perihelion passage of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) afforded an opportunity to measure the abundances and spatial distributions of coma volatiles in an Oort cloud comet at high spatial resolution near its close approach to Earth ($\Delta_\mathrm{min}\sim 0.28$ au on UT February 1). We conducted near-infrared spectroscopic observations of C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using iSHELL at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on UT 2023 February 9. Our measurements securely detected fluorescent emission from H$_2$O, CO, OCS, CH$_3$OH, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_2$H$_2$, and HCN. For each instrumental setting we took exposures with the slit oriented parallel and also perpendicular to the projected Sun-comet vector, thereby enabling a test of the spatial distributions of these molecules. We report rotational temperatures, production rates, and abundance ratios (i.e., mixing ratios) for all sampled species. Our measurements found that molecular abundances in C/2022 E3 were depleted compared to their average values in Oort cloud comets with the exception of OCS, which was consistent. The H$_2$O production rate varied significantly and was likely tied to nucleus rotation effects. Measurements at the two slit orientations showed distinct column density and rotational temperature profiles for H$_2$O. Peak temperatures occurred off-nucleus and slower cooling was present in the anti-sunward hemisphere, consistent with the presence of icy grain sublimation in the coma.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07246" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Detailed Model Atmosphere Analysis of Hot White Dwarfs in DESI DR1</a><span class="id">[2602.07246]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a detailed model atmosphere analysis of hot white dwarfs in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. Our sample includes 19,321 unique targets with $G_{\rm BP}-G_{\rm RP}\leq0$. We use the DESI spectra along with Gaia parallaxes and SDSS, Pan-STARRS, and SkyMapper photometry to perform spectroscopic and photometric fits. We find a significant discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic masses for DA white dwarfs (a systematic offset of 0.05-$0.06~M_\odot$), indicating problems with the broad hydrogen line profiles in DESI spectroscopy data. Our photometric fits are consistent with a peak at the canonical mass of $0.6~M_\odot$. A remarkable feature of the mass distribution is the prevalence of magnetic white dwarfs among the ultramassive DA population and that of warm DQs in the non-DA distribution. We identify 70 DQs in the DESI hot white dwarf sample, including 9 DAQs with carbon and hydrogen atmospheres. We constrain the ratio of non-DA to DA white dwarfs as a function of temperature, and discuss the implications for the spectral evolution of white dwarfs in the temperature range $10^5-10^4$ K. We also discuss unusual objects in the sample, including metal-rich white dwarfs and extremely low mass white dwarfs. This analysis provides the first look at the large sample of Gaia-selected white dwarf candidates that will be observed with multiplexed spectroscopic surveys like DESI, SDSS-V, 4MOST, and WEAVE over the next several years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A NICER view of the corona through time-dependent Comptonization of the quasi-periodic oscillations in nine black-hole X-ray binaries</a><span class="id">[2602.07247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a systematic study of the evolution of the corona geometry in nine black hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) using archival data from NICER. We identify 171 observations exhibiting quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) across various spectral states and model the time-averaged energy spectra of the source, as well as the energy-dependent rms and phase-lag spectra of the QPO, with the time-dependent Comptonization model vKompthdk. This allows us to simultaneously constrain the corona size and feedback fraction during outbursts. By using the power color hue diagnostics, we identify different spectral states, and observe that the QPO frequency increases from $\sim$0.1 Hz to $\sim$10 Hz in the low-hard and hard-intermediate states (LHS and HIMS), and remains approximately constant at 4–5 Hz in the soft-intermediate state (SIMS). The corona size shows significant evolution: the corona is large ($\sim10^4$–$10^5$ km) in the LHS, contracts rapidly to $\sim10^3$ km in the HIMS, and exhibits a flare-like expansion near the HIMS-to-SIMS transition. In the SIMS and high-soft state (HSS), the corona becomes compact and stable (4000–8000 km). The feedback fraction of the corona photons increases during the periods in which the corona contracts and decreases during the periods in which the corona expands, indicating a change of the disk-corona coupling. Our results are consistent with previous QPO-based studies using vKompthdk on some individual sources. This work, however, provides the first view of the coronal evolution across outbursts for a diverse BHXRB sample, offering critical insights into coronal behavior as a function of the spectral state of the source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07389" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A General Formulation of the Kinematic Dipole as a Functional of Selection and Source Properties: Beyond the Ellis–Baldwin Approximation</a><span class="id">[2602.07389]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dipole anisotropy in galaxy and QSO number counts induced by the motion of the observer (the kinematic dipole) provides an important test of cosmological isotropy and a comparison with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole. Traditionally, the Ellis &amp; Baldwin expression,$\mathcal{A}=2+x(1+\alpha)$, has been widely adopted, assuming power-law number counts and a single power-law spectral energy distribution (SED). Realistic surveys, however, involve a range of non-ideal effects, including diverse SEDs, finite instrumental bandpasses, non-power-law number counts, multi-band photometry and photo-$z$ selections, and direction-dependent or stochastic detection limits. In this paper, we incorporate these effects explicitly at the theoretical level and present a unified formulation of the kinematic dipole for a general parent population and a general multi-dimensional selection function. We show that the dipole amplitude is not described by a single index, but is instead given by a functional, $\mathcal{A}[\mathcal{W},f]$, defined as the Doppler response of the selection function acting on the underlying population. We demonstrate that the classical Ellis–Baldwin result is recovered as a special limiting case of this formalism, and clarify the relation between the theoretical coefficient $\mathcal{A}$ and the dipole vector estimated from finite catalogs, separating theoretical response from statistical uncertainty. This framework provides a basis for reinterpreting reported discrepancies in kinematic dipole measurements across surveys and is directly applicable to future wide-area, multi-band observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imprints of gravitational waves from magnetar spindown in GRB X-ray afterglows</a><span class="id">[2602.07419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Given that newborn magnetars are considered potential central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), there is strong motivation to identify gravitational wave (GW) signatures within GRB samples. If the X-ray afterglow of a GRB is powered by a magnetar, and the initial spindown of the magnetar is dominated by the GW radiation induced by $r$-mode instability or magnetic-field-induced deformation, the decay of the X-ray flux would record the information of the GW radiation. We find that GRB 130603B potentially represents a rare and precious case where the spindown of the central magnetar is dominated in-turn by $r$-mode and magnetic distortion-induced GW radiation. By fitting the X-ray light curve of GRB 130603B in this model, we obtain the initial spin period of magnetar $\sim 5.3\times 10^{-4}$ s, the effective dipole magnetic field strength $\sim 5.2\times 10^{14}$ G, the ellipticity of the magnetar $\sim 1.3\times 10^{-4}$, and the amplitude of $r$-mode oscillation $\sim3.3\times 10^{-2}$. It may serve as a reliable approach for investigating neutron star physics by comparing the parameters estimated using the method presented in this manuscript with those obtained from future GW observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FPIC: a new Particle-In-Cell code for stationary and axisymmetric black-hole spacetimes</a><span class="id">[2602.07452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we present a newly developed GRPIC code framework called FPIC, providing a detailed description of the Maxwell-equations solver, of the particle “pushers”, and of the other algorithms that are needed in this approach. We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle “pushers” are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07459" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SXP 31.0 – the 2025 near-Eddington double X-ray outburst after 26 years of quiescence</a><span class="id">[2602.07459]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SXP 31.0 is an X-ray source in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that was first identified as a Be X-ray Binary (BeXRB) system when it went into X-ray outbusrst in 1998. It is now known to consist of an OBe main sequence star and a neutron star with a spin period of 31s. In 2025 a new X-ray outburst phase began with the source exhibiting a luminosities approaching the Eddington limit of 10^38 erg/s. Unusually, H-alpha images show it has a surrounding halo whose nature has not been clear. In this paper, we report new observations of this halo, including the first multi-fibre Integrated Flux Unit (IFU) observations, which identify this emission as probably a coincidental HII region. The X-ray, UV &amp; optical data cover a period of  200d and reveal that the source underwent two bright, back-to-back, Type II outbursts in 2025 - a rare occurrence for any BeXRB system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Astrophysical positronium and Dicke superradiance</a><span class="id">[2602.07489]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dicke superradiance is a fascinating phenomenon in which a large number of atoms cooperate to produce a brief and very intense burst of spontaneous emission. This phenomenon has been well studied in the laboratory, but its astrophysical aspects have only recently attracted the attention of a small number of researchers. Since the phenomenon of Dicke superradiance is relatively little known to the wider astrophysical community, we provide a fairly detailed review of its elementary theory in the appendix and speculate on the significance of superradiance for astrophysical hydrogen and positronium, given the abundant formation of the latter near the galactic center.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07528" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A tension between dust and gas radii: the role of substructures and external photoevaporation in protoplanetary disks</a><span class="id">[2602.07528]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Protoplanetary disk substructures are thought to play a crucial role in disk evolution and planet formation. Population studies of disks large-sample size surveys show that substructures, and their rapid formation, are needed to reproduce the observed spectral indices. Moreover, they enable the simultaneous reproduction of the observed spectral index and size-luminosity distributions. This study aims to investigate the necessity of substructures and predict their characteristics to reproduce gas-to-dust size ratios observed in the Lupus star-forming region. We performed a population synthesis study of gas and dust evolution in disks using a two-population model (two-pop-py) and the DustPy code. We considered the effects of viscous evolution, dust growth, fragmentation, transport, and external photoevaporation. The simulated population distributions were obtained by post-processing the resulting disk profiles of surface density, maximum grain size, and disk temperature. Although substructures help reduce the discrepancy between simulated and observed disk gas-to-dust size ratios; even when accounting for external photoevaporation, they do not fully resolve it. Only specific initial conditions in disks undergoing viscous evolution with external photoevaporation can reproduce the observations, highlighting a fine-tuning problem. While substructured disks reproduce dust size and spectral index, they tend to overestimate gas radii. The results ultimately highlight the main challenge of simultaneously reproducing gas and dust sizes. One possible explanation is that the outermost substructure is linked to the disk truncation radius, which determines the gas radius, or that substructures are frequent enough to always be near the gas outer radius.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07557" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospective bounds on f(Q) gravity with pulsar timing arrays</a><span class="id">[2602.07557]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) have recently provided compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, offering a unique window into fundamental physics. Here, we explore implications for symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity, a theory in which deviations from General Relativity (GR) arise through the non-metricity scalar $f(Q)$. Crucially, tensor modes propagate at the speed of light in this framework. However, their amplitude undergoes a modified damping during their evolution. We adopt a model-independent parameterization and derive an analytic approximation to the tensor mode transfer function to obtain the spectral energy density of primordial inflationary gravitational waves. Comparison with the NANOGrav 15-year and IPTA second data releases show that the inferred damping parameter $n$ remains consistent with GR, yet allows small deviations that could be observable. We then conduct a Fisher information matrix forecasts which demonstrate that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observatory will improve these constraints by several orders of magnitude, offering the potential to distinguish $f(Q)$ gravity from GR with high precision. These results highlight PTAs as powerful probes of non-metricity-based modifications to gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-component $γ$-Ray Structure from the CR Sources Within Dense Clouds</a><span class="id">[2602.07610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations have revealed that several cosmic ray (CR) sources themselves exhibit pronounced double power-law features in their radiation spectra. Combined with the phenomenon of two-component structure in the observed CR energy spectrum supported by multi-messenger data, this raises a fundamental question: can the two-component structure of the cosmic ray energy spectrum and the double power-law feature of the gamma-ray radiation energy spectrum from supernova remnants be understood within a unified picture? In this study, we propose a two-component model that incorporates the re-acceleration of background “sea&quot; CR particles by astrophysical sources to systematically explain the formation of double power-law spectra within those sources. Our model successfully reproduces the gamma-ray observations of multiple CR sources. The results support that double power-law structures may be a generic feature of Galactic CR sources within crushed clouds. This work offers a new theoretical perspective on the origin and propagation of cosmic rays, and its predictions may be further tested with future observations of a larger sample of CR sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Multi-messenger Search for a Nearby Microquasar Contributor to the Cosmic Ray Knee</a><span class="id">[2602.07620]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, LHAASO has detected five microquasars with high confidence, which are associated with SS 433, V4641 Sgr, GRS 1915+105, MAXI J1820+070, and Cygnus X-1, respectively. Except for Cygnus X-1, the maximum energies of gamma-ray photons emitted from these sources all exceed 100 TeV, strongly suggesting that microquasars are capable of accelerating cosmic-ray particles to energies above the PeV range. This work investigates the origin of the cosmic-ray knee region based on gamma-ray observational data from the aforementioned sources, combined with cosmic-ray proton, helium, and all-particle energy spectra, as well as anisotropy observations. Calculations indicate that these known sources contribute negligibly to the cosmic-ray knee region. However, further joint analysis reveals that a single microquasar located in a region approximately on the 2.6 kiloparsec scale in the anti-Galactic center direction can reasonably reproduce the observed cosmic-ray proton, helium, and all-particle energy spectra, as well as anisotropy features detected near Earth. We propose that this region may host one or several unidentified microquasars or similar systems, whose accelerated cosmic rays could dominate the observational characteristics of the knee region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07631" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Informed Inference of 21-cm Global Signal Parameters</a><span class="id">[2602.07631]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how and when the first stars and galaxies formed remains one of the central challenges in modern cosmology. These structures emerged during the transition from the Dark Ages to the Cosmic Dawn, a period that remains observationally unconstrained despite strong theoretical progress. During this epoch, neutral hydrogen absorbed a fraction of cosmic microwave background photons through its 21-cm hyperfine transition, producing a 21-cm absorption signal whose evolution encodes the early Universe's thermal and ionization history. However, extracting the underlying astrophysical parameters from this signal is limited by severe parameter degeneracies, which cannot be resolved without independent observational probes. The next-generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors, such as Cosmic Explorer (CE), will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers up to very large redshifts and hence will detect a fraction of them formed within the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. The merger rate of these BBHs will depend on the star formation rate density (SFRD) at these redshifts, together with the BBH formation efficiency and a time delay distribution. Therefore, the merger rate of these BBHs can work as a tracer of the SFRD in the redshift range $\sim 13-25$. In this Letter, we establish a novel multi-messenger framework and present a proof-of-principle concept of how the observations of BBH mergers form next-generation GW detectors can improve the inference of parameters generating the 21-cm cosmic hydrogen signal, and help break degeneracies between them.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07716" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A MeerKAT search for persistent radio sources towards twenty-five localised Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2602.07716]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of persistent radio sources (PRSs) associated with repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) has shed light on the immediate environments and possible progenitors of these FRBs. The confirmed PRSs may support the theory that FRB progenitors are compact central engines, whilst the non-detections suggest diversity of FRB's local environment. We perform a subarcsecond-resolution MeerKAT search at 1.28 GHz on 25 well-localised FRB positions provided by ASKAP and MeerTRAP. We detect 14 radio sources and provide flux upper limits for 12 non-detections (both these numbers include a source that was detected during two epochs of observation, and not detected during one epoch, adding up to 26). One radio source shows variability as seen in flux variations over three epochs of observation. Archival optical data reveal excesses in the direction of 13 detected radio sources. Similarly for four sources in the X-ray band, with one possibly being a high-energy signature of a radio galaxy core. Since we cannot definitively classify our detected radio sources as PRSs, future high-resolution observations with e-MERLIN will be required to resolve the radio emission and pronounce on the presence of compact PRSs associated with the 14 detected sources presented here.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes from a Localized Bump or Dip Feature in a Single-Field Inflationary Potential</a><span class="id">[2602.07951]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the production of scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes in a single-field inflation model with a localized bump or dip feature in the potential. Introducing such a localized feature temporarily decelerates the slow-roll inflaton, amplifying the primordial curvature power spectrum into a sharp peak. Consequently, this enhancement sources a significant stochastic background of gravitational waves and leads to abundant formation of primordial black holes. Through eight benchmark cases, we show that the predicted abundances of primordial black holes can remain compatible with current observational limits, while the corresponding gravitational wave spectra peaking across a wide range of frequencies are accessible to future gravitational wave experiments in multiple observational bands.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-resonance preheating in deformed attractor models: oscillon formation and evolution</a><span class="id">[2602.07972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is well known that, in potentials that are quadratic near the minimum but shallower away, such as small-$\alpha$ ($\ll M_P^2$) attractors, the inflaton condensate fragments into localized compact objects known as oscillons during self-resonance preheating. In this work we investigate the self-resonance in deformed $\alpha$-attractor T-model with a Gaussian feature near the minimum, distant from inflation's end. Linear analysis reveals altered resonance bands and deformed Floquet charts dependent on feature parameters. In fully nonlinear lattice simulations, we find that the gradient energy transfer is largely independent of the potential feature parameter $h$. In contrast, after resonance terminates, the subsequent evolution of gradient energy becomes strongly dependent on $h$. Statistical analysis reveals that models with the potential feature produce larger number of smaller oscillons, with a reduced energy stored in these objects, increasingly suppressed as the magnitude of $h$ grows. By tracking the total energy and the gradient energy contained in oscillons, we find that in models with nonzero $h$ oscillons are systematically shorter-lived, with this effect strengthening for larger $h$. The gravitational wave emission is dominated by the resonance stage and is strongly suppressed once oscillons form. Potential features leave the low-frequency spectrum largely unchanged but significantly modify the high-frequency tail. Although a complete reheating description requires external couplings and higher-resolution simulations, clear qualitative differences of cosmic expansion history already emerge within our simulated time window. These results highlight the important role of potential features in shaping reheating dynamics and their cosmological implications, and provide a deeper understanding of preheating dynamics and the properties of oscillons.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of embedded circumplanetary winds on the circumstellar disk: I.

Such circumplanetary outflows have been proposed to explain kinematic and chemical structures in protoplanetary disks. We investigate the immediate impact of circumplanetary outflows on the circumstellar disk environment, the planetary vicinity, and planetary growth. We performed three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using \texttt{FARGO3D}, implementing a parametric wind launched from the vicinity of an embedded planet. Although the imposed configurations for the outflows do not significantly alter the global structure of the disk, they do substantially redistribute material in the vicinity of the embedded planet. In particular, the wind redirects accretion flows from polar to equatorial latitudes, resulting in variable accretion patterns over time. Although the mass accretion rate variations depend on the efficiency of the outflows, their presence diminishes the accretion rate over time and the total mass reservoir within the Hill sphere and the planet's direct vicinity, potentially slowing or limiting planetary growth.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08109" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toward a Comprehensive Grid of Cepheid Models with MESA II.

In previous work, we studied the effect of varying microphysics, including solar abundance mixtures, nuclear networks, atmosphere models, mixing-length prescriptions, treatments of convective boundaries, and numerical setup on evolutionary tracks. Here, we extend this analysis to the surface abundances of the dominant elements H, He, C, N, O, Ne, and Mg. We establish a reference model and 22 variants for each mass and metallicity, evolving them from the Zero-Age Main Sequence to central helium exhaustion. Masses between 2 to 8 solar mass and metallicities Z=0.0014, 0.004, 0.014 are explored, spanning the range of classical Cepheids. Both canonical and overshooting models are computed and compared. We find that uncertainties in surface abundances are generally small, arising mainly from variations in the depth of the convective envelope during the first dredge-up. The size of the convective envelope is sensitive to many aspects, including mass and metallicity. The central C/O ratio, relevant for white dwarf evolution, can vary by about 0.15, driven largely by convective boundary treatments or by modifying the 12C(alpha,gamma)16O reaction rate during helium burning. Surface and central abundances for the considered models at several benchmark points during the evolution are provided online.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complementary Roles of Distance and Growth Probes in Testing Time-Varying Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2602.08207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Distance measurements have long provided the primary observational constraints on the expansion history of the Universe and the properties of dark energy. However, because such observables depend on cumulative line-of-sight integrals over the Hubble rate, their sensitivity to time-dependent features of the dark energy equation of state is intrinsically limited. In this work, we examine this limitation from an information-based perspective using the eigenvalue structure of the Fisher information matrix constructed from distance, expansion rate, and growth observables. We show that distance and expansion-rate data generically produce a strongly hierarchical Fisher spectrum dominated by a single information mode, reflecting an irreducible loss of sensitivity to temporal variations in dark energy. This behavior can be traced directly to the integrated kernel structure of geometric observables. Growth measurements, by contrast, respond through differential dynamics and can introduce additional independent information directions. Using both controlled mock data and survey-like configurations representative of next-generation experiments, we find that the impact of growth information depends not only on its nominal precision but also on the structure of the data covariance. In simplified mock setups, growth measurements can partially activate a second information direction even at moderate precision. In Euclid-like configurations, however, the information remains effectively one-dimensional until growth precision reaches the percent level, below which a second mode emerges rapidly. These results clarify the complementary roles of distance and growth probes and provide a model-independent criterion for assessing the physical content of cosmological constraints on dynamical dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08223" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Minimal Interpretation of the Galactic Cosmic-Ray Spectrum from GeV to PeV Energies</a><span class="id">[2602.08223]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-precision measurements of the cosmic-ray (CR) proton spectrum have revealed significant deviations from a simple power-law behaviour. These deviations are characterised by three prominent features: (i) a progressive spectral hardening above approximately 200 GeV, (ii) an excess between 10 and 30 TeV (the “multi-TeV bump”), followed by a sharp turnover around 100 TeV, and (iii) a pronounced structure between 0.1 and 10 PeV (the “PeV bump”). We propose a minimal two cosmic-ray population framework that consistently accounts for the observed CR proton spectrum across six decades in energy, from GeV to PeV. In this scenario, the spectral complexity arises naturally from a transition between two Galactic CR proton populations in the 10-100 TeV energy range. The low-energy population exhibits a sharp cutoff at tens of TeV, while a second, higher-energy population emerges and dominates above 100 TeV, terminating with a smooth exponential cutoff at approximately 6.5 PeV. This framework reproduces all observed spectral features without invoking contributions from nearby sources or requiring non-standard assumptions about particle acceleration or propagation. Recent gamma-ray observations of supernova remnants, star-forming regions, and microquasars provide plausible astrophysical candidates for the origin of the two CR components.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrino Emission from Gamma-ray Burst Jet Propagating inside the Cavity within Active Galactic Nucleus Accretion Disks</a><span class="id">[2602.08319]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) from the merger of binary compact objects (BCOs) could occur in the accretion disks of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Before merging, the BCO will inevitably form a low-density cavity. The sGRB jet will interact with the AGN disk photons during its propagation through the cavity, leading to unique electromagnetic and neutrino signatures. In this work, we investigate the influence of the AGN disk photon field on neutrino emission within the internal dissipation regions of a two-component sGRB jet (a narrow core and a wide wing). We find that, due to the strong AGN disk photon field, the neutrino flux at high-energy part (e.g., PeV to EeV) will be suppressed, while the relatively lower-energy part (e.g., TeV to PeV) will be enhanced. Such a conclusion can enhance the constraints on GRB parameters (e.g., baryonic loading factor and bulk Lorentz factor) based on the future detection or non-detection of high-energy neutrinos from GRBs. Besides, the two-component jet can display two-bump structure at higher and lower energy in the neutrino spectrum. Therefore, the joint observations of electromagnetic and neutrinos emission can help us identify the sGRB jet and its structure in the AGN disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter from Eternity</a><span class="id">[2602.08338]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose that the totality of dark matter in the universe might ascribe its origin to one of the key properties of cosmological inflation, that it may be eternal: regions that at the end of the primordial accelerated expansion of the universe never reheated, but keep eternally inflating, manifest themselves as primordial black holes in our observable universe.

The high-resolution spectra obtained from the reflection grating spectrometer on board XMM-Newton was analysed focusing on studying eclipse and out-of-eclipse spectra separately. Several continuum models were explored in SPEX for which we studied the properties of emitting and absorbing matter depending on the emission and absorption lines identified in the spectra. It was found that the X-ray continuum is heavily absorbed by a neutral gas and photoionised matter. Emission lines from Si v, Mg xii, Mg xi, and Ne x were detected in the eclipse spectrum. In particular, H-like lines of Mg and Ne with a significance greater than 5 sigma in the eclipse spectrum and 3 sigma in the out-of-eclipse spectrum. But in the out-of-eclipse spectrum any absorption lines, if any, were detected with a significance less than 2 sigma. RGS light curve showed dips in the out-of-eclipse spectrum which are not due to an increase in the column absorption but may be produced by instabilities in the accretion stream. On the other hand, the level of counts above 20 was compatible with the X-ray background. A simple local continuum model was used to describe the He-like triplet of Ne and the derived values of R and G ratio parameters pointed out that the UV photospheric field should be important at the line production site and an electron density greater than 10(12) cm-3. As a consequence, a hybrid plasma may be present in the binary system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kosmulator: A Python framework for cosmological inference with MCMC</a><span class="id">[2602.08424]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present Kosmulator, a modular and vectorised Python framework designed to accelerate the statistical testing of cosmological models.

Kosmulator addresses this by leveraging array-native execution and efficient ensemble slice sampling (via Zeus) to perform rapid Bayesian inference. We validate the framework against the industry-standard Cobaya code using a combination of Type Ia Supernovae, Cosmic Chronometers, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data. Our results demonstrate that Kosmulator reproduces Cobaya's posterior constraints to within $\leq0.3\sigma$ statistical agreement on $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{m}$ and $&lt;0.6\%$ precision on $\chi^{2}$, while achieving a $\sim 4.5\times$ reduction in wall-clock time on a single CPU core compared to a standard MPI-parallelised baseline. Furthermore, we showcase the framework's utility by constraining the implicit power-law $f(Q)$ &quot;$f_1$CDM&quot; model and demonstrating its automated model selection capabilities (AIC/BIC).

We investigate the interplay between convection, rotation, and cloud thermal feedback using a selected sample of Y dwarf atmospheric models. We explore effective temperatures $400~\mathrm{K} \leq T_{\mathrm{eff}} \leq 600~\mathrm{K}$ and rotation periods $P_{\mathrm{rot}} = 2.5 \text{--} 20\ \mathrm{h}$, where salt and sulfide condensates are expected. We include $\mathrm{KCl,~Na_{2}S}$, and $\mathrm{MnS}$ clouds to assess their atmospheric impact and identify circulation regimes across parameter space. We run twelve general circulation models (GCMs) spanning this grid and develop additional physics modules for the THOR GCM to model brown dwarf atmospheres. The dynamical core is coupled to interior thermal perturbations near the radiative-convective boundary, a mixing-length convection scheme, gray two-stream radiative transfer with Rosseland-mean opacities, and simple cloud tracers including thermal feedback and scattering. All simulations exhibit a radiative-forcing-dominated regime with weak winds, minimal horizontal temperature contrasts, and no persistent jets. Convection controls vertical mixing and sets the extent of salt and sulfide cloud layers below the photosphere. Thermal structures equilibrate quickly and cloud radiative feedback remains insignificant, with limited variability. Within the gray radiative transfer framework adopted here, Y dwarf atmospheres in this parameter space are controlled by interior thermal radiation. Rotation sets modest variability, while clouds play a secondary role. Because our single-band approach does not capture spectral windows that could probe deeper cloud layers, our constraints on cloud radiative feedback are likely conservative, and we outline pathways toward more active regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08649" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IceCube's Sensitivity Prospects to MeV-Scale Axion-Like Particles from Core-Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2602.08649]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel framework to estimate the sensitivity and discovery potential of IceCube to axion-like particles (ALPs) produced in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), covering ALP masses from 1 MeV to several hundred MeV.

In contrast, turbulence-mediated reconnection yields significantly faster reconnection rates - about an order of magnitude higher than the so-called universal rate for plasmoid-mediated reconnection in MHD flows ($V_\text{rec}/V_A \sim 0.01$). We conclude that turbulence-driven reconnection is the dominant mechanism responsible for fast reconnection and flares in systems such as accretion flows and relativistic jets in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). In these environments, turbulence is driven by instabilities such as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI), Parker-Rayleigh-Taylor instability (PRTI), and current-driven kink instability (CDKI). Finally, we present 3D General Relativistic MHD simulations of accretion flows that confirm the crucial role of turbulence-mediated reconnection in AGN systems. These findings have important implications for understanding the origin of flares, particle acceleration, and the production of polarized radiation in these extreme environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synchrotron Self-Compton Process for Constraining sub-GeV Dark Matter in Omega Centauri via SKA</a><span class="id">[2602.08731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for the particle identity of dark matter (DM) continues to be a primary objective in modern physics.

The origin of the petrologic diversity observed in ordinary chondrites (OCs), the most common meteorites on Earth, remains debated. Competing models invoke either depth-dependent sampling of a single thermally stratified (&quot;onion-shell&quot;) parent body or contributions from multiple distinct parent bodies. Aims. We aim to determine which of the two models is preferred for LL chondrites. These are unique among OCs in exhibiting a bimodal petrologic distribution, with most meteorites being LL3 or LL6. Methods. We compare the spectral and mineralogical properties of LL chondrites and corresponding LL-chondrite-like near-Earth objects (NEOs) with their possible sources in the main asteroid belt. We also model the thermal histories of the proposed parent bodies, based on revised estimates of parent-body sizes. Results. The spectral and mineralogical diversity of LL chondrites is consistent with contributions from the bright, S-type component of the Nysa family (NysaS) and the Flora family, with NysaS supplying mainly low-petrologic-type material and Flora higher-grade material. Unequilibrated, LL3 chondrites appear to originate exclusively from NysaS. Similarly, LL-chondrite-like NEOs form two distinct subpopulations consistent with origins in these same families. Conclusions. Our results favour multiple parent bodies for LL chondrites. The petrologic differences between the NysaS and Flora parent bodies indicate that planetesimal accretion within the OC reservoir extended over 0.5-0.7 Myr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08763" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A single frequency approach to nonequilibrium modeling of the chromosphere</a><span class="id">[2602.08763]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The solar chromosphere is a region where radiation plays a critical role in energy transfer and interacts strongly with the plasma. In this layer, strong spectral lines, such as the Lyman lines, contribute significantly to radiative energy exchange. Due to the long ionization/relaxation timescale, departures from LTE become significant in the chromosphere. Accurately modeling this layer therefore requires one to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer for the Lyman transitions. We present an updated version of the MURaM code to enable more accurate simulations of chromospheric hydrogen level populations and temperature evolution. In the previous extension, a non-LTE equation of state, collisional transitions of hydrogen, and radiative transitions of non-Lyman lines were already implemented in the code. Building on this, we have now incorporated radiative transfer for the Lyman lines to compute radiative rate coefficients and the associated radiative losses. These were used to solve the population and temperature evolution equations, rendering the system self-consistent. To reduce computational cost, a single-frequency approximation was applied to each line in the numerical solution of the radiative transfer problem. The extended model shows good agreement with reference solutions from the Lightweaver framework, accurately capturing the radiative processes associated with Lyman lines in the chromosphere. The extension brings the simulated hydrogen level populations in the deep chromosphere closer to detailed radiative balance, while those in the upper chromosphere remain significantly out of balance, consistent with the expected conditions in the real solar atmosphere. The extension enables the MURaM code to accurately capture chromospheric dynamics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08806" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two-Dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability with Anisotropic Pressure</a><span class="id">[2602.08806]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability occurs in multiple heliospheric (solar-wind stream interfaces, planetary magnetospheres, cometary tails, heliopause flanks) and interstellar (protoplanetary disks, relativistic jets, neutron star accretion disks) environments. While the KH instability has been well-studied in the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit, only limited studies were performed in the collisionless regime, which is conducive to development of anisotropic pressures. Collisionless plasmas are often described using the Chew Goldberger and Low (CGL) equations which feature an anisotropic pressure tensor. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the CGL version of the KH instability using linearised and numerical techniques. We find that the largest growth rates and the greatest incidence of magnetic effects occur in the MHD limit. In the large relaxation time CGL limit, part of the energy goes into the formation of pressure anisotropies, resulting in smaller amounts of energy being available for bending the field lines. Consequently, when we cross-compare CGL and MHD simulations that are otherwise identical, the current densities are largest in the MHD limit, and the largest magnetic islands also form in that limit. Early and late time formation of pressure anisotropies have also been studied. We also find that the strongest trend for forming intermittencies in the flow also occurs in the MHD limit. The paper also discusses possible consequences of our results for turbulence and reconnection in the heliosheath (the layer between the solar wind termination shock and the heliopause).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08814" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Approach to Superflare Energy Determination</a><span class="id">[2602.08814]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new method for estimating the total energy radiated by stellar flares in broad-band continua, which assumes a constant emitting area but incorporates a time-dependent temperature evolution. This physically motivated approach offers an alternative to the commonly used method that assumes a fixed flare temperature about of 10 000 K and variable area. By allowing the temperature to vary over time while keeping the emitting area constant, our method captures more realistic flare behaviour. This time-dependent treatment of the flare temperature is supported by numerous solar observations, numerical simulations, and multiwavelength studies of active stars. We demonstrate that using peak flare temperatures estimated from a semi-empirical model grid, rather than assuming an ad-hoc flare temperature value, improves the accuracy of total energy estimates. Although the most precise results still require a multi-band photometry/spectroscopy or independently constrained flare temperatures, our method offers a practical and scalable solution for single-band observations. It is particularly well suited for main-sequence stars of spectral types K4 and later with known effective temperatures. Finally we discuss how the flare continuum behaves under varying chromospheric conditions. Our method improves flare energy estimates by incorporating a physically relevant time-dependent temperature evolution and empirically derived peak temperatures, rather than assuming a constant 10 000 K value. This modification reduces systematic errors that can reach factors up to ten as compared to previous estimates.

The outburst began with a low mass-accretion rate and was characterized as a low-luminosity outburst. The radius of the inner accretion disc remained constant throughout the outburst. Additionally, a growing neutral medium with constant density was detected in the local environment of 4U 1755$-$ this http URL hardness-intensity diagram (HID) did not follow the standard q-shaped pattern, indicating a non-canonical outburst. Instead, the HID showed a correlated evolution of hardness and source flux, suggesting a thermal disc origin of the flux. A wideband spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous NICER-NuSTAR data in two frameworks, based on kerrbb and bhspec. The results of bhspec (kerrbb) based modeling indicate that 4U 1755$-$338 is a high-inclination system, $67.44_{-3.03}^{+9.75}$ ($75.25_{-4.68}^{+5.59}$) degrees, and harbors a moderately spinning black hole with a spin parameter of $0.78_{-0.14}^{+0.02}$ ($0.50_{-0.43}^{+0.19}$) and a mass of $3.37_{-1.04}^{+0.45} (3.28_{-1.1}^{+1.7})M_{\odot}$ respectively. The inferred key parameters: black hole mass, spin, and system inclination are consistent across both modeling approaches. No reflection features were detected in the spectra of 4U 1755$-$338. The high spectral index, the blackbody nature ($L\propto T^4$) of the hardness ratio, the absence of reflection signatures, and the weak variability in the power density spectra indicate that the source remained in the high/soft state throughout the outburst.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08928" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hints of sign-changing scalar field energy density and a transient acceleration phase at $z\sim 2$ from model-agnostic reconstructions</a><span class="id">[2602.08928]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a data-driven reconstruction of the late-time expansion history and its implications for dark-energy dynamics.

Assuming GR at the background level, we map the reconstructed kinematics onto a dark-energy fluid and a scalar-field description, yielding the total potential and kinetic contributions that reproduce the inferred $H(z)$. To interpret the reconstruction, we consider both a minimal single-field model (canonical or phantom) and a two-field (quintom) system consisting of one canonical and one phantom scalar field (or families). Within the GR-based effective-fluid mapping, the inferred dark-energy density changes sign for all dataset combinations explored, transitioning from $\rho_{\rm DE}&lt;0$ at higher redshift to $\rho_{\rm DE}&gt;0$ toward the present, and defining a transition redshift $z_\dagger$ by $\rho_{\rm DE}(z_\dagger)=0$. A single canonical scalar cannot realize such a smooth evolution during expansion, whereas a phantom field or a two-field quintom framework can accommodate the required behavior; in particular, the two-field system permits smooth phantom-divide crossings at finite $\rho_{\rm DE}&gt;0$ and distinguishes them from the separate notion of a density zero crossing.

We found a period of $38.7\pm0.5~\mathrm{d}$, which is consistent with the rotation period determined from photometry and other activity indices.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08940" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microquasar Remnants as Pevatrons Illuminating the Galactic Cosmic Ray Knee</a><span class="id">[2602.08940]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Microquasars are primary candidates for Galactic PeVatrons, yet their collective contribution to the cosmic ray (CR) “knee&quot; remains poorly understood. We investigate this contribution by simulating anisotropic diffusive propagation through the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). Our results demonstrate that the GMF establishes a transport regime where magnetic connectivity between sources and the solar neighborhood determines the local flux. Active sources aligned with local GMF lines, such as Cygnus X-1, exhibit significant flux enhancements, while magnetically disconnected sources, such as V616 Mon, are strongly suppressed. By integrating source evolution with anisotropic transport, we show that the observed proton bump at the CR “knee&quot; is best reproduced by the cumulative contribution of microquasar remnants, which is often dominated by a few nearby or recent events, rather than the active ones alone. We find that a harder injection spectrum allows CRs from remnants to reproduce the PeV bump after propagation, as low-energy CRs have sufficient time to accumulate while high-energy CRs escape the Galactic plane. Our findings suggest that the integrated history of microquasar remnants, governed by the interplay of source age and magnetic connectivity, is the primary driver populating the observed CR “knee”.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Robust Interstellar Meteor Candidates in the Post-2018 CNEOS Fireball Database</a><span class="id">[2602.08956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the identification of two previously unrecognized interstellar meteor candidates in the NASA CNEOS fireball database.

Two post-2018 events have heliocentric speeds robustly exceeding the Solar System escape speed. CNEOS-22 (2022-07-28; 6.0$^\circ$S, 86.9$^\circ$W; eastern tropical Pacific) has $v_{\rm hel}=46.98$ km s$^{-1}$, exceeding escape by $\Delta = 5.18 \pm 0.60$ km s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\Delta}=8.7\sigma$), with interstellar speed $v_{\infty,\odot}=21.5$ km s$^{-1}$. CNEOS-25 (2025-02-12; 73.4$^\circ$N, 49.3$^\circ$E; Barents Sea) has $v_{\rm hel}=45.63$ km s$^{-1}$, exceeding escape by $\Delta = 3.22 \pm 0.58$ km s$^{-1}$ ($z_{\Delta}=5.5\sigma$), with $v_{\infty,\odot}=16.9$ km s$^{-1}$.

No significant change in flux at $\gtrsim15$ $\mu$m is detected in the spectra. Comparing the MIRI/MRS spectrum and NEOWISE photometry, we found that this $\leq10$ $\mu$m flux increase occurs on a timescale of 2 weeks and is consistent with the presence of warm (1,400 K), optically thick, large ($\gtrsim1$ $\mu$m) dust grains near the dust sublimation radius.

I. A decoupling between granulation and oscillation timescales for dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2602.08978]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Granulation is the observable signature of convection in envelopes of low-mass stars, forming the background in stellar power spectra. While well-studied in evolved giants, granulation on the MS has received less attention. We here study and characterise granulation signatures of MS and SGB stars, extending previous studies of giants to provide a continuous physical picture across evolutionary stages. We analyse 753 Kepler short-cadence stars using a Bayesian nested-sampling framework to evaluate three background descriptions and compare model preferences. This yields full posterior distributions for all parameters, enabling robust comparisons across a diverse stellar sample. No universal preference between background models is found. Assuming a Gaussian oscillation envelope, $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ estimates are sensitive to model misspecification, with the resulting systematics exceeding the formal uncertainties. The envelope width scales with $\nu_\mathrm{max}$ across models and shows a dependence on effective temperature. Total granulation amplitudes in dwarfs broadly follow giant-based scalings, however a decoupling appears between the timescale of the primary granulation and the oscillations for MS stars cooler than the Sun. The prolonged granulation timescale is reproduced by 3D simulations of a K-dwarf, driven by reduced convective velocities due to more efficient convective energy transport in denser envelopes. The prolonged granulation timescale increases the frequency separation to the oscillation excess, potentially aiding seismic detectability, while the reduced convective velocities may influence the excitation of stellar oscillations and relate to the low amplitudes observed in cool dwarfs. Finally, we contribute a dataset linking granulation, oscillations, and stellar parameters, providing a foundation for future investigations into their interdependence across the HR diagram.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evaluating the $Σ$-effect Model of the Solar Hemispherical Helicity Bias via Direct Numerical Simulations</a><span class="id">[2602.08992]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Solar Hemispherical Helicity Rule(s) (SHHR) is a term used to represent a bias observed in proxies for the magnetic helicity in active regions at the solar surface. The SHHR states that predominantly negative magnetic helicity is observed in active regions in the northern hemisphere, whereas predominantly positive is found in the southern. The $\Sigma$-effect model of \cite{longcope1998flux} is one of the most cited models for the explanation of the SHHR. In this model, the magnetic structures derive the bias in their magnetic helicity from the kinetic helicity of the turbulent convection through which they travel, where the latter is handed owing to the rotational influence of the star. The original paper built an elegant mathematical model for the dynamics of thin flux tubes influenced by parameterized helical turbulence. Here, we attempt to explore the conceptual ideas of this original simplified model using fully-nonlinear, three-dimensional, Cartesian-domain simulations of isolated, finite cross-sectional, twisted magnetic flux structures rising though rotating, overshooting, turbulent compressible convection. We look for evidence of a correlation between the kinetic helicity content of the turbulence and the evolving magnetic helicity of the structures. We find little evidence of such a relationship, and do not even find any clear hemispheric dependence. Although these simulations are far from a perfect representation of the ideas, this work raises many questions about the potential efficacy of the $\Sigma$-effect in reality.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The seismic diversity of four successive solar cycle minima as observed by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON)</a><span class="id">[2602.09019]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have used data collected by the Birmingham Solar-Oscillations Network (BiSON) to perform a helioseismic diagnosis of changes to the Sun's internal structure between four successive solar cycle minima, beginning with the minimum at the end of cycle 21 and ending with the recent minimum at the beginning of cycle 25. The unique duration of the BiSON database makes such a study possible. We used the low-degree BiSON p-mode frequencies to constrain structural changes between minima in the layers above $\approx 0.9 R_{\odot}$. We accomplished this by examining variations in the HeII ionisation zone signature; and by inverting the frequency differences to infer changes in the sound speed. Additionally, we employed frequency differences between various solar models that had subtle modifications to their internal structures to facilitate analysis of the observations. We find evidence for small, but marginally significant, changes in structure between different minima. The HeII signature was larger, and the sound speed in the range $\approx 0.93$ to $0.97 R_{\odot}$ was slightly higher, during the cycle 23/24 minimum, than during the other minima. The cycle 23/24 minimum was the deepest, as measured by proxies of global solar activity. These findings are consistent with magnetic flux levels having been lower in this minimum than the others, resulting in a higher gas pressure, higher temperatures, and higher sound speed. Our results demonstrate the potential of using asteroseismic data to perform similar analyses on other solar-type stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Exploration of the Equation of State Dependence of Core-Collapse Supernova Explosion Outcomes and Signatures</a><span class="id">[2602.09025]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore, using a state-of-the-art simulation code in 3D and to late enough times to witness final observables, the dependence of core-collapse supernova explosions on the nuclear equation of state. Going beyond questions of explodability, we compare final explosion energies, nucleosynthetic yields, recoil kicks, and gravitational-wave and neutrino signatures using the SFHo and DD2 nuclear equations of state (EOS) for a 9-$M_{\odot}$/solar-metallicity progenitor star. The DD2 EOS is stiffer and has a lower effective nucleon mass. The result is a more extended protoneutron star (PNS) and lower central densities. As a consequence, the mean neutrino energies, final explosion energy, and recoil kick speed are lower. Moreover, the evolution of PNS convection differs between the two EOS models in significant ways. This translates in part into interestingly altered neutrino “light&quot; curves and noticeably altered gravitational-wave signal strengths and frequency characteristics that may be diagnostic. The faster exploding model (SFHo) yields slightly more neutron-rich ejecta and more species with atomic weights between 60 and 90 and a weak r-process. However, this is merely a preliminary study. The next step is a more comprehensive and multi-progenitor set of 3D supernova simulations for various EOSes to late times when the observables have asymptoted. Such a future investigation will have a direct bearing on the neutron star and black hole birth mass functions and the quest towards a fully quantitative theory of supernova observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotic Freedom and Vacuum Polarization Determine the Astrophysical End State of Relativistic Gravitational Collapse: Quark–Gluon Plasma Star Instead of Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2602.07004]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A general relativistic model of an astrophysical hypermassive extremely magnetized ultra-compact self-bound quark–gluon plasma object that is supported against its ultimate gravitational implosion by the simultaneous action of the vacuum polarization driven by nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED: light-by-light scattering) and the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) asymptotic freedom, is presented. These QCD stars can be the final figures of the equilibrium of collapsing stellar cores. Post-supernova fallback material pushes the nascent remnant beyond its stability to collapse into a hybrid hypermassive neutron star (HHMNS). Hypercritical accretion can unbind the whole HHMNS's baryons to spontaneously break away color confinement, powering a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition to a sea of ever-freer quarks and gluons. This core is hydro-stabilized by the steady, endlessly compression-admitting asymptotic freedom state, possibly via gluon-mediated enduring exchange of color charge among bound states. The nonlinear TOV equation indicates the occurrence of hypermassive QGP/QCD stars with a wide mass spectrum ($0\lesssim$ M$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim$ 7 M$_\odot$ and beyond), for star radii ($0\lesssim R^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}}\lesssim 24$ km and beyond) with B-fields ($10^{14} \leq$ B$^{\rm{QGP}}_{\rm{Star}} \leq 10^{16}$ G and beyond). Such QCD stars can emulate what the true black holes are supposed to gravitationally do in most astrophysical settings. This color quark star could be found through a search for its eternal “yo-yo” state gravitational-wave emission, or via lensing phenomena like gravitational rainbows, as in this scenario it is expected that the light deflection angle, directly influenced by the larger effective mass/radius and magnetic field of the deflecting object, increases as the incidence angle decreases for impact parameter lower values.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning-Ready Data Sets for the Analysis and Nowcasting of Atmospheric Radiation at Aviation Altitudes</a><span class="id">[2602.07108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment in the Earth's lower atmosphere are critical for the safety of aircraft and spacecraft crews and passengers. Currently, this problem is addressed by employing statistical and physics-based models that take into account particle transport and precipitation. However, given the increased number of radiation measurements available to the community, it is possible to start developing data-driven approaches. We prepared Machine Learning-ready (ML-ready) datasets to nowcast the effective dose rates at aviation altitudes. The presented datasets contain 92,476 individual measurements from 589 flights obtained by the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) experiment from 2013 to 2023. The ARMAS measurements are augmented with the properties of the Geospace environment, such as solar soft X-ray and proton fluxes, solar wind properties, secondary cosmic ray neutrons, space weather indexes, and global solar activity indicators (such as daily sunspot number). ARMAS data are separated into three partitions, ensuring that (1) the data points from a single flight remain within the same partition, and (2) each partition samples the flight locations and Geospace environment conditions equally. Several versions of the datasets allow predictions based on point-in-time measurements and use up to 24 hours of Geospace parameter history. The test of the use case demonstrates a possibility of nowcasting ARMAS measurements with accuracies slightly better than the considered physics-based models. The publicly available ML-ready datasets could serve as the first step in data preparation for ML-driven nowcasting and forecasting of the radiation environment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutron Stars as Perfect Fluids: Extracting the Linearized Response Function</a><span class="id">[2602.07115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the general relativistic linear tidal response of a neutron star modeled as a barotropic perfect fluid.

When this breaking occurs dynamically in the early Universe, stable domain wall networks are formed, which can eventually dominate the cosmic energy density. To avoid this problem, explicit $\mathcal{Z}_2$-breaking terms in the scalar potential are usually introduced in an ad hoc manner. In this Letter, we show that if the same $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is also responsible for generating light Dirac neutrino masses, such explicit breaking terms can instead arise radiatively from the particles involved in the Dirac mass generation. We find that the resulting bias term scales inversely with the cube of the Dirac neutrino mass, leading to a gravitational wave spectrum proportional to the sixth power of the Dirac neutrino mass. This establishes a nontrivial connection between the Dirac seesaw scale, the domain wall annihilation epoch, and the resulting stochastic gravitational wave signal. We further demonstrate that a wide range of Dirac seesaw scales can be probed by upcoming gravitational wave and cosmic microwave background experiments, while part of the parameter space simultaneously explains the observed baryon asymmetry via Dirac leptogenesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07939" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New solution to the hyperon puzzle of neutron stars: Quantum many-body effects</a><span class="id">[2602.07939]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The hyperon puzzle refers to the challenge of reconciling the existence of hyperons in neutron star cores and the observed high masses of neutron stars. The recent discovery of PSR J0952-0607 ($2.35\pm0.17 M_{\odot}$) has intensified this challenge. Existing solutions fail to achieve such a high mass, and often predict unrealistically fast cooling that is at odds with observations. Here, we propose a novel solution to the hyperon puzzle. Using the Dyson-Schwinger equation approach, we incorporate the quantum many-body effects caused by strong baryon-meson interactions into the equation of state for cold baryonic matter and find it stiff enough to support a maximum hyperon-star mass of $M_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 2.59 M_{\odot}$, which can explain all the observed high neutron-star masses. The resulting proton and hyperon fractions are remarkably low, thus the nucleonic and hyperonic direct Urca processes are significantly suppressed. As a result, fast cooling typically does not occur in ordinary neutron stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can UV meet IR in the Swiss cheese?</a><span class="id">[2602.08487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider the embedding of regular black holes in an expanding universe and study how the ultraviolet modifications to the Schwarzschild geometry that regularize the black hole singularity affect the exterior universe's expansion rate.

The phenomenon of superradiance can convert the BH spin kinetic energy into a bound cloud of scalars. In this letter, we propose a new technique for directly measuring the mass of a dark cloud around a spinning BH. We compare the measurement of the BH spin obtained with two independent electromagnetic techniques: continuum fitting and iron K$\alpha$ spectroscopy. Since the former technique depends on a dynamical observation of the BH mass while the latter does not, a mismatch between the two measurements can be used to infer the presence of additional extended mass around the BH.

In particular, for very small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, current limits come exclusively from investigations of the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBH radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after their evaporation. Recent findings also indicate that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}~\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, thereby affecting the primordial abundance of light nuclei. Moreover, it has been proposed that the “memory burden” effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black holes, allowing light PBHs to survive until the present day.

While this framework applies to the entire cosmic ray spectrum, in this work, we focus on its implications for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We perform a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to investigate the power processed at shocks around clusters and filaments. The downstream flux from nearby shocks around the local filament accounts for the softer, lower-energy extragalactic component around the ankle, and the upstream escaping flux from nearby clusters accounts for the transition to a hard spectral component at the highest energies. This interpretation is in agreement with UHECR observations. We suggest that a combination of early-Universe galactic outflows, cosmic ray streaming instabilities, and a small-scale turbulent dynamo can increase magnetic fields enough to attain the required rigidities. Our simulation suggests that the available volume-averaged power density of accretion shocks exceeds the required UHECR luminosity density by three orders of magnitude. We show that microgauss magnetic fields at these shocks could explain both the origin of UHECRs and potentially contribute to the diffuse radio synchrotron background below 10 GHz. The shock-accelerated electrons produce a hard radio background without overproducing diffuse inverse Compton emission. These results motivate further observational tests with upcoming facilities to help distinguish accretion shocks from other UHECR sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Evidence of Spin Energy Extraction from Black Holes</a><span class="id">[2504.05600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic jets have been found for decades as a key phenomenon in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), compact binary systems, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), yet their energy resources remain a mystery.

We propose that BHs remnant from their natal GRB activity can serve as a critical testbed to discriminate between these two scenarios. Via analytical approaches, we demonstrate that extraction of rotational energy to power jets during the GRB phase drives the remnant BH to a universal equilibrium spin, independent of accretion history, initial spin, and mass. This model predicts a stellar-mass BH population with this universal spin, a hallmark of BH spin energy extraction. Testing against the 4th gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0), we find a statistically robust dominant population where secondary BH spins are narrowly centered at $\sim0.05$. These findings provide strong new evidence for BH spin energy extraction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19059" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effective Field Theory of Chiral Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2504.19059]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When a (non-)Abelian gauge field acquires an isotropic background configuration during inflation, strong gravitational waves (GWs) with parity-violating polarization, known as chiral GWs, can be produced in addition to the intrinsic unpolarized GWs. However, previous studies have analyzed individual models, leaving the generality of this phenomenon unclear. To perform a model-independent analysis, we construct an effective field theory (EFT) of chiral GWs by extending the EFT of inflation and incorporating gauge fields. The resulting action unifies inflationary models with a $SU(2)$ gauge field, such as chromo-natural inflation and gauge-flation, and ones with a triplet of $U(1)$ gauge fields, systematically encompassing all possible GW production mechanisms consistent with the symmetry breaking induced by the gauge field background. We find that chiral GWs are generically and inevitably produced, provided that the effective energy density of the background gauge field is positive and the gauge kinetic function is not fine-tuned to a specific time dependence. This EFT offers a useful foundation for future phenomenological studies as well as for deepening our theoretical understanding of chiral GWs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10395" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LVK S241125n: Massive Binary Black Hole Merger Produces Gamma Ray Burst in Active Galactic Nucleus Disk</a><span class="id">[2505.10395]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the gravitational-wave (GW) event S241125n, detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK), has been reported to coincide with a candidate detected by Swift-BAT/GUANO and an X-ray candidate found by FXT onboard of Einstein Probe (EP) and confirmed by Swift-XRT. We estimate that the joint false alarm rate (FAR) for the three candidates is 1 / 30 yr and that the corresponding false alarm probability (FAP) is $\mathrm{FAP}_{\rm triple} = 0.037$ ($1.8 \sigma$). The coincidence between the GW and GRB could be an interesting test of their origin and open attractive opportunities for multi-messenger observations, if they are actually associated. Motivated by this, we propose a theoretical model in which a binary black hole (BBH) merger occurs within an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk. The typically massive and significantly kicked merger remnant accretes disk material at hyper-Eddington rates, and the resulting jet could lead to the GRB associated with the GW event. As the jet interacts with the gas in the AGN disk, the shock breakout produces a Comptonized spectrum, consistent with an unusually soft photon index of the GRB prompt emission observed by Swift-BAT following LVK S241125n. Meanwhile, strong absorption and dust extinction of the afterglow by the high column density typical of AGN disks could explain the unusually hard spectrum observed in the X-ray band by EP, as well as the non-detection of an optical counterpart. Our model is predictive, and we highlight the importance of further constraining the orbital eccentricity of the merger and conducting deep-field observations of the host galaxy to test our explanation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for a sign change of the ISW effect in the very recent universe: hot voids and cold overdensities at $z&lt;0.03$</a><span class="id">[2506.08832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We find a significant CMB temperature excess in the direction of local underdensities within $z&lt;0.03$.

We explore two limiting magnetic field configurations, parallel and perpendicular to the bulk flow, and simulate their expected polarization signatures using the 3DPol radiative transport code. To account for the rapid rotation of the polarization angle predicted by these models, we implement a phase-dependent Stokes alignment procedure that preserves the polarization degree while correcting for a phase-rotating PA. We also devise a new maximum-likelihood fitting strategy to determine the phase-dependence of the polarization angle by minimizing the polarization degree uncertainty. This technique hints that the binary may be rotating clockwise relative to the celestial north pole.

We implemented transfer learning with a pretrained ConvNext architecture, exploiting its powerful feature extraction ability. ConvNext was adapted to classify dedispersed dynamic spectra (which we treat as images) of the FRBs into one of the two sub-classes, i.e., repeater and non-repeater, based on their various temporal and spectral properties and relation between the sub-pulse structures. Additionally, we also used mathematical model representation of the total intensity data to interpret the deep learning model. Upon fine-tuning the pretrained ConvNext on the FRB spectrograms, we were able to achieve high classification metrics while substantially reducing training time and computing power as compared to training a deep learning model from scratch with random weights and biases without any feature extraction ability. Importantly, our results suggest that the morphological differences between CHIME repeating and non-repeating events persist in Catalog 2 and the deep learning model leveraged these differences for classification. The fine-tuned deep learning model can be used for inference, which enables us to predict whether an FRB's morphology resembles that of repeaters or non-repeaters. Such inferences may become increasingly significant when trained on larger data sets that will exist in the near future.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13593" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI DR1 Ly$α$ 1D power spectrum: Validation of estimators</a><span class="id">[2509.13593]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Data Release 1 (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) is the largest sample to date for small-scale Ly$\alpha$ forest cosmology, accessed through its one-dimensional power spectrum ($P_{\mathrm{1D}}$). The Ly$\alpha$ forest $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ is extracted from quasar spectra that are highly inhomogeneous (both in wavelength and between quasars) in noise properties due to intrinsic properties of the quasar, atmospheric and astrophysical contamination, and also sensitive to low-level details of the spectral extraction pipeline. We employ two estimators in DR1 analysis to measure $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$: the optimal estimator and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) estimator. To ensure robustness of our DR1 measurements, we validate these two power spectrum and covariance matrix estimation methodologies against the challenging aspects of the data. First, using a set of 20 synthetic 1D realizations of DR1, we derive the masking bias corrections needed for the FFT estimator and the continuum fitting bias needed for both estimators. We demonstrate that both estimators, including their covariances, are unbiased with these corrections using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Second, we substantially extend our previous suite of CCD image simulations to include 675,000 quasars, allowing us to accurately quantify the pipeline's performance. This set of simulations reveals biases at the highest $k$ values, corresponding to a resolution error of a few percent. We base the resolution systematics error budget of DR1 $P_{\mathrm{1D}}$ on these values, but do not derive corrections from them since the simulation fidelity is insufficient for precise corrections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">69.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A multiwavelength study of the Galactic center black hole candidate MAXI J1744-294</a><span class="id">[2509.14465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For the first time in nearly a decade, a bright transient was detected in the central parsec (pc) of the Galaxy.

Our results show that extremely high luminosity due to the Schwinger process and insufficient thermal conductivity of quarks leads to development of steep temperature gradient at the surface of strange star.

However, the smoking-gun observational evidence of the fireball is elusive. We envisage that the fireball emission should occasionally be eclipsed by the magnetar, especially when the burst duration is comparable to the magnetar's spin period. In this work, we first discover a peculiar type of burst whose light curve has a plateau-like feature among the long bursts of the magnetar SGR J1935+2154 detected by GECAM and Fermi/GBM. Then, based on these bursts, we identified four burst candidates with eclipse-like characteristics. By fitting their light curves with the eclipse fireball model, the viewing angle of the magnetar relative to its spin axis is estimated to be $17^\circ \pm 10^\circ$, and the distances from the fireballs to the magnetar are found to be more than 5 times the magnetar's radius, indicating that the fireballs are suspended in the magnetosphere rather than adhering to the magnetar surface. Furthermore, we find this configuration is well consistent with the implication of the cyclotron resonance scattering feature we found in their spectra. Our results suggest that some intermediate X-ray bursts may originate from magnetic reconnection within the magnetosphere rather than the starquake.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar photospheric velocities measured in space: a comparison between SO/PHI-HRT and SDO/HMI</a><span class="id">[2510.25515]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI) onboard Solar Orbiter is a spectropolarimeter scanning the Fe I line at 617.3 nm, providing data of the solar photosphere.

In this paper, we aim at assessing the consistency between line-of-sight (LoS) velocity measurements from the two instruments. Reliable measurements of up and down flows from SO/PHI are crucial and unique when Solar Orbiter is facing the far side of the Sun. Also, a combination of measurements from two vantage points to study horizontal flows must rely on consistent observations. For this purpose, we compare the LoS velocity measured by SO/PHI's High Resolution Telescope (SO/PHI-HRT) and SDO/HMI on 29 March 2023, when Solar Orbiter was crossing the Sun-Earth line at a distance of 0.39 au from the Sun. Because such co-alignments are rare, this configuration offered an almost unique opportunity to directly compare data products from both telescopes. The data are aligned and remapped to allow a pixel-by-pixel comparison of the whole time series of 4 hours length. Temporal and spatial variations are considered for a direct combination of the measurements. The LoS velocity distributions are evaluated and a clear linear relation is found between the two instruments with a slope of 0.96 and a correlation of 92%. We find that the signals form at similar heights, with a separation of 7$\pm$14 km, which is larger than previous estimates. A close-up look at the penumbra of a sunspot and its Evershed flow is presented.

It is obtained by combining quiet coronagraph observations, with synthetic white-light CMEs produced using the GCS geometric model and ray-tracing technique. We found that our model-based trained Mask R-CNN infers segmentation masks that are smooth and topologically connected. While the inferred masks are not representative of the detailed outer envelope of complex CMEs, the neural model can better differentiate a CME from other radially moving background/foreground features, segment multiple simultaneous CMEs that are close to each other, and work with images from different instruments. This is accomplished without relying on kinematic information, i.e. only the included in the single input difference image. We obtain a median IoU=0.98 for 1.6*10^4 synthetic validation images, and IoU=0.77 when compared with two independent manual segmentations of 115 observations acquired by the COR2-A, COR2-B and LASCO C2 coronagraphs. The methodology presented in this work can be used with other CME models to produce more realistic synthetic brightness images while preserving desired morphological features, and obtain more robust and/or tailored segmentations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turnover detection using the power spectrum and bispectrum</a><span class="id">[2511.06962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The turnover at the peak of the Fourier matter power spectrum encodes a fundamental signature of matter-radiation equality in the early Universe. This delivers a potential standard ruler, independent of baryon acoustic oscillations and therefore able to break parameter degeneracies and improve precision. Furthermore, the turnover scale is independent of redshift and clustering bias, allowing for stacking of the signals from redshift bins. In practice, the very large scale of the turnover means that sample variance and systematics are serious impediments to its detection. Detections of the turnover and measurements of its scale have been made in the WiggleZ, eBOSS, Quaia, and DESI surveys. Upcoming surveys should improve the detection significance and reduce errors on the turnover scale. We use MCMC forecasts for turnover detection in a spectroscopic Euclid-like survey and a futuristic MegaMapper-like survey. In addition to the power spectrum, we include the signal from the bispectrum in equilateral configurations. These surveys are forecast to detect the turnover at $\sim\! 6\sigma$ (Euclid-like) and $\sim\! 15\sigma$ (MegaMapper-like), with precision on the turnover scale of $\sim\! 4\%$ and $\sim\! 2\%$. The inclusion of the bispectrum delivers a modest improvement of $\sim\! 10-17\%$ in the constraints on the turnover scale.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter from Holography</a><span class="id">[2511.10617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Previous studies have examined the holographic principle as a means of producing dark energy. Here we propose instead the possibility of holographic dark matter. In this case, dark matter does not arise in the framework of particle physics but is derived from the infrared cutoff set by the horizon scale. Using the Ricci cutoff, and a universe containing only baryons and radiation, we can account for the dark matter and naturally explain the coincidence between baryonic and nonbaryonic contributions to the density. In the presence of a pre-existing vacuum energy density our model reverses the sign of this density, thus accounting for the fact that certain string theories generically predict a negative vacuum energy, but observations require a positive value.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23018" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExoJAX Retrievals of VLT/CRIRES Spectra of Luhman 16AB: C/O Ratios and Systematic Uncertainties</a><span class="id">[2511.23018]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present atmospheric retrievals of the benchmark brown dwarf binary Luhman 16AB using high-resolution VLT/CRIRES spectra and the differentiable framework ExoJAX.

We first perform retrievals with a power-law $T$-$P$ profile and assess the sensitivity of inferred molecular abundances and C/O ratios to different CO line lists (ExoMol, HITEMP with air- and H2-broadening). We then introduce a flexible Gaussian process-based $T$-$P$ profile, allowing a non-parametric characterization of the thermal structure and a more conservative treatment of uncertainties. For both components, we infer C/O ratios of about 0.67, slightly above solar, with line list systematics at the 7 percent level emerging as the dominant source of uncertainty, whereas assumptions about $T$-$P$ parameterization or photometric variability play a lesser role. The retrieved $T$-$P$ profiles and molecular abundances are broadly consistent with atmospheric models and equilibrium chemistry. Our results establish Luhman 16AB as a key anchor for substellar C/O measurements, demonstrate the utility of flexible $T$-$P$ modeling in high-resolution retrievals, and highlight the importance of systematic tests – particularly line list uncertainties – for robust comparisons between brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of the Inner Accretion Flow in Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across Intermediate States: Insights from Broadband Spectral and Timing Analysis</a><span class="id">[2512.05544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive broadband spectral and variability study of the newly detected black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8–1613 in the intermediate states during its 2023 outburst, using multi-mission observations from NICER, NuSTAR, AstroSat, and Insight-HXMT. Spectral data up to 78 keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) require models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk in the SIMS moves substantially closer to the innermost stable circular orbit, accompanied by a significant rise in disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\sim1.3$ to $\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component and assuming the distance of 3.4 kpc, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.3^{+5.5}_{-2.5}~M_\odot$, spin of $0.79^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$, and the disk inclination angle of $\sim37\degr$–$53\degr$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. We find a weakly variable or stable disk and a highly variable Comptonized component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intergalactic magnetic field lower limits up to the redshift $z\approx3$</a><span class="id">[2512.11397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-scale intergalactic magnetic fields may contain a mixture of galactic and cosmogenic contributions, that can be probed via observations of $\gamma$-ray &quot;echo&quot; - a delayed emission from electromagnetic cascades initiated by the highest energy photons from the sources at cosmological distances. While these fields contributions may be disentangled based on the difference in their redshift evolution, thus far indications of non-negligible magnetic field have been found only at low redshifts. This work aims at extending the intergalactic magnetic field constraints to redshifts $z\gtrsim 1$ using 17-year long all-sky observations of high-redshift active galactic nuclei with Fermi/LAT $\gamma$-ray telescope. Combing the Fermi/LAT measurements in the 0.1 GeV - 1 TeV energy range with the Monte Carlo simulations of the $\gamma$-ray &quot;echo&quot;, it is shown that the zero field strength hypothesis at $z = [0.5; 3]$ is disfavoured at the $\approx 8.6\sigma$ significance level, yielding the lower limit of $B \gtrsim 1\times10^{-18}$ cG for the magnetic field correlation length above 1 Mpc. It is further shown that the same data put a lower limit on the volume-filling fraction of this field of $f\gtrsim 90\%$ in the redshift range considered. It is also demonstrated that the derived limits are not substantially affected by either source flux variability or the assumed $\gamma$-ray emission attenuation model. Implications of these limits for intergalactic magnetic field origin are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.05512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present empirical evidence extracted directly from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. To show this, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration using Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=(t/t_0)^\mu$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_0a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The new model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\mu^{-1}c_0t_0\,da/dt$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ carries profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) a resolution to the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalized cosmological principle into the time domain; and (v) a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\propto da/dt$ relation represents a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy, a requirement that the $\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill. Thus, our paper delivers the clearest and most decisive evidence to date that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of cosmology and calls for variable-$c$ modifications to General Relativity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotic power spectra and visibilities of damped mixed modes</a><span class="id">[2601.21745]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observational studies of red giant stars have estimated the visibility of their mixed oscillation modes, which is a proxy of the average energy of these modes. Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Variable-Slope Smooth-$k$ Filter for Modeling Halo Abundances with Damped and Oscillatory Power Spectra</a><span class="id">[2602.01320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce a variable-slope smooth-$k$ (VSMK) filter within the Press-Schechter formalism to model halo mass functions derived from damped and oscillatory matter power spectra. While the standard smooth-$k$ approach successfully captures small-scale suppression effects, it intrinsically couples these to oscillatory features at intermediate scales. The VSMK filter generalizes this framework by allowing the effective logarithmic slope of the $k$-space window function to vary smoothly between two asymptotic regimes, thereby decoupling the small-scale suppression of halo abundances from the intermediate-scale oscillatory features characteristic of dark acoustic oscillations. We compare the analytic predictions obtained with the VSMK filter to $N$-body simulations for warm dark matter and ETHOS-based models, showing that a single parameter set reproduces both regimes simultaneously. The VSMK filter thus provides a unified and flexible analytic framework for modeling halo abundances in non-cold dark matter scenarios with damped and oscillatory power spectra.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01911" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulation-based cosmological inference from optically-selected galaxy clusters with $\texttt{Capish}$</a><span class="id">[2602.01911]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters are powerful probes of the growth of cosmic structure through measurements of their abundance as a function of mass and redshift. Extracting precise cosmological constraints from cluster surveys is challenging, as we must contend the complex relationship between richness and the underlying halo mass, selection function biases, super-sample covariance, and correlated measurement noise between mass proxies. As upcoming photometric surveys are expected to detect tens to hundreds of thousands of galaxy clusters, controlling these systematics becomes essential. In this paper, we present a forward-modelling approach using Simulation-Based Inference (SBI), which provides a natural framework for jointly modelling cluster abundance and lensing mass observables while capturing systematic uncertainties at higher fidelity than analytic likelihood methods - which rely on simplifying assumptions such as fixed covariances and Gaussianity - without requiring an explicit likelihood formulation. We introduce $\texttt{Capish}$, a Python code for generating forward-modelled galaxy cluster catalogues using halo mass functions and incorporating observational effects. We perform SBI using neural density estimation with normalizing flows, trained on abundance and mean lensing mass measurements in observed redshift-richness bins. Our forward model accounts for realistic noise, redshift uncertainties, selection functions, and correlated scatter between lensing mass and observed richness. We find good agreement with likelihood-based analyses, with broader SBI posteriors reflecting the increased realism of the forward model. We also test $\texttt{Capish}$ on cluster catalogues built from a large cosmological simulation, finding a good fit to cosmological parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">88.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A case for Case A: detailed look at binary black hole formation through stable mass transfer</a><span class="id">[2602.03629]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In isolated binary evolution, binary black hole (BBH) mergers are generally formed through stable mass transfer (SMT) or common envelope evolution. In recent years, the SMT channel has received significant attention due to detailed binary models showing increased mass transfer stability compared to previous studies. In this work, we perform a full zero-age-main-sequence to compact object merger analysis using detailed binary models at eight metallicities between $10^{-4}Z_\odot$ and $2Z_\odot$ to self-consistently model the population properties of BBH mergers in the SMT channel, determined their progenitor initial conditional, and investigate the binary physics governing their formation and metallicity dependence. We use the population synthesis code POSYDON to determine the population of BBH mergers from SMT. Using its extended grids of MESA binary models, we determine the essential physics in the formation of BBH mergers. SMT produces BBH mergers predominantly from systems with $P_{ZAMS}\leq10$ days. In these systems, both the initial mass transfer between two stars and the subsequent interaction between the remaining star and the first-born BH take place while the respective donor star is on the main-sequence (Case A). We find a limited contribution from wider Case B/C systems. Without a natal kick, the SMT channel does not produce BBH mergers above $Z&gt;0.2Z_\odot$ due to orbital widening from stellar wind mass loss. The primary BH mass distribution shows a strong dependence on metallicity, while the mass ratio prefers unity independent of metallicity due to mass ratio reversal. Additionally, the $\chi_{eff}$ distributions contain peaks at $\chi_{eff}=0$ and  0.15 of which the former disappears at high metallicities. A mass-scaled natal kick leave this sub-population unchanged but introduce a low-mass, unequal mass ratio sub-population that merges due to their high eccentricity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microlensing constraints on Primordial Black Hole abundance with Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam observations of Andromeda</a><span class="id">[2602.05840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present updated microlensing analysis results based on high-cadence ($\sim$2 min) Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations of the Andromeda Galaxy (M31) in 2014, 2017, and 2020, yielding a total of 39.3 hours of data. We use a point-lens finite-source model for the microlensing light curve model and employ multi-stage selection procedures to identify microlensing candidates. From more than 25,000 variable candidates detected across all nights, we identify 12 microlensing candidates with light-curve timescales shorter than 5 hours, and among them, 4 secure candidates with high-significance detections. We estimate detection efficiencies using light-curve-level simulations that account for observational conditions and finite-source effects. Using a hierarchical Bayesian framework that combines the light-curve fitting information for each candidate with the Poisson statistics of the number of candidates, we derive constraints on parameters that characterize the abundance and mass scale of primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter. First, we derive upper limits on the PBH abundance under the null hypothesis that all events are assumed to be false detections. Next, employing the PBH hypothesis in which all (or only secure) candidates are assumed to be due to PBH microlensing, we derive the allowed region of the PBH parameters; the inferred mass scale is $M_{\rm PBH}\sim10^{-7}$–$10^{-6}M_\odot$, and the PBH abundance to the total dark matter is $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-1}$. Our results demonstrate that HSC-M31 monitoring remains a uniquely powerful probe of PBHs, and highlight the need for further studies for example, using Rubin Observatory LSST observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">90.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in stellar radiative regions.

We focus on shear-driven instabilities, specifically the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability and the magnetorotational instability (MRI), which are expected to play key roles in the internal dynamics of radiative regions. We carried out a local linear stability analysis using a numerical approach that extends beyond classical limiting cases and includes stabilizing effects such as stratification and magnetic tension, allowing the exploration of realistic flow regimes. These results were validated through a global mode analysis in a Taylor-Couette configuration. We recovered the standard MRI and azimuthal MRI stability criteria and quantified the effects of stratification, magnetic tension, and diffusion on their growth. In strongly sheared regimes, we derived a new criterion for the magnetised GSF (MGSF) instability and clarified the transition from SMRI to MGSF as stratification and magnetic effects narrow the unstable domain. We also provided approximate growth-time formulae that identify the dominant instability under given stellar conditions and can be implemented in 1D stellar evolution codes. Global Taylor-Couette calculations validate the local WKB analysis. Applied to subgiants and young red giants, our results show that shear-driven instabilities can grow rapidly for magnetic fields below 100 kG. Strong axial fields (100 kG) confined to the hydrogen-burning shell suppress instabilities unless the shear is sufficiently distant. These results support incorporating our criteria and growth estimates into stellar evolution models to assess the efficiency of shear-driven transport.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting stochastic inflation with perturbation theory</a><span class="id">[2311.17644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A long-standing problem in primordial cosmology is to understand the precise relation between the stochastic formalism and standard perturbation theory for light scalar fields in inflationary spacetimes.

We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">95.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intermediate mass-ratio inspirals in a dense dark-matter environment: Effects of the initial dark-matter distribution</a><span class="id">[2508.21132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent work has shown the possibility of detecting dense dark-matter distributions surrounding intermediate or extreme mass-ratio inspirals through gravitational waves using LISA. Modeling these systems requires evolving the coupled dynamics of the binary and the dark matter. This also requires setting reasonable initial conditions for the dark-matter distribution, which itself relies upon understanding the formation history of these systems. In this paper, we investigate how two aspects of these systems' formation histories shape the dark-matter distribution: accretion onto the primary and prior merger events. We model accretion by introducing a minimum allowed angular momentum of dark-matter particles, which removes such particles that would have been accreted by the primary. When simulating an inspiral within such a distribution, we find a smaller dephasing of the gravitational-wave signal from a vacuum binary as compared to an inspiral without such a cutoff, particularly for more extreme mass-ratios. We also simulate an inspiral which takes place within a dark-matter distribution that remains after a prior merger. We find that the decrease in dephasing from vacuum binaries when compared to the prior inspiral is most significant for less extreme mass-ratios. Nevertheless, the environmental effects from the dark matter for these different cases of initial data are still expected to be measurable by future space-based detectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">96.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational radiation reaction around a static black hole surrounded by a Dehnen type dark matter halo</a><span class="id">[2509.08569]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider the motion of a particle in the geometry of a Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo with Dehnen type density profile and calculate the orbital periods along with the evolution of the semi-latus rectum and eccentricity for extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs).

For magnetized configurations, the resulting WH+NS systems can become extremely massive, with ADM masses exceeding $8\,M_\odot$, and can exhibit large surface redshifts exceeding $z \simeq 1.5$. Furthermore, we analyze the gravitational-wave echo time of the systems, which serves as a potential observational imprint. Our results indicate that the echo time can vary depending on the fluid anisotropy and the magnetic field configuration, suggesting that WH+NS systems may provide distinctive signals of gravitational echo.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">99.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03620" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On flying through the base of a pseudo-streamer</a><span class="id">[2601.03620]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Near the 10 solar radius perihelion of Parker Solar Probe orbit 24, a confined region containing an enhanced plasma density of 25,000 particles per cubic centimeter and broadband electrostatic waves was encountered. The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">100.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viable f(R) Scenarios Unifying Inflation with Realistic Dynamical Dark Energy</a><span class="id">[2601.06949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Two $F(R)$ gravity models are tested on the basis of their viability during all stages of cosmological evolution. It is shown that these models can describe both the early-time inflationary epoch and the dark energy epoch. The models are confronted with the latest observational data, including the Pantheon+ catalogue with Type Ia supernovae, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations, the Hubble parameter estimations and data from cosmic microwave background radiation. Investigation of the viability conditions for these models, in particular, the condition $\frac{dF}{dR}&gt;0$ required a deep analysis. Both models appeared to be viable during the early-time era, but for the late-time evolution the viability conditions are not fulfilled in definite domains in the parameter spaces of these models. However the best fitted parameters, determined in confrontation with the mentioned observational data, lie far from the forbidden domains for both models. These $F(R)$ gravity models describe the observations with the large advantage over the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model, not only in $\chi^2$ statistics, but also with Akaike and Bayesian information criteria. This success of the two $F(R)$ gravity scenarios is connected with their capability to mimic dynamical dark energy, similarly to models with variable equation of state, that is necessary for describing the latest Pantheon+ and DESI observational data.</p></div></details></article></body>
