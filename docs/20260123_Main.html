However, their large spatial extent and intrinsically underdense environments make their identification highly sensitive to shot noise, redshift-space distortions (RSD), and observational systematics, particularly for topological and density-based void definitions. We introduce the Back-In-Time Void Finder (BitVF), a novel dynamical and physically motivated algorithm that identifies cosmic voids as regions of negative divergence of the Lagrangian displacement field reconstructed from the present-day tracer distribution. The reconstruction relies on an optimized discrete optimal transport algorithm that recovers the backward-in-time dynamics of tracers, naturally accounting for tracer bias without relying on cosmological assumptions. We validate BitVF against the widely used topological void finder REVOLVER using high-resolution N-body simulations, showing that it produces void catalogs with smoother and more physically motivated density profiles, as well as abundances that are more stable under tracer subsampling and shot noise. We further apply it to realistic DESI-like mock light-cone galaxy catalogs, demonstrating that it intrinsically mitigates redshift-space systematic effects, preserving real-space void size functions more faithfully than topological methods. Modeling RSD, the reconstruction can be combined with a fiducial cosmology and an assumed tracer bias within a bias-corrected Kaiser framework, yielding reconstructed-space void catalogs consistent with real-space statistics across redshift. Its performance is characterized as a function of the main internal parameters, showing an optimal balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and applicability to stage IV galaxy surveys. BitVF will be publicly released within the CosmoBolognaLib.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15400" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamic shocks powered by a wide, relativistic, super-Eddington outflow launched by an accreting neutron star in the mid-20th century</a><span class="id">[2601.15400]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accreting systems can launch powerful outflows which interact with the surrounding medium. We combine new radio observations of the accreting neutron star X-ray binary (XRB) Circinus X-1 (Cir X-1) with archival radio observations going back 24 years. The $\sim3$ pc scale wide-angle radio and X-ray emitting caps found around Cir X-1 are identified as synchrotron emitting shocks with significant proper motion and morphological evolution on decade timescales. Proper motion measurements of the shocks reveal they are mildly relativistic and decelerating, with apparent velocity of $0.14c\pm0.03c$ at a propagation distance of 2 pc. We demonstrate that these shocks are likely powered by a hidden relativistic ($\gtrsim0.3c$) wide-angle conical outflow launched in $1972\pm3$, in stark contrast to known structures around other XRBs formed by collimated jets over 1000s of years. The minimum time-averaged power of the outflow required to produce the observed synchrotron emission is $\sim0.1L_\text{Edd}$, while the time-averaged power required for the kinetic energy of the shocks is $\sim40 \left(\frac{n}{10^{-2} \text{cm}^{-3}}\right)L_\text{Edd}$, where $n$ is the average ambient medium number density. This reveals the outflow powering the shocks is likely significantly super-Eddington. We measure significant linear polarisation up to $52\pm6\%$ in the shocks demonstrating the presence of an ordered magnetic field of strength $\sim200~\mu\text{G}$. We show that the shocks are potential PeVatrons, capable of accelerating electrons to $\sim0.7~\text{PeV}$ and protons to $\sim20~\text{PeV}$, and we estimate the injection and energetic efficiencies of electron acceleration in the shocks. Finally, we predict that next generation gamma-ray facilities may be able to detect hadronic signatures from the shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spin-down changes in PSR B0540-69 induced by a drift of the magnetic axis</a><span class="id">[2601.15425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The dynamics of the solid crust + magnetic field lines of pulsars is a much debated issue, and remains unsettled after 50 years. Some pieces of evidence have emerged to complete and confirm theoretical calculations and expectations. We discuss in the present work an interpretation of the behavior of the ”Crab Twin” pulsar PSR B0540-69 in terms of the evolution of the magnetic field/quakes, connecting the behavior of the braking index with the underlying platelet drift and sudden discontinuous rearrangement (fast-slip) and long-term ones (slow-slip events), suggested by analogy with existing theoretical picture observed in the Earth's crust. The relationship of this scenario with permanent torque-changing glitches seen in the Crab and other young pulsars, and a set of similar events in the same object and others is addressed. We conclude that this physical approach is in principle consistent with all these sudden events, and point out future work to clarify the whole picture.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supernova interactions with aspherical circumstellar material I: calculations of light curves, AB magnitudes, spectra, and polarisation</a><span class="id">[2601.15428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an upgraded detailed numerical calculations of supernova (SN) interactions with significantly aspherical circumstellar matter (CSM), primarily formed as a disc or bipolar lobes. The circumstellar disc can arise as a result of, for example, mass transfer in a binary, while bipolar lobes can be the result of a violent pre-explosive ejection of matter, similar to the iconic cases of luminous blue variable stars (LBVs). We numerically simulate the radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) behaviour of interaction processes using a 2D cylindrical version of the RHD code CASTRO. We then calculate light curves, spectral patterns, and polarisation profiles, all up to a relatively long time of two years after an SN shock breakout and from different directions, using the multidimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer (MC-RT) codes SEDONA and SIROCCO. We calculated a total of five models for the two aforementioned configurations of the surrounding CSM, for stratified density levels, comparing the simulated hydrodynamic behaviour and differences in their observable properties. RHD models exhibit similar behaviour to previous adiabatic models, but with a significantly slower expansion velocity. The calculated light curves show a relatively smooth evolution in SN-disc interaction, and declines and brightening in SN-lobes interaction. Comparing models with real events with a presumed similar physical process provides guidance for selecting a more accurate CSM configuration when simulating real situations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15452" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The long quest for vacuum birefringence in magnetars: 1E 1547.0-5408 and the elusive smoking gun</a><span class="id">[2601.15452]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetars are now known to be among the most strongly polarized celestial sources in X-rays. Here we report on the $500\,\mathrm{ks}$ observation of the magnetar 1E 1547.0-5408 performed by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in March 2025. The IXPE spectrum is well reproduced by a single thermal component with blackbody temperature $kT_\mathrm{BB}\sim 0.67\,\mathrm{keV}$ and emission radius $R_\mathrm{BB}\sim 1.2\,\mathrm{km}$. The source exhibits a high linear polarization degree in the $2$–$6\,\mathrm{keV}$ band ($\mathrm{PD}=47.7\pm2.9\%$) with polarization angle $\mathrm{PA}=75^\circ.8 \pm 1.^\circ8$, measured West of celestial North. While $\mathrm{PA}$ does not appear to vary with energy, there is some evidence (at the $1\sigma$ confidence level) of a minimum in $\mathrm{PD}$ between $3$ and $4\,\mathrm{keV}$, compatible with what is expected by partial mode conversion at the vacuum resonance in a magnetized atmosphere. Phase-resolved spectral and polarimetric analyses reveal that X-ray thermal radiation likely originates from a single, fairly small hot spot with a non-uniform temperature distribution. Fitting the phase-dependent $\mathrm{PA}$ measured by IXPE with a rotating vector model (RVM) constrains the source geometry and indicates that both the dipole axis and line-of-sight are misaligned with respect to the spin axis. Under these conditions, the high polarization of the source cannot be regarded as compelling evidence for the presence of vacuum birefringence in the star magnetosphere. Nevertheless, the fact that the RVM successfully reproduces the modulation of the X-ray polarization angle and the behavior of $\mathrm{PD}$ with the energy hint once more to the presence of QED effects in magnetars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15460" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining nonminimal f(T) gravity from Primordial Nucleosynthesis to Late-Universe observations</a><span class="id">[2601.15460]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a multi-epoch test of f(T) gravity with nonminimal torsion-matter coupling, combining early- and late-Universe observations. At the MeV scale, Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis constrains the fractional variation of the weak freeze-out temperature, |{\delta}{\tau}_f/{\tau}_f|, thereby mapping light-element abundances into limits on deviations from the standard expansion history. At low redshift, we confront the model with type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic-chronometer data, which respectively probe distances, the late-time standard ruler, and the Hubble rate. Independent analyses highlight the complementary roles of each dataset, while a joint SNe Ia + BAO + CC fit breaks degeneracies and yields the tightest combined bounds. As an illustration, we examine two representative torsion-modified gravity scenarios: BBN strongly limits large departures from standard cosmology, whereas late-time probes remain compatible with a near-{\Lambda}CDM background. This unified approach demonstrates the power of linking early-Universe nuclear physics with precision cosmological observables in assessing torsional extensions of gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15542" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Fluid Quantum Bouncing Cosmology I: Theoretical Model</a><span class="id">[2601.15542]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bouncing cosmologies offer an alternative to inflation by resolving the initial singularity through a contracting phase followed by a bounce into expansion. In many such models, the contracting phase is dominated by a single matter component, typically pressureless dust, which leads to an almost scale-invariant spectrum of scalar cosmological perturbations with a slight blue tilt, so that generating the observed red-tilted spectrum within this framework was challenging. In this work, we consider a more realistic scenario in which the contracting phase includes both matter and radiation, as required on physical grounds. We show that the presence of radiation can naturally induce a red tilt in the spectrum of curvature perturbations seeded by quantum vacuum fluctuations in the remote past of the contraction. Since the perturbations of the two fluids are coupled via gravity, vacuum initial conditions must be carefully defined. We demonstrate that, without fine-tuning, the resulting entropy perturbations are subdominant with respect to curvature perturbations. This suggests that a minimal two-component bounce model, involving only ordinary matter and radiation, can connect to the standard expanding cosmology with observationally viable initial conditions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A compact object with a K type star companion in the solar neighborhood: a wide post common envelope binary with a white dwarf candidate</a><span class="id">[2601.15619]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) plus a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain current prescriptions of common envelope evolution (CEE) and calibrate theoretical models of binary formation and evolution. Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($&gt;$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\,\geq\,0.58\,\rm M_{\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The initial spin matters: the impact of rapid rotation on magnetic-field amplification at merger</a><span class="id">[2601.15650]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A couple of milliseconds after the merger of a binary system of neutron stars can play a fundamental role in amplifying the comparatively low initial magnetic fields into magnetar strengths. The basic mechanism responsible for this amplification is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and we here report the first systematic study of the impact of rapid rotation on the KHI-amplification process exploiting general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations at very high-resolutions of $35\,{\rm m}$. Concentrating on four different spinning configurations, we find that aligned, anti-aligned, and mixed (aligned/anti-aligned) spin configurations lead to markedly different growth rates of the electromagnetic (EM) energy, field topologies, and vortex properties when compared to the irrotational case. These differences arise from intrinsic variations in the system dynamics, such as tidal deformation, collision strength, and contact surface area, with the anti-aligned configuration producing the largest vorticity and growth in EM energy. Importantly, while different spin configurations lead to significantly different initial growth rates of the poloidal/toroidal components, all systems converge to a specific topological partition. Our simulations are confined to a short window in time, but the different EM energies produced as a result of spin will imprint the EM emission at merger and provide information on the spinning state at merger.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15672" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The reason for the occurrence of W-type contact binaries</a><span class="id">[2601.15672]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>For more than half a century, the puzzling W-type phenomenon in contact binaries has challenged astrophysicists. In these systems, the less massive component exhibits a higher surface temperature than its more massive companion, which is a reversal of the typical A-type configuration, where the more massive star is hotter. This counterintuitive temperature inversion defies the basic stellar physics and still lacks a widely accepted explanation. In this study, we assembled a sample of over 3,000 extensively observed contact binaries and derived their complete set of physical parameters. Our statistical analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the occurrence of W-type contact binaries and the intensity and frequency of magnetic activities. This result strongly supports the hypothesis that magnetic activities are the primary driver of the W-type phenomenon and offers a compelling explanation for the observed transitions between the W-type and A-type.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15704" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for stellar contamination and water absorption in NGTS-5b's transmission spectra with GTC/OSIRIS</a><span class="id">[2601.15704]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Transmission spectroscopy serves as a valuable tool for probing atmospheric absorption features in the terminator regions of exoplanets. Stellar surface heterogeneity can introduce wavelength-dependent contamination that complicates the interpretation of planetary spectra. We aim to investigate the atmosphere of the warm sub-Saturn NGTS-5b through optical transmission spectroscopy. Two transits were observed with the low-resolution Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) on the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC). Chromatic transit light curves were modeled to derive optical transmission spectra and multiple Bayesian spectral retrievals were performed to characterize the atmospheric properties. Model comparisons provide strong evidence for contamination from unocculted stellar spots. A joint retrieval of the transmission spectra, assuming equilibrium chemistry, indicates a relatively clear atmosphere with a sub-solar C/O ratio of $&lt;$0.22 (90% upper limit) and a low metallicity of $0.10^{+0.34}_{-0.05} \times$ solar. Retrievals assuming free chemistry yield strong evidence for the presence of $\rm H_2O$, with its abundance constrained to $\log X_{\mathrm{H_2O}} = -0.79^{+0.14}_{-0.17}$. However, the abundances of other species remain unconstrained due to the limited optical wavelength coverage. The discrepancies between the two NGTS-5b transit spectra can be attributed to varying levels of stellar contamination. NGTS-5b thus appears to host a relatively clear, water-rich atmosphere, pending confirmation from additional observations of molecular bands in the infrared.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrodynamic simulations of the recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis: Nucleosynthesis predictions</a><span class="id">[2601.15713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is one of the eleven known recurrent novae in our Galaxy. It was observed in outburst in 1866 and 1946, with additional likely eruptions recorded in 1217 and 1787. Given its predicted recurrence period of approximately 80 yr, the next outburst is anticipated to occur imminently, thus motivating a thorough examination of the main characteristics of this system. We present new hydrodynamic models of the explosion of T CrB for different combinations of parameters (i.e., the mass, composition, and initial luminosity of the white dwarf, the metallicity of the accreted matter, and the mass-transfer rate). We show that mass-accretion rates between 10-8 - 10-7 Msun yr-1 are required to trigger an outburst after 80 yr of accretion of solar-composition material onto white dwarfs with masses about 1.30 - 1.38 Msun. For lower white dwarf luminosities, less massive white dwarfs, or reduced metallicity in the accreted material, higher mass-accretion rates are required to drive an explosion within this timescale. A decrease in metallicity or initial white dwarf luminosity leads to higher accumulated masses and ignition pressures, resulting in more violent outbursts. These outbursts exhibit higher peak temperatures, higher ejected masses, and greater kinetic energies. Models computed for different white dwarf masses but identical initial luminosities reveal significant differences in the elemental abundances of a wide range of species, including Ne, Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Ar, K, Ca, and Sc. These compositional differences offer a potential diagnostic tool for constraining the parameter space and discriminating between the various T CrB models reported in this study.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fuzzy dark matter soliton core hosting a supermassive black hole as a dense low-mass perturber in strong gravitational lensing</a><span class="id">[2601.15718]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent high-resolution imaging observations of strong lens systems reveal dense low-mass perturbers. We propose a soliton core, whose central density is boosted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH), in the fuzzy dark matter (FDM) model as an efficient perturber in strong gravitational lensing. The higher central density makes it less efficient in the tidal mass loss, and leads to the higher impact in gravitational lensing. We show that the mass profile of a $\sim 10^6M_\odot$ perturber in JVAS B1938+666, which does not resemble any known astronomical object, can be wel explained by a soliton core in the FDM model with the mass of $4\times 10^{-21}$eV hosting an SMBH with the mass of $4\times 10^5M_\odot$. The high mass of the SMBH may be explained by several scenarios that predcit heavy SMBH seeds such as the direct collapse black hole formation and primordial black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interaction between the ejecta, the accretion disk, and the secondary star in the recurrent nova system U Sco</a><span class="id">[2601.15725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Most efforts in the modeling of recurrent novae have centered on the initial phases of the explosion and ejection, overlooking the subsequent interaction of the ejecta, first with the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf and ultimately with the secondary star. To address this gap, a series of 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations was conducted. These simulations explored the dynamic interactions between the nova ejecta, accretion disk, and stellar companion within the framework of the recurrent nova system U Sco. Notably, the simulations incorporate rotation around the system's center of mass. The primary goal of these simulations was to qualitatively examine the impact of various model parameters, including ejecta mass, velocity, and density, as well as the mass and geometry of the accretion disk. Simulations reveal complete disruption and sweeping of the accretion disk orbiting the white dwarf star for models with flared disks and Mejecta/Mdisk larger than 1. In contrast, V-shaped disks with a (constant) high initial density and Mejecta/Mdisk &lt; 1 partially survive the impact with the nova ejecta. A very minor chemical contamination of the secondary star is anticipated in the U Sco case based on the limited impact of nova ejecta particles on the subgiant in all simulations. Minor mass ejection from the subgiant's outer layers is observed during the late-stage collision with ejecta and disk material, with some particles ejected from the binary system and some accreted by the white dwarf.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15732" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRB 250704B/EP250704a a Short Gamma-Ray Burst Powered by a Magnetar</a><span class="id">[2601.15732]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GRB 250704B/EP250704a, identified as a short gamma-ray burst (sGRB), exhibited prolonged X-ray emission following the prompt phase and, in optical and infrared (IR) bands, an unusual one-day plateau succeeded by a rapid decline. This sGRB was observed by multiple satellites and ground-based observatories across the electromagnetic spectrum. This study presents temporal and spectral analyses from radio to gamma-ray frequencies, spanning several observation periods beginning after the trigger and continuing for nearly 2 days. The results of the temporal and spectral analyses of the prompt episode, the extended X-ray component, and the afterglow phase are consistent with a millisecond magnetar undergoing accretion. The long-lasting X-ray emission is attributed to the internal energy dissipation of the magnetar spin-down power, governed by the magnetization parameter; the extended optical/IR plateau to synchrotron afterglow emission with energy injection; and the steep decay to changes in microphysical parameters during the post-jet break phase. The X-ray observations are consistent with the superposition of spin-down luminosity and synchrotron afterglow scenario. These findings suggest that the compact-object remnant is most likely a long-lived magnetar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nucleosynthesis in Type Ia Supernovae, Classical Novae, and Type I X-Ray Bursts.

For instance, the advent of high-energy astrophysics, facilitated by space-borne observatories, has ushered in a new era, offering a unique, panchromatic view of the universe (i.e., allowing multifrequency observations of stellar events); supercomputers are also playing a pivotal role, furnishing astrophysicists with computational capabilities essential for studying the intricate evolution of stars within a multidimensional framework; cosmochemists, through examination of primitive meteorites, are uncovering tiny fragments of stardust, shedding light on the physical processes operating in stars and on the mechanisms that govern condensation of stellar ejecta into solids; simultaneously, nuclear physicists managed to measure nuclear reactions at (or close to) stellar energies, using both stable and radioactive ion beam facilities.

We perform a joint redshift-binned analysis of $H_0$ across eight bins using late-Universe probes – Pantheon+ SNe Ia, DESI BAO, cosmic chronometers, and water megamasers – under three cosmological frameworks: flat $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and Padé cosmography. Under a common baseline scheme, all three models show a qualitatively similar, low-amplitude variation in the per-bin $H_0$ estimates. A simple Fourier-like parametrization captures this behaviour, but the amplitude differs from zero only at a marginal significance of about $1.71$–$1.94\,\sigma$, with similar behaviour observed across all three cosmological frameworks. We then investigate the robustness and possible origin of this feature. Alternative binning schemes preserve its qualitative form, whereas single-probe per-bin fits (SNe-only, CC-only, BAO-only) yield ratios $H_{0,i}/H_{0,\mathrm{global}}$ mostly consistent with unity and do not reproduce the pronounced drift seen in the joint baseline constraints. Finally, by comparing different global versus piecewise-constant configurations for $\{H_0,\Omega_m,M,r_d\}$, we find that a baseline-like oscillatory pattern re-emerges only when multiple degenerate parameter combinations are allowed to vary across bins, while it is strongly suppressed when only $H_0$ is bin-dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that the apparent oscillatory behaviour of $H_0(z)$ in late-time arises from known parameter degeneracies and does not constitute robust evidence for a genuine redshift evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Failed ejection and oscillations of a current-carrying filament balanced by gravity</a><span class="id">[2601.15823]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this study, we investigate the post-destabilization evolution of a filament in a gravity-balanced model. We adopt the filament model proposed by Solov'ev (2010), in which a dense filament is supported against gravity by the repulsive force between the filament current and its sub-photospheric image. We first performed an analytical investigation of this model. For the numerical study, we use a two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model that solves the MHD equations with the Lare2d numerical code. Results: In this filament model, analytical expressions are derived for the electric current density, plasma density, and their spatial distributions as functions of the model parameters. The total electric current and the filament weight are also calculated. For the numerical simulations, we constructed an equilibrium filament characterized by a magnetic field of $B_0$ = $10^{-3}$ T, mass density $\rho_0$   1.3 x $10^{-9}$ kg m$^{-3}$, and temperature T   13000 K. The system was destabilized either by increasing the currents or by reducing the filament density, and its evolution was computed. In both destabilization regimes, the filament was ejected, then halted at a certain altitude, and subsequently fell back, repeating this cycle with a period of about 600 s. The maximum filament ejection velocity was approximately 80 and 40 km $s^{-1}$, respectively. Beneath the ejected filament a current sheet forms, where magnetic reconnection occurs. The maximum ejection altitudes were determined as functions of both the destabilizing currents and the degree of filament plasma dilution. Finally, we compared results of this MHD model with those of an ideal vacuum model and discussed all results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intrinsic alignments in the FLAMINGO simulations with two-point statistics</a><span class="id">[2601.15851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intrinsic alignments are a major astrophysical contaminant for next generation large-sky surveys like Euclid and LSST. Large hydrodynamic simulations are crucial for informing the alignment modelling for these surveys. We measure position-position and position-shape correlations of a Luminous Red Galaxy sample from the FLAMINGO suite of hydrodynamical simulations, measuring the alignment signal for more than 4.9 million galaxies at redshift 0. We jointly model the clustering and alignment correlations to provide the tightest constraints on the alignment amplitude to date from a hydrodynamic simulation. We find that both the Non-Linear Alignment (NLA) and the more complex Tidal Alignment Tidal Torquing (TATT) models provide good fits to the data. We compare the measured $A_1$ amplitude to observational data and find good agreement. We measure the dependence of the NLA and TATT free parameters on halo mass. We also introduce a mass-dependent TATT model, TATT-M, by finding empirical relations between the halo mass and the TATT parameters. This allows us to fit TATT with only one parameter, $A_1$, with $A_2/A_1$ being a constant and $A_{1\delta}/A_1$ being a function of halo mass. Using a Bayesian approach, we find that TATT-M is very strongly preferred by the data over NLA. Using the baryonic feedback variations of the FLAMINGO simulation suite, we test whether the TATT parameters are sensitive to feedback. Variations in AGN and supernova feedback do not significantly change the alignment amplitude beyond the change associated with the dependence of galaxy stellar mass on the strength of feedback. Our results inform the IA modelling for upcoming surveys by providing guidance on model choices, priors and sensitivities to feedback.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Does the solar oxygen abundance change over the solar cycle? An investigation into activity-induced variations of the O I infrared triplet</a><span class="id">[2601.15919]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The determination of the solar oxygen abundance remains a central problem in astrophysics, as its accuracy is limited not only by models but also by systematics. While many of these factors have been thoroughly characterized, the effect of the solar activity cycle has so far remained unexplored. Due to its relative strength and accessibility, the O I infrared triplet is typically the primary choice for abundance studies. However, previous investigations have shown that abundances inferred from this triplet tend to be higher than expected on active stars, whereas such an overabundance effect is not observed for the much weaker forbidden O I 6300 Å line. This raises the question of whether a similar trend can be found for the Sun. To address this question, we analyze two decades' worth of synoptic disk-integrated Sun-as-a-star datasets from the FEROS, HARPS-N, PEPSI, and NEID spectrographs, focusing on the infrared triplet (7772, 7774, 7775 Å) and the forbidden O I 6300 Å line. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the PEPSI observations allows us to detect a weak but significant variation in the equivalent widths of the infrared triplet, corresponding to about 0.01 dex difference in abundance between activity minimum and maximum. This value is significantly smaller than the typical uncertainties on the solar oxygen abundance. Due to higher scatter, no comparable trend is found in the other data sets. Based on these results, we conclude that within the typical uncertainties presented in other works, we can assume the inferred solar oxygen abundance to be stable across the solar cycle, but that this effect may be significant for other, more active stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15926" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Out-of-Sample Validation of MagNet</a><span class="id">[2601.15926]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Machine learning is starting to be used in almost every industry and academic research, and solar physics is no exception.

The atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is hot with $\text{T}_{\text{eq}}&gt;2000$K and shows strong variability, for which cloud formation above a molten crust could be one possible explanation. The composition of the atmosphere of 55 Cnc e is still unknown but suggests the presence of volatiles. We have run cloud formation models on a grid of N-dominated, O-dominated, C-dominated and H-dominated atmospheres to investigate which type of cloud we could expect on hot super-Earths and hot sub-Neptunes ($1000$K $&lt;$ T $&lt;$ $3000$K). Our models combine radiative transfer with equilibrium chemistry of the gaseous and condensed phases, vertical mixing of condensable species, sedimentation, nucleation and coagulation. We find that the condensability of species is highly dependent on the oxygen abundance of an atmosphere. Oxygen poor atmospheres can be heated by UV and optical absorbers PS, TiO and CN which create temperature inversions. These inhibit condensation. Oxygen rich atmospheres are colder without temperature inversions, and are therefore more favourable environments for cloud formation. The major expected cloud component in O-dominated atmospheres with solar refractory abundance is TiO$_2$(s). Spectral features of clouds in these worlds are stronger in transmission than in emission, in particular at short wavelengths. We find a lack of optical data of solid species in comparison to the variety of stable cloud components which can form on hot, rocky planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15935" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhancing Thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Analyses with Digital Twins of the Local Universe</a><span class="id">[2601.15935]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect provides a powerful probe of the thermal pressure of ionised gas in galaxy clusters and the cosmic web; constrained simulations reconstruct the mass and velocity fields of the local Universe.

We focus on cluster predictions in the Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (BORG) paradigm, introducing CSiBORG-Manticore, a new state-of-the-art suite of digital twins – data-constrained posterior simulations whose initial conditions are inferred via Bayesian forward modelling. We develop a framework for scoring constrained simulations on their ability to match measured Compton-$y$ maps from Planck for cluster cutouts, and use it to demonstrate improvement from previous BORG reconstructions. We further validate halo masses against weak-lensing-calibrated X-ray masses from eROSITA. We also show how high-fidelity digital twins offer a practical route to extracting additional information from tSZ data through a novel calibration of the mass-observable relation, and provide a complementary framework to purely statistical analyses of Compton-$y$ maps. This paves the way for integrating the large-scale structure information inherent in constrained simulations into the study of CMB secondary anisotropies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 2 au resolution view by ALMA of the planet-hosting WISPIT 2 disk</a><span class="id">[2601.15948]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present deep, high spatial resolution interferometric observations of 0.88 mm continuum emission from the TYC 5709-354-1 system, hereafter WISPIT 2, obtained with the goal of detecting circumplanetary emission in the vicinity of the newly discovered WISPIT 2b planet. Observations with the most extended baseline configuration offered by ALMA, achieving an angular resolution of $25 \times 17$ mas ($3.3 \times 2.2$ au), revealed a single, narrow ring with a deprojected radius of 144.4 au and width of 7.2 au, and no evidence of circumplanetary emission within the cavity. Injection and recovery tests demonstrate that these observations can rule out point-like emission at the location of WISPIT 2b brighter than $\approx 45$ $\mu$Jy at the $3\sigma$ level. While these data can rule out PDS 70c like circumplanetary emission, the upper limit is consistent with empirical mass-flux relationships extrapolated from the stellar regime. Visibility modeling of the continuum ring confirms that WISPIT 2b lies significantly interior to the mm dust ring, raising doubts about the ability of WISPIT 2b to be the only driver of the dust structure. Possible solutions include either another lower mass companion, residing between WISPIT 2b and the cavity edge, likely in the gap seen by SPHERE at $\sim130$ au, or that WISPIT 2b is either substantially more massive than IR-photometry based estimates ($\sim15$ $M_{\rm Jup}$) or on a moderately eccentric orbit. The combination of observations sensitive to the gas and dust distributions on larger spatial scales and dedicated hydrodynamical modeling will help differentiate between scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaia20fnr: A binary-lens microlensing event with full orbital motion revealed by four space telescopes</a><span class="id">[2601.15969]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The microlensing event Gaia20fnr is a long-duration, non-caustic-crossing binary-lens event at high Galactic latitude. Triggered by a photometric rise detected by the Gaia space mission, the event was followed up with observations from multiple ground-based facilities and four space telescopes: Gaia, NEOWISE, Swift, and TESS. We characterize the Gaia20fnr microlensing system by determining the physical and orbital properties of the binary lens, the nature of the luminous source, and the kinematics of both the source and the lens. We employed a binary-lens microlensing model including full Keplerian orbital motion and annual microlens parallax to fit the photometric data. The event is best explained by a K2 giant source at $D_{\rm S} = 3.10 \pm 0.10\,\mathrm{kpc}$ lensed by a stellar binary composed of $M_{\rm L,1} = 0.46 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm L,2} = 0.52 \pm 0.06\,M_\odot$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L} = 0.54 \pm 0.05\,\mathrm{kpc}$. The light curve exhibits strong signatures of orbital motion and requires a full Keplerian model with a period of $P = 0.67 \pm 0.04\,\mathrm{yr}$ and a radial-velocity semi-amplitude of $K_1 = 16.9 \pm 0.9\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Gaia20fnr is one of the few microlensing events for which a complete Keplerian binary-lens solution has been derived. The model can be tested with follow-up radial-velocity and high-resolution imaging observations as well as forthcoming Gaia DR4 and DR5 astrometric time-series data. Its long duration, multi-peak structure, and extensive coverage make it a benchmark for studying faint nearby low-mass binaries through microlensing.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15994" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SVOM discovery of a strong X-ray outburst of the blazar 1ES 1959+650 and multi-wavelength follow-up with the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory</a><span class="id">[2601.15994]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>On December 6, 2024, 1ES 1959+650, one of the X-ray brightest blazars known, underwent a high-amplitude X-ray outburst detected by SVOM, the first such discovery with this mission. The source was subsequently monitored with SVOM and Swift from December 2024 to March 2025. We report the detection and multi-wavelength follow-up of this event, and describe the temporal and spectral evolution observed during the campaign. Data from SVOM/MXT, SVOM/ECLAIRs, and Swift/XRT were analyzed with log-parabola models to track flux and spectral variability. The source was detected in a bright state over the 0.3-50 keV range. During the three months of monitoring, the X-ray flux varied significantly, showing episodes of spectral hardening at high flux levels. The spectral curvature evolved more irregularly and did not show a clear trend with flux. A shift of the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) synchrotron peak to higher energies is seen when the flux increases. This constitutes the first blazar outburst discovered in X-rays by SVOM. The coordinated follow-up with Swift provided continuous coverage of the flare and highlights the strong complementarity of the two missions for time-domain studies of blazars. The flare shows no clear signatures of either Fermi I or Fermi II acceleration, suggesting a mixed Fermi I/II scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modeling the Impact of Unresolved Stellar Companions on Detection Sensitivity in Kepler's Small Planet Occurrence Rates</a><span class="id">[2601.16031]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Unresolved stellar companions can cause both under-estimations in the radii of transiting planets and over-estimations of their detectability, affecting our ability to reliably measure planet occurrence rates. To quantify the latter, we identified a control sample of 198 Kepler stars with sensitivity to Earth-like planets if they were single stars, and imaged them with adaptive optics. In 20% of systems, we detected stellar companions that were close enough to go unresolved in Kepler observations. We calculated the distribution of planet radius correction factors needed to adjust for these observed companions, along with simulations of undetected companions to which our observations were not sensitive. We then used these correction factors to optimize an occurrence rate model for small close-in planets while correcting Kepler's detection efficiency for the presence of unresolved companions, and quantified how this correction affects occurrence estimates. Median occurrence rates for small planets between $2-100$ days increased by an average factor of $1.08-1.19$ (depending on statistical treatments), with the largest differences found for smaller planets at larger orbital periods. We found that the frequency of Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone ($\eta_\oplus$) increased by a factor of ${1.18}_{-0.66}^{+0.43}-{1.46}_{-0.83}^{+0.53}$ when accounting for the effect of unresolved companions on Kepler's detection sensitivity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16048" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling the Spectral Morphological Division of Fast Radio Bursts with CHIME/FRB Catalog 2</a><span class="id">[2601.16048]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are commonly divided into repeating and apparently non-repeating sources, but whether these represent distinct physical populations remains uncertain.

We find that FRBs remain primarily separated into two clusters in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with a recall of 0.94 for known repeaters, indicating strong robustness. Consistent with Catalog 1 analyses, we confirm that the spectral morphology parameter, specifically spectral running remains the key discriminator between the two populations, indicating that narrowband emission is an intrinsic and persistent property of repeating FRBs. With the enlarged Catalog 2 sample, we further identify a stable subclass of atypical repeaters (about $6\%$ of repeating bursts) that are broadband, shorter in duration, and more luminous, resembling non-repeating bursts. The Nonrepeater-like cluster also shows higher inferred energies and dispersion measures, consistent with a scenario in which apparently non-repeating FRBs may result from observational incompleteness, with low-energy repeating bursts remaining undetected. Our results provide new statistical evidence for a physical connection between repeating and non-repeating FRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16159" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Magnetar fraction in Core-Collapse Supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.16159]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetars are extreme neutron stars powered by ultra-strong magnetic fields ($\sim10^{14}$ Gauss) and are compelling engines for some of the most powerful extragalactic transients such as Super Luminous Supernovae, Gamma-Ray Bursts, and Fast Radio Bursts. Yet their formation rate relative to ordinary neutron stars remains uncertain, often precluding direct comparisons with the rates of these extragalactic transients. Furthermore, magnetars have been recently shown to be evolutionarily related to other neutron star classes, complicating the estimate of the exact magnetar fraction within the neutron star population. We study the magnetar birth fraction in core-collapse supernovae using pulsar population synthesis of all isolated neutron star classes in our Galaxy, incorporating self-consistently the Galactic dynamical evolution, spin-down and magneto-thermal evolution. This approach allows us to derive strong constraints from small close-to-complete observational samples. In particular, looking at the age-limited young ($&lt;$2 kyr) neutron star population in the Milky Way we find 24 detected young neutron stars, with only 10 of them (41%) being classical rotational powered pulsars, while the others (59%) are either magnetars or central compact objects, the latter believed to be equally magnetically powered. We further compare the results with the nearby volume-limited class ($&lt;$500 pc) of X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron stars, old nearby magnetars. We conclude that the observed population of isolated neutron stars in the Galaxy can be reproduced only by assuming a core-collapse supernova rate larger than two, and a larger magnetar fraction than previously inferred. By assuming a bimodal initial magnetic field ($B_0$) distribution at birth, we find that the magnetar class peaks between $B_0\sim 1-2.5\times10^{14}$ Gauss and represents on average $\sim50$% of the entire neutron star population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16165" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 4.

By incorporating additional datasets (photometric galaxies and CMB lensing cross-correlations) and extending the bispectrum likelihood to smaller scales using a consistent one-loop theory computation, we achieve substantial gains in constraining power relative to previous analyses. Combining with the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data and using cosmic microwave background (CMB) priors on the power spectrum tilt and baryon density, we obtain tight constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model, finding the Hubble constant $H_0=69.08\pm 0.37~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, the matter density fraction $\Omega_m=0.2973\pm 0.0050$, and the mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8 = 0.815\pm 0.016$ (or the lensing parameter $S_8\equiv\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}=0.811\pm 0.016$), corresponding to $0.6\%$, $1.7\%$, and $2\%$ precision respectively. Adding the Pantheon+ supernova sample (SNe), we find a preference of $2.6\sigma$ for the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model from low-redshift data alone, which increases to $2.8\sigma$ when exchanging the SNe with Planck CMB data. Combining full-shape data with BAO, CMB, and SNe likelihoods, we improve the dark energy figure-of-merit by $18\%$ and bound the sum of the neutrino masses to $M_\nu&lt;0.057$ eV in $\Lambda$CDM and $M_\nu&lt;0.095$ eV in the $w_0w_a$ dynamical dark energy model (both at 95\% CL). This represents an improvement of $25\%$ over the background expansion constraints and the strongest bound on neutrino masses in $w_0w_a$CDM to date.

We present a multiwavelength analysis of the SAS and the subsequent &quot;faint state&quot; using observations from HST, Swift, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton. Our results indicate that the SAS was driven by an increase in the mass accretion rate, which caused the accretion disk's boundary layer to become optically thick. A weighted least squares regression analysis quantifies the evolution of the accretion components, displaying a highly significant (4.5$\sigma$) increase in the luminosity of the optically thin cooling flow (L$_{cf}$) and a marginal (2.58$\sigma$) decrease in the optically thick boundary layer luminosity (L$_{bb}$) as the system transitioned into the faint state. We find that this dimming is consistent with an intrinsic change in the accretion flow rather than dust obscuration, supported by the lack of infrared excess and the stability of the 2175 Å feature. Additionally, a time-series analysis using autoregressive modeling to account for correlated red noise revealed no significant periodicities, thereby disputing the previously reported $\sim$6000 s signal. These findings suggest that the pre-outburst evolution of T CrB is characterized by significant changes in the accretion disk structure and boundary layer, providing a self-consistent physical framework for the system's behavior as it approaches eruption.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining dark energy models using Jackknife and Bootstrap resampling</a><span class="id">[2601.16197]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Analyses of type Ia supernovae have helped us shed light on the existence and nature of dark energy.

Azimuthal variation is observed in the spectral index distribution of both disks. In AS 205 N, the spectral index minimum in the southwest is coincident with the peaks of CO($2-1$), CO($3-2$), and $^{13}$CO($3-2$) integrated intensity and the relative position of its southern counterpart.

Solar activity, dominated by the 11-year cyclic evolution, has been observed directly since 1610. Before that, indirect cosmogenic proxy data are used to reconstruct it over millennia. Recently, the precision of radiocarbon measurements has improved sufficiently to allow reconstructing solar activity over millennia. Aims. The first detailed reconstruction of solar activity, represented by annual sunspot numbers, is presented for 1-969 CE. Methods. The reconstruction of sunspot numbers from D14C was performed using a physics-based method involving several steps: using a carbon-cycle box model, the 14C production rate, corrected for the geomagnetic shielding, was computed from the measured data; The open solar magnetic flux was computed using a model of the heliospheric cosmic-ray modulation; Sunspot numbers were calculated using a model of the evolution of the Sun's magnetic field. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was used to account for different sources of uncertainty. Results. Annual sunspot numbers were reconstructed for the first millennium CE. This period includes one extreme solar event of 774 CE and one Grand solar minimum of 650-730 CE. We could identify 91 solar cycles, of which 26 were well-defined, while 24 and 41 were reasonably and poorly defined, respectively. The mean cycle length was 10.6 years, but the lengths of individual cycles vary between 8 and 15 years. The existence of empirical Waldmeier's relations remains inconclusive. No significant periodicities were found beyond the 11-year cycle. Conclusions. This work fills the gap in the solar cycle statistics between the previously reconstructed first millennium BCE and the second millennium CE, providing vital constraints for the solar dynamo and irradiance models. A consistent 3-millennium-long reconstruction of sunspot numbers, based on a composite multi-proxy cosmogenic record, is pending.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14366" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Waves and Primordial Black Holes produced by Dark Meta Stable Vacuum Decay</a><span class="id">[2601.14366]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inspired by string theory and cosmological constant problem, it is plausible that the Universe's vacuum structure is characterized by a landscape of metastable vacua. The existence of dark matter and dark energy further suggests that the dark sector may inhabit its own &quot;dark landscape&quot;. If the dark vacuum is metastable, bubbles of lower-energy phases can nucleate at an approximately constant rate. Because the Hubble expansion rate is monotonically non-increasing with cosmic time, such nucleation can eventually lead to percolation and completion of a dark-sector phase transition. In this work, we investigate the phenomenological consequences of this transition, focusing on the resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background and the potential formation of primordial black holes. We find that the gravitational wave spectrum peaks at $k_{\mathrm{peak}}=3.1 H_{\mathrm{PT}}$, with an amplitude $\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}^{\mathrm{peak}}\simeq1.5 \Omega_\gamma(\Delta\rho/\rho_{\mathrm{tot}})^2$.

Recently, a new class of exact nonlinear inhomogeneous solutions was discovered: single-wave (SW) solutions of the fast flavor system. The key property is that the flavor occupation numbers remain homogeneous, whereas the field of flavor coherence varies spatially with a single wave vector. The equations of motion for this structure resemble those of a collection of classical spins, in analogy with the homogeneous slow and fast flavor cases. In contrast, the SW system is not integrable (it does not possess Gaudin invariants) so that, while two-beam pendulum solutions are inevitable, they do not extend to a multi-angle system. We develop a taxonomy of all known nonlinear collective flavor solutions, explaining the overlap between categories and their differences.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15415" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compact Stars Sourced by Dark Matter Halos and Their Frozen States</a><span class="id">[2601.15415]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inspired by regular black holes (RBHs) sourced by dark matter halos, we generalize the anisotropic energy-momentum tensor by relaxing the $P_r = -\rho$ condition between radial pressure and density.

We derive a directionality factor arising from the relative bulk motion between the neutrino medium and plasma, and show that it can produce an anomalous frequency dependence of the polarization-rotation angle, distinct from the $\omega^{-2}$ scaling of Faraday rotation. This anomalous scaling can occur either at the resonance plasma frequency condition $\omega \simeq \omega_p$, or when $E_\nu^{0}\simeq m_\nu \omega/\omega_p$ lies within the range of the neutrino energy spectrum. We estimate the effect for three scenarios: jets propagating through the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B), jets with an internal flux of high-energy neutrinos, and accretion-disk plasma permeated by the C$\nu$B. Of the three scenarios, the latter gives the largest rotation angle $\phi_{\rm d} \sim 10^{-35}\,\mathrm{rad}$, at X-ray frequencies. Although the predicted rotation angles are below current polarimetric sensitivity, the identified spectral signatures provide a theoretical framework for probing neutrino asymmetries and AGN plasma properties independent of magnetic field models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15985" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photon-dark photon oscillation in M87 and Crab Nebula environments</a><span class="id">[2601.15985]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact astrophysical systems such as neutron stars and black holes provide powerful laboratories for testing feebly coupled dark photons (DPs).

We show that realistic non-monotonic plasma density profiles generically enhance resonant conversion relative to monotonic models, leading to substantially stronger constraints on the photon-DP kinetic mixing parameter ($\epsilon$). Using spectral data from the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87*, extending to the LOFAR band, we derive a bound $\epsilon \simeq 7\times10^{-6}$ at the DP mass $m_{A'} \simeq 5\times10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation distance $3r_{\rm ph}$, where $r_{\rm ph}$ denotes the photon sphere radius. From the Crab pulsar-wind Nebula, we obtain an even stronger constraint, $\epsilon \simeq 8\times10^{-7}$ at $m_{A'} \simeq 4\times10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$ for oscillation baselines of order $10^{3}\,\mathrm{km}$, surpassing existing astrophysical limits in realistic plasma backgrounds. While laboratory and cosmological bounds remain slightly stronger at comparable masses, observation of compact objects with larger surface magnetic fields and measurements of photon spectra at lower frequencies would enhance the limits on the photon-DP coupling by orders of magnitude.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Different effects of the Lorentz and Gaussian bump functions on the formation of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2403.15979]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scalar perturbations in the inflation can be amplified when the base inflation potential $V_b(\phi)$ incorporates a local bump $f(\phi)$ such as $V(\phi)=V_b(\phi)(1+f(\phi))$. This modification will lead to a peak in the curvature power spectrum, increasing a significant abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs). However, since there is no underlying physical reason for the choice of $f(\phi)$, it is essential to investigate the effects of various bump functions on PBH generation. In this paper, we choose the well-known Starobinsky potential as the base inflation potential to compare the effects produced by different bumps, specifically focusing on the Lorentz and Gaussian bumps which are widely used. To clearly illustrate the differences between these two bumps, we keep parameters in bump functions the same. We find an interesting and novel result that the Lorentz cases manifest a stronger ability to enhance the power spectrum and produce more abundance of PBHs than Gaussian cases. Moreover, we also investigate the different effects of bump functions on the scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs). The results indicate that the Lorentz bump generates SIGWs with a higher energy density, which can be potentially detected in the future. Our study gives valuable insights into the choice and constraints on the bump functions, and the different effects may distinguish the two bump cases for practical purposes in future experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for GeV emission of the superluminous supernova SN 2017egm</a><span class="id">[2407.05968]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a new class of transients with luminosities $\sim10 -100$ times larger than the usual core-collapse supernovae (SNe).

The GeV-TeV emission of SLSNe has been predicted in the literature but has not been convincingly detected yet. Here we report the results of the search for $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of SN 2017egm, one of the closest SLSNe detected so far, using 15 years of {\it Fermi}-LAT Pass 8 data. There is a transient $\gamma$-ray source appearing about 2 months after this event and lasting a few months. Monte Carlo simulations show that the $\gamma$-ray signal has a global significance of {\it at least} 4$\sigma$. Both the peak time and the luminosity of the GeV emission are consistent with the magnetar model prediction, suggesting that such a GeV transient is the high-energy counterpart of SN 2017egm and the central engine of this SLSNe is a young magnetar.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05326" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Running the small-correlated-against-large estimator at scale: Applications of small-scale CMB lensing estimators on realistic simulations</a><span class="id">[2409.05326]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Small-Correlated-Against-Large Estimator (SCALE) for small-scale lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) provides a novel method for measuring the amplitude of CMB lensing power without the need for reconstruction of the lensing field. In our previous study, we showed that the SCALE method can outperform existing reconstruction methods to detect the presence of lensing at small scales ($\ell \gg 3000$). Here we develop a procedure to include information from SCALE in cosmological parameter inference. We construct a precise neural network emulator to quickly map cosmological parameters to desired CMB observables such as temperature and lensing power spectra and SCALE cross spectra. We also outline a method to apply SCALE to full-sky maps of the CMB temperature field, and construct a likelihood for the application of SCALE in parameter estimation. SCALE supplements conventional observables such as the CMB power spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations in constraining parameters that are sensitive to the small-scale lensing amplitude such as the neutrino mass $m_\nu$. We show that including estimates of the small-scale lensing amplitude from SCALE in such an analysis provides enough constraining information to measure the minimum neutrino mass at $4\sigma$ significance in the scenario of minimal mass, and higher significance for higher mass. Finally, we show that SCALE will play a powerful role in constraining models of clustering that generate scale-dependent modulation to the distribution of matter and the lensing power spectrum, as predicted by models of warm or fuzzy dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13399" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic acceleration and the Hubble tension from baryon acoustic oscillation data</a><span class="id">[2409.13399]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the null tests of cosmic accelerated expansion by using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data measured by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and reconstruct the dimensionless Hubble parameter $E(z)$ from the DESI BAO Alcock-Paczynski (AP) data using Gaussian process to perform the null test. We find strong evidence of accelerated expansion from the DESI BAO AP data. By reconstructing the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ from the DESI BAO AP data, we find that accelerated expansion persisted until $z \lesssim 0.7$ with a 99.7\% confidence level. Additionally, to provide insights into the Hubble tension problem, we propose combining the reconstructed $E(z)$ with $D_H/r_d$ data to derive the model-independent result $r_d h=99.8\pm 3.1$ Mpc. This result is consistent with measurements from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies using the $\Lambda$CDM model. We also propose a model-independent method for reconstructing the comoving angular diameter distance $D_M(z)$ from the distance modulus $\mu$ using SNe Ia data and combining this result with DESI BAO data of $D_M/r_d$ to constrain the value of $r_d$. We find that the value of $r_d$ derived from this model-independent method is smaller than that obtained from CMB measurements, with a significant discrepancy of at least 4.17$\sigma$.

WINTER is a near-infrared time-domain survey designed for electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational-wave sources localized to $\leq$300 deg$^{2}$. The instrument's wide field of view (1.2 deg$^2$), dedicated 1-m robotic telescope, and near-infrared coverage (0.9-1.7 microns) are optimized for searching for kilonovae, which are expected to exhibit a relatively long-lived near-infrared component. S250206dm is the only neutron star merger in the fourth observing run (to date) localized to $\leq$300 deg$^{2}$ with a False Alarm Rate below one per year. It has a $55\%$ probability of being a neutron star-black hole (NSBH) merger and a $37\%$ probability of being a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, with a $50\%$ credible region spanning 38 deg$^2$, an estimated distance of 373 Mpc, and an overall false alarm rate of approximately one in 25 years. WINTER covered $43\%$ of the probability area at least once and $35\%$ at least three times. Through automated and human candidate vetting, all transient candidates found in WINTER coverage were rejected as kilonova candidates. Unsurprisingly, given the large estimated distance of 373 Mpc, the WINTER upper limits do not constrain kilonova models. This study highlights the promise of systematic infrared searches and the need for future wider and deeper infrared surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distinguishing the Origin of Eccentric Black Hole Mergers with Gravitational-wave Spin Measurements</a><span class="id">[2505.13589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It remains an open question whether the binary black hole mergers observed with gravitational-wave detectors originate from the evolution of isolated massive binary stars or were dynamically driven by perturbations from the environment. Recent evidence for non-zero orbital eccentricity in a handful of events is seen as support for a non-negligible fraction of the population experiencing external driving of the merger. However, it is unclear from which formation channel eccentric binary black-hole mergers would originate: dense star clusters, hierarchical field triples, active galactic nuclei, or wide binaries in the Galaxy could all be culprits. Here, we investigate whether the spin properties of eccentric mergers could be used to break this degeneracy. Using the fact that different formation channels are predicted to either produce eccentric mergers with mutually aligned or randomly oriented black-hole spins, we investigate how many confident detections would be needed in order for the two models to be statistically distinguishable. If a few percent of binary black hole mergers retain measurable eccentricity in the bandwidth of ground-based detectors, we report a $\sim9\,\%$ chance that we could confidently distinguish both models (Bayes factor $\ln\mathcal{B}&gt;3$) after the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, $\sim63\,\%$ for LIGO A#, and $\sim98\,\%$ for the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01371" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-bound hybrid stars with strong phase transitions can relieve major compact star observation tensions</a><span class="id">[2507.01371]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii in the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event.

With a peak bolometric luminosity of  $\mathrm{10^{45.6}\,erg\,s^{-1}}$, it is one of the most luminous thermal transients ever discovered. Extensive spectroscopic follow-up post-peak showed only a featureless continuum throughout its evolution. This, combined with its nuclear location, blue colour at peak and lack of prior evidence of an AGN in its host lead us to interpret this event as a `featureless' tidal disruption event (TDE). It displays photometric evolution atypical of most TDEs, cooling from  30 kK to  10 kK in the first  300 days post-peak, with potential implications for future photometric selection of candidate TDEs. No X-ray or radio emission is detected, placing constraints on the presence of on-axis jetted emission or a visible inner-accretion disk. Modelling the optical light curve with existing theoretical prescriptions, we find that AT2019cmw may be the result of the disruption of a star in the tens of solar masses by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Combined with a lack of detectable star formation in its host galaxy, it could imply the existence of a localised region of star formation around the SMBH.

The properties of these outflows change dramatically between different spectral/accretion states. Compact jets are observed during the hard state and are quenched during the soft state, while discrete ejecta are mainly launched during the hard-to-soft state transition. Currently, we do not understand what triggers the formation/destruction of compact jets or the launch of discrete ejecta. In this context, finding a unique link between the jet evolution and the properties of the X-ray emission, such as its fast variability, would imply major progress in our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms that drive relativistic outflows in BH XRBs. Here we show that a brief, strong radio re-brightening during a predominantly soft state of the BH XRB MAXI J1348$-$630 was contemporaneous with a significant increase in the X-ray rms variability observed with NICER in 2019. During this phase, the variability displayed significant changes and, at the same time, MAXI J1348$-$630 launched two relativistic discrete ejecta that we detected with the MeerKAT and ATCA radio-interferometers. We propose that short-lived compact jets were reactivated during this excursion to the hard-intermediate state and were switched off before the ejecta launch, a behavior that has been very rarely observed in these systems. Interestingly, with the caveat of gaps in our radio and X-ray coverage, we suggest a tentative correspondence between the launch of ejecta and the drop in X-ray rms variability in this source, while other typical X-ray signatures associated with discrete ejections are not detected. We discuss how these results provide us with insights into the complex dynamic coupling between the jets and hot corona in BH XRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11993" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">STRAWBERRY: Finding haloes in the gravitational potential</a><span class="id">[2509.11993]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here, we present a novel algorithm that discriminates between bound and unbound particles by consideration of the gravitational potential from an accelerated reference frame – also referred to as `the boosted potential'.

This approach has core benefits over previous approaches, since it does not require any ad-hoc thresholds (such as over-density criteria), it includes the gravitational effect of all particles in the binding criterion (improving over widely used self-potential binding checks) and it only operates with instantaneous information (making it simpler than approaches based on dynamical histories). We show that particles typically become bound between their first peri- and apo-centeric passage and that bound and unbound populations show very distinct characteristics through their distribution in phase space, their density profiles, their virial ratios, and their redshift evolution.

While dark matter annihilation has long been considered a leading explanation, an alternative scenario involving a large population of millisecond pulsars remains viable. Testing this hypothesis with electromagnetic observations is difficult, as pulsar searches in the bulge are strongly affected by interstellar scattering, high sky temperature, and source confusion. We investigate whether gravitational-wave observations with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) could provide an independent probe of the millisecond pulsar binary population in the Galactic bulge in the future. We constructed synthetic populations of detached millisecond pulsar-white dwarf binaries under two illustrative formation scenarios: an accreted scenario, in which systems are deposited by disrupted globular clusters, and an in situ scenario, in which binaries form through isolated binary evolution. In both cases, only $10^{-5}$-$10^{-4}$ of the underlying bulge population is detectable by LISA. Still, even a few detections would imply tens to hundreds of thousands of unseen systems. Accreted binaries are expected to have lower chirp masses ($\sim$0.4 M$_\odot$), while in situ binaries produce more massive companions ($\sim$0.9 M$_\odot$), though part of this contrast reflects our modelling assumptions. LISA will measure binary frequencies with high precision, but chirp masses can only be determined for the most massive or highest-frequency systems. Thus, identifying millisecond-pulsar binaries among the far more numerous double white dwarfs will be challenging, as their gravitational-wave signals alone are indistinguishable. However, coordinated follow-up with the Square Kilometre Array of LISA-selected targets could directly test the millisecond-pulsar explanation of the $\gamma$-ray excess.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The effect of matter discreteness on gravitational wave propagation in post-geometrical optics</a><span class="id">[2509.13884]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gravitational wave equation of motion includes direct coupling to the Riemann tensor.

Photons traversing magnetized regions can convert into ALPs, producing characteristic, energy-dependent absorption features in astrophysical spectra. The probability of such conversions depends sensitively on both the photon energy and the properties of the intervening magnetic fields. Most existing searches have focused on individual astrophysical sources, but uncertainties in the structure and strength of cosmic magnetic fields have limited their reach. Recently, we have demonstrated that active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through galaxy clusters provide especially promising targets for ALP searches. By stacking multiple AGN-cluster sightlines, one can average over poorly known magnetic field configurations in galaxy clusters and recover a distinctive ALP-induced spectral suppression, thereby significantly enhancing sensitivity. In this work, we investigate a possible systematic uncertainty in such analyses: the intrinsic time-variability of AGN spectra. We demonstrate that AGN flux variability is correlated with spectral hardness, and that time-averaging over flaring and quiescent states can potentially mimic the suppression features imprinted by ALP-photon mixing. Our findings imply that the recent constraints remain conservative, and that incorporating detailed spectral variability into stacking analyses can further sharpen the search for axion-like particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09261" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light Travel Time Effects in Kilonova Models</a><span class="id">[2510.09261]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The extremely rapid evolution of kilonovae results in spectra that change on an hourly basis. These spectra are key to understanding the processes occurring within the event, but this rapid evolution is an unfamiliar domain compared to other explosive transient events, such as supernovae. In particular, the most obvious P Cygni feature in the spectra of AT2017gfo – commonly attributed to strontium – possesses an emission component that emerges after, and ultimately outlives, its associated absorption dip. This delay is theorised to arise from reverberation effects, wherein photons emitted earlier in the kilonova's evolution are scattered before reaching the observer, causing them to be detected at later times. We aim to examine how the finite speed of light – and therefore the light travel time to an observer – contributes to the shape and evolution of spectral features in kilonovae. Using a simple model, and tracking the length of the journey photons undertake to an observer, we are able to test the necessity of accounting for this time delay effect when modelling kilonovae. In periods where the photospheric temperature is rapidly evolving, we show spectra synthesised using a time independent approach are visually distinct from those where these time delay effects are accounted for. Therefore, in rapidly evolving events such as kilonovae, time dependence must be taken into account.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09430" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The choice of Planck CMB likelihood in cosmological analyses</a><span class="id">[2510.09430]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compare cosmological parameters from different Planck sky maps and likelihood pipelines, assessing robustness of cosmological results with respect to the choice of the latest Planck maps-likelihood combination. We show that, for the Planck multipole range retained in combination with ground-based observations, different products give very similar cosmological solutions; small remaining differences are reduced by the addition of other CMB datasets to Planck. In particular, constraints on extended cosmological models benefit from the addition of small-scale power from ground-based experiments and are completely insensitive to the choice of Planck maps and likelihood. For this work we derive and release a nuisance-marginalized dataset and CamSpec-NPIPE-lite likelihood for the Planck NPIPE data injected into the CamSpec likelihood - which are usually used to obtain the reference Planck PR4 cosmology. Using the extracted CMB spectra we show that the additional constraining power for cosmology is coming from polarization at all scales and from temperature at multipoles above 1500 when going from PR3 to PR4. We also show that full marginalization over the CamSpec foreground nuisance parameters can impact parameter inference and model selections when truncating some scales; our new likelihood enables correct combinations with other CMB datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma-ray Orbital Modulation in Spider Pulsars: Three Discoveries and a Universal Modulated Fraction</a><span class="id">[2510.11699]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Compact binary millisecond pulsars (also known as spiders) allow us to probe pulsar winds in their innermost regions, between the light cylinder (radius $\sim10^{7}$ cm) and the companion star (at $\sim10^{11}$ cm). Their flux is known to vary along the orbit, from radio to X-rays. During the past decade, gamma-ray orbital modulation (GOM) has been discovered in a handful of spiders, but its origin remains largely unknown. We present the results of a systematic search for GOM among 43 systems, selecting pulsed 0.1-1 GeV photons and using spin and orbital ephemeris from Fermi's Third Pulsar Catalog. We discover GOM from three spiders - PSR J1124-3653, PSR J1946-5403 and PSR J2215+5135 - and confirm four previous detections. In all seven cases so far, the GOM peaks near the pulsar's superior conjunction. The X-ray orbital light curves are usually in antiphase, peaking when the pulsar is at inferior conjunction, but we find one case where both gamma-rays and X-rays peak around superior conjunction: PSR J1946-5403. We measure the modulated fractions of the GOM and find consistent values for all seven spiders, with an average $22.0\pm2.6\%$. Including eclipsing systems seen edge-on, we find no clear dependence of the modulated fraction on the orbital inclination (within $\simeq$45-90$^\circ$). Our results challenge previous models proposed to explain GOM in spiders, based on inverse Compton and synchrotron emission close to the companion, since these predict a clear dependence on orbital inclination (stronger modulation at high inclinations). We nearly double the number of GOM detections in spiders, showing that it is more common than previously thought.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the Short Dissipation Scales and Current-Sheet Properties of Low-Coronal EUV Brightenings</a><span class="id">[2510.22822]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Solar Orbiter EUV observations reveal ubiquitous small-scale brightenings in the quiet-Sun low corona.

The brightenings are observed at heights of 1-5 Mm and span energies of 10^20 - 10^24 erg, well below the classical nanoflare regime, with the lowest-energy brightenings preferentially originating in the lowest coronal layers. Two distinct dissipation regimes are identified: impulsive brightenings with timescales of 1-10 s, consistent with fast, Alfvenic magnetic reconnection in low-beta plasma, and longer-lived heating episodes lasting 10-100 s, indicative of slower, resistive current-sheet dissipation under higher-beta conditions. The observed dissipation scales suggest a transition from kinetic-scale reconnection to macroscopic current-sheet heating in the low corona. These results support a multi-scale energy-release framework and highlight the role of low-altitude, small-scale current-sheet dissipation in quiet-Sun coronal heating.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NEOForCE: Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events</a><span class="id">[2510.25923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Robust impact monitoring of near-Earth objects is an essential task of planetary defense. Current systems such as NASA's Sentry-II, the University of Pisa's CLOMON2, and ESA's Aegis have been highly successful, but independent approaches are essential to ensure reliability and to cross-validate predictions of possible impacts. We present NEOForCE (Near-Earth Objects' Forecast of Collisional Events), a new independent monitoring system for asteroid impact prediction. By relying on orbital solutions from DynAstVO at Paris Observatory and using an original methodology for uncertainty propagation, NEOForCE provides an alternative line of verification for impact assessments and strengthens the overall robustness of planetary defense. As other monitoring systems, NEOForCE samples several thousand virtual asteroids from the uncertainty region and integrates their orbits up to 100 years into the future. Instead of searching for close approaches of the virtual asteroids with the Earth, our system looks for times when the Earth comes close to the realistic uncertainty regions around them, which are mostly stretched along their osculating orbits. We also estimate the maximal impact probability, and only if this value is large enough do we continue to the next step. In this second step, we compute how the original asteroid orbit should be modified so that the new trajectory leads to an Earth impact, which allows us to confirm the possible collision and estimate the impact probability. We tested NEOForCE against NASA's Sentry-II system on five representative asteroids: 2000 SG344, 2005 QK76, 2008 JL3, 2023 DO and 2008 EX5. NEOForCE successfully recovered mostly all possible collisions reported by Sentry-II with impact probabilities above e-7, demonstrating the robustness of our approach. In addition, NEOForCE identified several potential impacts at the e-7 - e-6 level that Sentry-II did not report.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Diagnosing Interstellar Magnetic Turbulence with TeV Pulsar Halos</a><span class="id">[2512.07290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar magnetic field is essential in various astrophysical phenomena and processes. Pulsar halos are a recently discovered class of TeV gamma-ray sources formed by escaping electrons/positrons from pulsars. The morphology of the halo is regulated by the diffusion of those escaping particles, and hence carries information of the interstellar magnetic field. We suggest that the morphology of TeV pulsar halos can be used as a novel probe of the properties of interstellar magnetic field around the pulsar, such as the Alfvénic Mach number and the mean direction. We establish a theoretical relation between these quantities and the observational features of the halo's morphology based on the anisotropic diffusion model, and show how X-ray observations of the pulsar halos can further improve the diagnosis of the magnetic field.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05512" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hidden pattern of self-invariant cosmic expansion: Empirical evidence from Hubble diagram of supernovae</a><span class="id">[2601.05512]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present empirical evidence extracted directly from the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa demonstrating that the speed of light varies as the universe expands. Moreover, the speed of light must vary in a specific quantifiable manner. To show this, we reformulate the kinematics of late-time acceleration using Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=(t/t_0)^\mu$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_0a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying c along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The new model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of SNeIa and exhibits a strong degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates a self-invariant cosmic evolution: at all instants during the late-time epoch, the speed of light is exactly proportional to the rate of cosmic expansion, viz. $c=\mu^{-1}c_0t_0\,da/dt$, a characteristic that is absent in the $\Lambda$CDM model. This synchronous behavior between $c$ and $da/dt$ carries profound cosmological implications that we will discuss, regarding (i) the nature of late-time acceleration; (ii) a resolution to the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalized cosmological principle into the time domain; and (v) a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology. This newfound kinematic $c\propto da/dt$ relation represents a stringent requirement that any viable dynamical model of cosmology must satisfy, a requirement that the $\Lambda$CDM model does not fulfill. Thus, our paper delivers the clearest and most decisive evidence to date that challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of cosmology and calls for variable-$c$ modifications to General Relativity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling Hidden Clustering: An Unsupervised Machine Learning Study of Repeating FRB 20220912A</a><span class="id">[2601.14065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio transients of extragalactic origin. Classifying repeating FRBs is essential for understanding their emission mechanisms, but remains challenging due to their short durations, high variability, and increasing data volume. Traditional methods often rely on subjective criteria and struggle with high-dimensional data. In this study, we apply an unsupervised machine learning framework that combines Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) to eight observed parameters from FRB 20220912A. Our analysis reveals three distinct clusters of bursts with varying spectral and fluence properties. Comparisons with clustering studies on other repeaters show that some of our clusters share similar features with sources such as FRB 20201124A and FRB 121102, suggesting possible common emission mechanisms. We also provide qualitative interpretations for each cluster, highlighting the spectral diversity within a single source. Notably, one cluster shows broadband emission and high fluence, which are typically seen in non-repeating FRBs. This raises the possibility that some non-repeaters may be misclassified repeaters due to observational limitations. Our results demonstrate the utility of machine learning in uncovering intrinsic diversity in FRB emission and provide a foundation for future classification studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Not-So-Compact Companion: Massive, Oversize White Dwarf in a Post-Common Envelope Eclipsing Binary</a><span class="id">[2601.14378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We provide a detailed characterization of 2M07515777+1807352, a post-common envelope eclipsing binary system with a 10.3 d, nearly, but not quite, circular orbit (e = 0.02). This system consists of a massive white dwarf (WD) ($1.08$ M$_{\odot}$) and a 4400 K main-sequence companion (0.66 M$_{\odot}$). This WD is among the most massive known within post-common envelope binary systems. We also find, through both spectral energy distribution and $\it{TESS}$ light curve analyses, that the WD has a radius of $1.54\pm 0.07 R_{\oplus}$, roughly $12\sigma$ larger than the expected value from WD mass-radius relationships. Both the Lomb-Scargle analysis and the $v \sin{i}$ of the system indicate the main-sequence companion to be super-synchronously rotating at a period of $\sim$6 days, which may suggest accretion occurred during the evolution of the system. This binary also shares similar physical characteristics with six other post-common envelope systems hosting massive WDs, which may point to a shared formation pathway. We model the history of this system with COSMIC and find that it likely formed through an episode of common envelope evolution following the onset of mass transfer when the progenitor primary was on either the early or the thermally pulsing stages of the asymptotic giant branch. As a result of its properties, the study of 2M07515777+1807352 can provide new insights regarding many key outstanding questions in our understanding of common envelope evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Supernova Remnant G284.3$-$1.8 and Its Relation to the Gamma-ray Binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856</a><span class="id">[2601.14801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>G284.3$-$1.8 is a supernova remnant with a radio shell and thermal X-ray emission. Located near its center is the gamma-ray binary 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, although the physical association between the two systems is not clear yet. Our X-ray spectroscopy with Suzaku reveals that G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 have compatible absorption column densities of $N_\mathrm{H} = 6\textrm{--}7 \times 10^{21}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}$, indicating that the two systems have similar distances. The actual distance is determined as $3~\mathrm{kpc}$ using $\mathrm{^{12}CO}$ ($J=1\textrm{--}0$) data obtained with NANTEN. The X-ray spectrum of G284.3$-$1.8 shows a strong K-shell emission line of Mg, confirming that the earlier claim that the SNR is one of the few Mg-rich SNRs. Comparing recent stellar models taking into account the &quot;shell merger&quot; processes, we find that the obtained Mg-to-Ne mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Mg}/M_\mathrm{Ne} = 0.73^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ and Si-to-Mg mass ratio of $M_\mathrm{Si}/M_\mathrm{Mg} = 0.44\pm0.03$ suggest a supernova explosion that would have left a neutron star. The characteristics of 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856, on the other hand, are better explained with a model in which its compact object is neutron star. The present results, therefore, would suggest a possible scenario where G284.3$-$1.8 and 1FGL J1018.6$-$5856 are both remnants of a common supernova explosion although further observational tests are necessary.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02286" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining electromagnetic couplings of ultralight scalars from compact stars</a><span class="id">[2501.02286]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>If an ultralight scalar interacts with the electromagnetic fields of a compact rotating star, then a long-range scalar field is developed outside the star. The Coulomb-like profile of the scalar field to the leading order is equivalent to an effective scalar charge on the star. In a binary star system, the scalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars, with the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions would modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum, resulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an apparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would also induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the electromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field sourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from a compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down luminosity. We constrain the scalar-photon coupling from the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation of a compact star and from its spin-down luminosity, using the Crab pulsar, the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and the gamma ray burst GRB 080905A. We also project the prospective bounds on the coupling from future measurements of the long-range force between two compact stars in a binary such as PSR J0737-3039, and from the apparent redshifts of compact stars. Future advances in precision-clock sensitivity and targeted observations of stars with strong surface magnetic fields, large radii, and low-frequency emission can substantially tighten these coupling limits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">67.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X</a><span class="id">[2508.15891]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM.

In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X).

Here we investigate the behaviour of convection-driven dynamos reaching a MAC (magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis) balance on the convective length scale and compare the results with non-magnetic convection cases. In particular, the dependence of physical quantities on the Ekman number, $Ek$, is studied in detail. The scaling of velocity dependent quantities is observed to be independent of the force balance and in agreement with quasi-geostrophic theory. The primary difference between dynamo and non-magnetic cases is that the fluctuating temperature is order unity in the former such that the buoyancy force scales with the Coriolis force. The MAC state yields a scaling for the flow speeds that is identical to the so-called CIA (Coriolis-inertia-Archimedes) scaling. There is an $O(Ek^{1/3})$ length scale present within the velocity field irrespective of the leading order force balance. This length scale is consistent with the asymptotic scaling of the terms of the governing equations and is not an indication that viscosity plays a dominant role. The peak of the kinetic energy spectrum and the ohmic dissipation length scale both exhibit an Ekman number dependence of approximately $Ek^{1/6}$, which is consistent with a scaling of $Rm^{-1/2}$, where $Rm$ is the magnetic Reynolds number. For the dynamos, advection remains comparable to, and scales similarly with, both inertia and viscosity, implying that nonlinear convective Rossby waves play an important role in the dynamics even in a MAC regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</a><span class="id">[2510.02163]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors.

In the presence of a magnetic field, the oscillating axion field acts as a coherent temporal drive, inducing resonant photon-axion conversion when the mismatch between their dispersion relations is compensated by integer harmonics of the axion oscillation frequency, $\Delta_\gamma - \Delta_a \approx n m_a$ with $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. This driven resonance enables efficient mixing far from the conventional level-crossing regime and disappears entirely upon time averaging, explaining why it is missed in standard treatments. The process constitutes a unitary mode-conversion phenomenon that preserves the axion dark matter number density and is distinct from parametric instabilities or axion decay. A systematic description is naturally provided by Floquet theory.

The solar wind velocity of 200 kilometers per second and ion temperature of 25 eV were significantly reduced as compared to their values in the ambient solar wind. These anomalous plasma conditions were observed on closed magnetic field lines, as determined from observations of the suprathermal electron strahl. Because the polarity of the radial magnetic field did not change sign on the two sides of the crossing and the crossed region contained a double-peaked plasma structure, the spacecraft must have passed through the base of a pseudo-streamer whose structure extended out to 10 solar radii. In the plasma frame, an electric field as large as 400 millivolts per meter was detected during the crossing. The current associated with this electric field was less than one milliampere per square meter, corresponding to a drift velocity less than 2.5 kilometers per second. It also contained a turbulent plasma with density fluctuations divided by density as large as 0.3, suggesting that the resistive term in the generalized ohm's law was significant. Also, the density as a function of time had a non-zero slope when the electric field was non-zero, suggesting that the pressure gradient term also mattered. As compared to earlier remote sensing and theoretical results, it is surprising that the plasma in this pseudo-streamer had a remarkably low flow velocity and that the pseudo-streamer base extended out to 10 solar radii.</p></div></details></article></body>
