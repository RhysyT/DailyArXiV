<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Types of Natural Kind Discovery: Nobel Meets Kuhn</a><span class="id">[2510.09069]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Philosophers have spilled much ink over the discovery of ideas in the classical 'context of discovery'. However, there has been little engagement with the question of what constitutes a discovery of 'things in the world'. A much-overlooked answer to this question is provided by T.S. Kuhn. In this paper, I show that discoveries awarded with a Nobel Prize in Physics in the past 53 years accord with a basic premise of Kuhn's account and his distinction between two types of natural kind discoveries. I also draw normative conclusions for credit attribution in science.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10959" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disentangling Boltzmann brains, the time-asymmetry of memory, and the second law</a><span class="id">[2507.10959]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Are you, with your perceptions, memories and observational data, a Boltzmann brain, i.e., a statistical fluctuation out of the thermal equilibrium of the universe? Arguments are given in the literature for and against taking this hypothesis seriously. Complicating these analyses have been the many subtle - and very often implicit - entanglements between related arguments that have been given for the past hypothesis, the second law, and even Bayesian inference of the reliability of experimental data. These entanglements can easily lead to circular reasoning. To help disentangle those arguments, since almost all of them involve Boltzmann's H theorem, we begin by formalizing the H theorem as a time-symmetric, time-translation invariant Markov process over the entropy values of the universe. Crucially, this process does not specify the time(s) on which we should condition it in order to infer the stochastic dynamics of our universe's entropy. Any such choice of conditioning events must be introduced as an independent assumption. This observation allows us to disentangle the standard Boltzmann brain hypothesis, its &quot;1000CE&quot; variant, the past hypothesis, the second law, and the reliability of our experimental data, all in a fully formal manner. In particular, we show that they all adopt the H theorem's stipulation that the universe's entropy evolves as a Markov processes, and all make an arbitrary assumption that the process should be conditioned on a single moment in time. Their only difference is what single time to condition on. In this aspect, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis and the second law are equally legitimate (or not).</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Are science exhibitions for everyone? Accessibility aspects of the CERN Science Gateway exhibitions</a><span class="id">[2510.08584]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>CERN's new flagship education and outreach centre, Science Gateway, opened its doors to the public in autumn 2023. Through a combination of immersive scenography with interactive exhibits and real scientific objects, its permanent exhibitions address the organisation's particle physics research and how this knowledge applies to other scientific fields and the visitor's everyday life. While in Discover CERN visitors learn about the accelerator and detector technologies at CERN, Our Universe covers the evolution of the Universe and the role that fundamental physics plays in it, as well as open questions in modern physics. Their underlying basic quantum mechanical principles can eventually be explored in Quantum World. Firstly, we will give a short overview of the exhibitions' highlights. Next, we delve into how various aspects of accessibility were incorporated into the exhibition development process to target the broadest audience possible and to inspire the next generation of scientists. We give an account on how this topic was approached and how inclusive exhibits and infrastructure were realised. By combining long-term visitor statistics and preliminary results of a recent visitor survey, we obtain insights about the actual audience and the visitors' perceived accessibility of the exhibitions with respect to their educational backgrounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Teachers' Perceptions of ChatGPT Through Prompt Engineering</a><span class="id">[2510.08634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Artificial Intelligence and especially Large Language Models (LLM), such as ChatGPT has revolutionized the way educators work. The results we get from LLMs depend on how we ask them to help us. The process and the technique behind an effective input is called prompt engineering. The aim of this study is to investigate whether science educators in secondary education improve their attitude toward ChatGPT as a learning assistant after appropriate training in prompt engineering. The results of the pilot study presented in this paper show an improvement in the previously mentioned teachers perceptions.</p></div></details></article></body>
