<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09846" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using Oral Exams in Physics and Astronomy Courses</a><span class="id">[2509.09846]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Oral exams were common historically across academia, though their popularity has recently fallen. Many argue against them as an assessment technique because they are vulnerable to bias and subjectivity, difficult to administer, and impractical in large college classes. I present a method for administering oral examinations in upper-level courses that mitigates some of the disadvantages. This method creates a rigid question structure meant to assess student mastery of material, have a well-defined grading structure to standardize evaluation, and be administered a constrained time limit to reduce workload in larger seminars. I emphasize holistic verbal communication and evaluation that is meant to mirror the talks and interviews that are common throughout a scientist's career.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which Rope Breaks?

For a two-rope system, we demonstrate how the breaking scenario depends on the applied force dynamics: rapid pulling causes the lower rope to break, while gradual pulling leads to upper rope failure. Extending to a three-rope Y-shaped configuration, we identify a critical angle theta_C=60° that determines which rope breaks first. When the angle between the upper ropes exceeds this critical value, the upper ropes fail before the lower one. We further analyze how an attached mass at the junction point modifies this critical angle and establish maximum mass limits for valid solutions. Our results provide practical insights for introductory physics students understanding static forces and system stabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Computational modeling of diffusive dynamics in a bouncer system with an irregular surface</a><span class="id">[2509.10253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The horizontal dynamics of a bouncing ball interacting with an irregular surface is investigated and is found to demonstrate behavior analogous to a random walk. Its stochastic character is substantiated by the calculation of a permutation entropy. The probability density function associated with the particle positions evolves to a Gaussian distribution, and the second moment follows a power-law dependence on time, indicative of diffusive behavior. The results emphasize that deterministic systems with complex geometries or nonlinearities can generate behavior that is statistically indistinguishable from random. Several problems are suggested to extend the analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unveiling Gender Dynamics in Introductory Physics Labs</a><span class="id">[2509.10299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The persistent underrepresentation of women and gender minorities within the physical sciences remains a significant issue. This study investigates gender dynamics in introductory algebra-based physics laboratories, focusing on participation, task preferences, and comfort levels. Statistical analysis revealed no significant gender difference in overall participation rates during lab activities. However, significant gender-based disparities emerged in both task preference (\(\chi^2 = 9.548,~ p = 0.023\)) and comfort levels (\(\chi^2 = 7.906,~ p = 0.048\)). Male students significantly preferred and felt more comfortable with hands-on equipment handling and data collection, whereas female students more frequently preferred and reported higher comfort with analytical and documentation tasks like note-taking, calculations, and report writing. Qualitative responses highlighted additional challenges reported by some women, including exclusion from group discussions and reluctance to contribute ideas in male-dominated groups. These findings suggest that while overall participation may appear gender-neutral, gendered patterns in task allocation and comfort persist. The results underscore the need for instructional strategies that promote equitable engagement and foster inclusive laboratory environments in physics education.</p></div></details></article>
