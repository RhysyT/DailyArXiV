Unlike previously studied mergers involving higher-mass HeCO WDs and CO WDs, where helium detonation often triggers core ignition, our simulations reveal incomplete helium shell detonations in comparable-mass, lower-mass WD pairs. The result is a faint, rapidly evolving transient driven by the ejection of intermediate-mass elements and radioactive isotopes such as $^{48}$Cr and $^{52}$Fe, without significant $^{56}$Ni production. These transients may be detectable in upcoming wide-field surveys and could account for a subset of faint thermonuclear supernovae. Long-term evolution of the merger remnant shows that high-velocity PG-1159-type stars might be formed through this scenario, similar to normal CO-CO white dwarf mergers. This work expands our understanding of white dwarf mergers and their implications for nucleosynthesis and stellar evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of internal versus external perturbations on close-in exoplanet architectures</a><span class="id">[2510.03401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Young planetary systems are subjected to different dynamical effects that can influence their orbital structure over time. In systems with more than one planet, other planets can internally influence each other, e.g. via planet-planet scattering. External perturbing effects also need to be taken into account, as stars do not form by themselves but together with other stars in young star-forming regions. This birth environment can externally affect young multi-planet systems, e.g. via fly-bys. Previous work has shown that the absence/presence and location of an outer giant planet around a close-in planet system do not change how these inner planets react to a single fly-by with another star. We further explore this by comparing the effects of these external perturbations on four close-in sub-Neptune planets to those caused by a situation where only the distant giant is perturbed by the same kind of encounter. Our results indicate that the close-in planet systems have a &quot;preferred&quot; end state after 500 Myr, which is reached regardless of how it was perturbed. In addition, the mass of the giant appears not to impact the reaction of the inner planet system in the scenario of an external perturbation in our tested set-ups, i.e. either a single 1 or 5 M_Jup giant placed at 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 au. However, the mass affects the subsequent evolution of the inner planets if only internal perturbations by the giant are considered. The reduction in mass leads to an absence of collisions during the 500 Myr.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03402" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as very massive star core-collapse events</a><span class="id">[2510.03402]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes, mergers of black holes and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. In this paper, we explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive black holes via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins for LFBOTs. We explore the formation rate of massive black holes in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of black holes with mass greater than  30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these black holes are biased to low metallicity (Z&lt;0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the prototypical LFBOT AT2018cow) can plausibly be produced in these events. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for LFBOTs. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in this scenario overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute non-negligibly to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03409" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harnessing the XMM-Newton data: X-ray spectral modelling of 4XMM-DR11 detections and 4XMM-DR11s sources</a><span class="id">[2510.03409]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The XMM-Newton X-ray observatory has played a prominent role in astrophysics, conducting precise and thorough observations of the X-ray sky for the past two decades. The most recent iteration of the 4XMM catalogue and one of its latest data releases DR11 mark significant improvements over previous XMM-Newton catalogues, serving as a cornerstone for comprehending the diverse inhabitants of the X-ray sky. We employ detections and spectra extracted from the 4XMM-DR11 catalogue, subjecting them to fitting procedures using simple models. Our study operates within the framework of the XMM2ATHENA project, which focuses on developing state-of-the-art methods that exploit existing XMM-Newton data. We introduce and publicly release four catalogues containing measurements derived from X-ray spectral modelling of sources. The first catalogue encompasses outcomes obtained by fitting an absorbed power law model to all the extracted spectra for individual detections within the 4XMM-DR11 dataset. The second catalogue presents results obtained by fitting both an absorbed power law and an absorbed blackbody model to all unique physical sources listed in the 4XMM-DR11s catalogue, which documents source detection results from overlapping XMM-Newton observations. For the third catalogue we use the five band count rates derived from the pipe line detection of X-ray sources to mimic low resolution spectra to get a rough estimate of the spectral shape (absorbed power-law) of all 4XMM-DR11 detections. In the fourth catalogue, we conduct spectral analyses for the subset of identified sources with extracted spectra, employing various models based on their classification into categories such as AGN, stars, X-ray binaries, and cataclysmic variables. The scientific potential of these catalogues is highlighted by discussing the capabilities of optical and mid-infrared colours for selecting absorbed AGN.

Calibrators with the most reliable distances were selected through an extensive literature search. The calibration is performed using kernel smoothing of the selected sample of calibrators in $\Sigma-D$ plane and an orthogonal offsets fitting procedure. We use the obtained calibration to derive the distances to 164 Galactic SNRs and 27 new detected SNRs/SNR candidates with none or poor distance estimates. The analysis given in this paper confirms the expected predictions from our previous papers that the kernel smoothing method is more reliable for SNR distance calibration than the orthogonal offset fitting method, except for the distance determinations of the very low brightness SNRs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03428" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atmospheric pion, kaon, and muon fluxes for sub-orbital experiments</a><span class="id">[2510.03428]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic rays interacting with the Earth's atmosphere generate extensive air showers, which produce Cherenkov, fluorescence and radio emissions. These emissions are key signatures for detection by ground-based, sub-orbital, and satellite-based telescopes aiming to study high energy cosmic ray and neutrino events. However, detectors operating at ground and balloon altitudes are also exposed to a background of atmospheric charged particles, primarily pions, kaons, and muons, that can mimic or obscure the signals from astrophysical sources. In this work, we use coupled cascade equations to calculate the atmospheric pion, kaon and muon fluxes reaching detectors at various altitudes. Our analysis focuses on energies above 10 GeV, where the influence of the Earth's magnetic field on particle trajectories is minimal. We provide angular and energy-resolved flux estimates and discuss their relevance as background for extensive air shower detection. Our results are potentially relevant for interpreting data from current and future balloon-borne experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 and for refining trigger and veto strategies in Cherenkov and fluorescence telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vision-Based CNN Prediction of Sunspot Numbers from SDO/HMI Images</a><span class="id">[2510.03473]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sunspot numbers constitute the longest and most widely used record of solar activity, with direct implications for space weather forecasting and heliophysical research. Traditional sunspot counting relies on visual inspection or algorithmic feature detection, both of which are limited by subjectivity, image quality, and methodological inconsistencies. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable the direct use of solar imagery for automated prediction tasks, reducing reliance on manual feature engineering. In this work, we present a supervised vision-based regression framework to estimate daily sunspot numbers from full-disk continuum images acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Images from 2011-2024 were paired with daily sunspot numbers from the SILSO Version 2.0 dataset of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. After preprocessing and augmentation, a CNN was trained to predict scalar sunspot counts directly from pixel data. The proposed model achieved strong predictive performance, with R2 = 0.986 and RMSE = 6.25 on the test set, indicating close agreement with SILSO reference values. Comparative evaluation against prior studies shows that our approach performs competitively with, and in several cases outperforms, statistical and hybrid machine learning methods, while offering the novel advantage of bypassing explicit detection and manual feature extraction. Interpretability analyses using Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients confirmed that the network consistently attends to sunspot regions when forming predictions. These results highlight the potential of deep vision-based approaches for operational solar monitoring, providing a scalable and automated pathway for real-time estimation of classical heliophysical indices</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03517" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Covariant cosmography in the presence of local structures: comparing exact solutions and perturbation theory</a><span class="id">[2510.03517]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observational evidence of axially symmetric anisotropies in the local cosmic expansion rate motivates an investigation of whether they can be accounted for within the Lemaître-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) framework with an off-center observer. Within this setting, we compute the exact relativistic luminosity distance via the Sachs equation and compare it with the approximate expression obtained from the covariant cosmographic approach (including Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters). This comparison allows us to identify the regimes in which the covariant cosmographic method remains reliable. In addition, we compare the LTB relativistic distance for small inhomogeneities with the corresponding result derived from linear perturbation theory (LPT) in the standard cosmological model. This analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the LTB and LPT approaches, offering a consistent dictionary for the interpretation of the observed anisotropies of the large-scale gravitational field. This analysis will be instrumental in interpreting expansion-rate anisotropies, facilitating investigations of the local Universe beyond the FLRW framework with a fully non-perturbative metric approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GRMHD modelling of accretion flow around Sagittarius A$^*$ constrained by EHT measurements</a><span class="id">[2510.03602]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study low angular momentum, advective accretion flows around a Kerr black hole within the framework of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) in the steady state. By solving the full set of GRMHD equations, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of the behavior of magnetized plasma in the strong gravity regime near a rotating black hole. The accretion solutions are obtained for a set of input parameters, namely energy (${\cal E}$), angular momentum (${\cal L}$), magnetic flux ($\Phi$), and isorotation parameter ($I$). By systematically varying these parameters, we generate a family of global GRMHD accretion solutions that characterize the physical environment around the black hole. Using this approach, we investigate whether the inferred magnetic field strengths reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) for Sagittarius A$^*$ at various radii can be reproduced. We find that, for a broad range of parameter values, our model successfully recovers the EHT inferred magnetic field strengths with an accuracy of approximately $10\%$, offering a self-consistent framework for interpreting near-horizon accretion physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03655" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effect of a Fine-Scale Layered Structure of the Atmosphere on Infrasound Signals from Fragmenting Meteoroids</a><span class="id">[2510.03655]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the influence of a fine-scale (FS) layered structure in the atmosphere on the propagation of infrasound signals generated by fragmenting meteoroids. Using a pseudo-differential parabolic equation (PPE) approach, we model broadband acoustic signals from point sources at altitudes of 35-100 km. The presence of FS fluctuations in the stratosphere (37-45 km) and the lower thermosphere (100-120 km) modifies ray trajectories, causing multiple arrivals and prolonged signal durations at ground stations. In particular, meteoroids fragmenting at 80-100 km can produce two distinct thermospheric arrivals beyond 150km range, while meteoroids descending to 50 km or below yield weak, long-lived arrivals within the acoustic shadow zone via antiguiding propagation and diffraction. Comparison with observed infrasound data confirms that FS-layered inhomogeneities can account for multi-arrival &quot;N-waves,&quot; broadening potential interpretations of meteoroid signals. The results also apply to other atmospheric-entry objects, such as sample return capsules, emphasizing how FS structure impacts shock wave propagation. Our findings advance understanding of wavefield evolution in a layered atmosphere and have broad relevance for global infrasound monitoring of diverse phenomena (e.g., re-entry capsules, rocket launches, and large-scale explosions).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03702" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VHE $γ$-ray observations of bright BL Lacs with the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the CTAO</a><span class="id">[2510.03702]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) is the next-generation ground-based gamma-ray observatory operating in the energy range from 20 GeV up to 300 TeV, with two sites in La Palma (Spain) and Paranal (Chile). It will consist of telescopes of three sizes, covering different parts of the large energy range. We report on the performance of Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) in the detection and characterization of extragalactic gamma-ray sources, with a focus on the reconstructed gamma-ray spectra and variability of classical bright BL Lacertae objects, which were observed during the early commissioning phase of the instrument. LST-1 data from known bright gamma-ray blazars - Markarian 421, Markarian 501, 1ES 1959+650, 1ES 0647+250, and PG 1553+113 - were collected between July 10, 2020, and May 23, 2022, covering a zenith angle range of 4 deg to 57 deg. The reconstructed light curves were analyzed using a Bayesian block algorithm to distinguish the different activity phases of each blazar. Simultaneous Fermi-LAT data were utilized to reconstruct the broadband $\gamma$-ray spectra for the sources during each activity phase. High-level reconstructed data in a format compatible with gammapy are provided together with measured light curves and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for several bright blazars and an interpretation of the observed variability in long and short timescales. Simulations of historical flares are generated to evaluate the sensitivity of LST-1. This work represents the first milestone in monitoring bright BL Lacertae objects with a CTAO telescope.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03742" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting Gaussian Process Reconstruction for Cosmological Inference: The Generalised GP (Gen GP) Framework</a><span class="id">[2510.03742]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate uncertainties in the estimation of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) arising from Gaussian Process (GP) reconstruction, demonstrating that the choice of kernel introduces systematic variations comparable to those arising from different cosmological models. To address this limitation, we introduce the Generalized Gaussian Process (Gen GP) framework, in which the Matérn smoothness parameter $\nu$ is treated as a free parameter, allowing for data-driven kernel optimization. Using the cosmic chronometer Hubble data, we find that while standard GP with $\Lambda$CDM mean function exhibits noticeable reconstruction differences between optimized and marginalized approaches, particularly at $z &gt; 1$, Gen GP maintains methodological consistency. In Gen GP, slight increases in $\chi^2$ per degree of freedom relative to standard GP, for both the zero-mean and $\Lambda$CDM prior mean cases, reflect added flexibility rather than performance degradation. Our results emphasize that robust cosmological inference requires treating kernel parameters as free variables and implementing full Bayesian marginalization to avoid artificial precision from fixed hyperparameters. As machine learning becomes central to cosmological discovery, the Gen GP framework provides a principled approach to model-independent inference that properly accounts for methodological uncertainties while maintaining necessary flexibility for reliable parameter estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03779" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond CPL: Evidence for dynamical dark energy in three-parameter models</a><span class="id">[2510.03779]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We introduce three-parameter extensions of the two-parameter minimal Akhtar-Hossain (mAH) parametrization, termed modified minimal AH (MmAH1,2), which provide greater flexibility in the dynamics of dark energy. These models are compared with $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, mAH, CPL, and three-parameter CPL (CPL-$w_{\rm b}$) using a joint data set of the CMB compressed likelihood, DESI DR2, Pantheon$+$ supernovae, $H(z)$ measurements, and redshift-space distortions. While the common cosmological parameters remain stable across models, CPL and the MmAH1,2 yield modest improvements in fit, with $\Delta\chi^2\simeq -6$ to $-7$ and corresponding $\Delta{\rm AIC}\simeq -1$ to $-2$ relative to $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a mild preference for dynamical dark energy. Statistical consistency with $\Lambda$CDM is quantified via the Mahalanobis distance in one, two, and three dimensional parameter subspaces. In 1D, the strongest deviation occurs for MmAH1 ($2.5\sigma$), followed by CPL ($2.3\sigma$). In 2D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ shows the highest discrepancy ($2.3\sigma$), while other models remain at the $1.7$-$2.1\sigma$ level. In 3D, CPL-$w_{\rm b}$ continues to exhibit the largest tension ($\sim2\sigma$), though this arises in the presence of very strong correlations, particularly between $w_{\rm a}$ and $w_{\rm b}$, whereas the MmAH extensions display slightly weaker but still non-negligible discrepancies ($1.4$-$1.8\sigma$). Overall, these results indicate consistent evidence for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03916" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observation of undepleted phosphine in the atmosphere of a low-temperature brown dwarf</a><span class="id">[2510.03916]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The atmospheres of low-temperature brown dwarfs and gas giant planets are expected to contain the phosphine molecule, PH$_3$ However, previous observations have shown much lower abundances of this molecule than predicted by atmospheric chemistry models.

However, the $D_H/r_d$ ratio shows a decreasing trend with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ at $2.3 \sigma$ to $2.5 \sigma$ that cannot be explained by physics. We demonstrate that the result does not depend on the choice of cosmological model, but the radius of the sound horizon $r_d$ has a much greater influence.

The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization – a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state – displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parameterizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parameterization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parameterizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Limiting the Yukawa Gravity through the Black Hole Shadows of Sgr A* and M87*</a><span class="id">[2510.04210]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, the \textit{EHT} collaboration unveiled the shadow images of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) M87* and Sgr A*, with angular radii of $42\pm3$ $\mu$as and $48.7\pm7.0$ $\mu$as, respectively. These observations are consistent with the shadow of a Kerr black hole in general relativity (GR). Observations of the shadow of SMBHs can be used to test modified gravity theories, including Yukawa gravity, in extremely strong fields. In this paper, we illustrate the shadows of Yukawa black holes, showing that their sizes are significantly influenced by the Yukawa parameters $\lambda$ and $\kappa$. Using the EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*, we obtain constraints on the Yukawa parameters. For Sgr A*, Keck and VLTI provide different priors on its gravitational radius. The Sgr A* shadow yields $\kappa=-0.04^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $\lambda&gt;1$ AU with the Keck prior, while $\kappa=-0.08^{+0.09}_{-0.06}$ with the VLTI prior. As $\lambda$ decreases, the constraints weaken, reaching $-0.37&lt;\kappa &lt;0.17$ (Keck prior) and $-0.47&lt;\kappa&lt;0.04$ (VLTI prior) at $\lambda=0.1$ AU. For M87*, with a mass significantly larger than Sgr A*, this system can only put constraints on $\kappa$ at larger $\lambda$. For $\lambda&gt;1.5\times10^4$ AU, the \textit{EHT} observation of M87* yields $\kappa=-0.01^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$. No significant deviation from GR is detected in our analysis. Additionally, we explore potential constraints using the next-generation VLBI, like \textit{ngEHT} and the Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), which promise the detection of the second ring of photons. The improved angular resolution and the measurements of the second ring could substantially refine constraints on the Yukawa parameters, enhancing our ability to test deviations from GR in the strong-field regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical Modeling of Prominences and Coronal Rain with the MPI-AMRVAC Code</a><span class="id">[2510.04222]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This review surveys recent advances in the numerical modeling of solar prominences and coronal rain achieved with the fully open-source adaptive-grid, parallelized Adaptive Mesh Refinement Versatile Advection Code (MPI-AMRVAC).

CTA 1 is on the cusp of middle age ( 13 kyr) and spatially resolvable at energies visible to imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs), such as the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS) (PSF &lt; 0.1 deg). Therefore, this remnant is an excellent candidate to study lepton propagation and escape between different PWN evolutionary stages. Since the initial VERITAS publication on CTA 1 in 2013, VERITAS has performed new observations, adding to a total exposure of about 120 hours.

Here, we introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\odot$ at distances from a few Mpc to 100 Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\circ}$ corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision. We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\circ}$, which we find in this optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04565" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ten new, ultracompact triply eclipsing triple star systems</a><span class="id">[2510.04565]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have identified more than a hundred close triply eclipsing hierarchical triple star systems from data taken with the space telescope TESS. Many of them have outer periods less than or, close to 100 days, hence, we call them `ultracompact hierarchical triples'. These systems are noteworthy in that we can potentially determine their dynamical and astrophysical parameters with a high precision, in many cases even without radial velocity data. In the present paper we report the comprehensive study of ten new ultracompact triply eclipsing triple star systems, located in the northern ecliptic hemisphere, taken from this larger sample: TICs 198581208, 265274458, 283846096, 337993842, 351404069, 378270875, 403792414, 403916758, 405789362, 461500036. Most of the data for this study come from TESS observations, but we obtained supplemental ground-based photometric measurements for two of the systems. The eclipse timing variation curves extracted from the TESS and the ground-based follow up data, the photometric light curves, and the spectral energy distribution are combined in a complex photodynamical analysis to yield the stellar and orbital parameters of all ten systems. The outer periods are in the range of 46.8-101.4 days. We found third-body forced, rapid apsidal motion in four systems. Moreover, TIC 403916758 was found to be a double twin triple (i.e. both the inner and the outer mass ratios are close to unity). All of the systems are substantially flat, with mutual inclination angles of $&lt;5^o$. Finally, we have taken the results for the ten systems in the present paper, and combined them with the system parameters for more than 30 other compact triples that we have reported on in previous work, in order to examine some of the global properties of these systems on a statistical basis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04570" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of supernova explosions within extragalactic jets</a><span class="id">[2510.04570]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Jets in active galactic nuclei have to cross significant distances within their host galaxies, meeting large numbers of stars of different masses and evolution stages in their paths. Given enough time, supernova explosions within the jet will eventually happen, and may have a strong impact on its dynamics, potentially triggering powerful non-thermal activity. We carried out a detailed numerical study to explore the dynamics of the interaction between the ejecta of a supernova explosion and a relativistic extragalactic jet. By means of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations using the code RATPENAT, we simulated the jet-ejecta interaction in two different geometries or scenarios: a two-dimensional, axisymmetric simulation, and a three-dimensional one, which includes the orbital velocity of the exploding star. Although initially filling a region much smaller than the jet radius, the ejecta expands and eventually covers most of the jet cross section. The expansion is enhanced as more energy from the jet is converted into kinetic and internal energy of the ejecta, which also favors the ejecta disruption, all this occurring on timescales   10^4 yr. Although a complete numerical convergence of the results is unattainable given the subsonic, turbulent nature of the interaction region, the simulations are consistent in their description of the gross morphological and dynamical properties of the interaction process. At the end of the simulations, the supernova ejecta has already partially mixed with the relativistic jet. The results also suggest that the jet-ejecta interaction may be a non-negligible non-thermal emitter. Moreover, due to efficient mixing, the interaction region can be a potential source of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays of heavy composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04586" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A type II solar radio burst without a coronal mass ejection association</a><span class="id">[2510.04586]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Type II solar radio bursts are commonly associated with shocks generated by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), where plasma waves are excited by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes and converted into radio waves at the local plasma frequency or its harmonics. However, there are instances where type II bursts occur in the absence of whitelight CMEs. We analysed one such metric type II radio burst observed on November 2, 2023, characterized by split band features and fundamental-harmonic lanes. Notably, no CME was detected with space-based coronagraphs during this event. However, an intense M1.6 class flare was observed just before the type II burst and an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) disturbance was observed expanding into surrounding regions. The absence of any whitelight CME seen in any coronagraph field of view even though the EUV shock had a moderate speed of $\approx500~km/s$, which was close to the shock speed derived from radio observations, %indicates that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely produced by the very intense solar flare and the type II was associated with the EUV disturbance seen in the lower corona. These observations indicate that the shock in the inner corona was most-likely driven by the EUV ejecta seen in the lower corona, but the ejecta did not survive as a CME in the coronagraph field of view.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04635" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Role of Acoustic Instability in Cosmic-Ray Self-Confinement</a><span class="id">[2510.04635]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Over the past decades, there has been growing observational and theoretical evidence that cosmic-ray-induced instabilities play an important role in both acceleration and transport of cosmic rays (CRs). For instance, the efficient acceleration of charged particles at supernova remnant shocks requires rapidly growing instabilities, so much so that none of the proposed processes seem sufficient to warrant acceleration to PeV energies. In this work, we investigate whether an acoustic instability triggered by the presence of a CR pressure gradient can lead to significant self-confinement of charged particles in the vicinity of shocks. We validate the expected growth rates and obtain the scale and energy of magnetic field perturbations induced by such system using magnetohydrodynamical simulations. Our results suggest a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient for particles with Larmor radius around a thousandth of the precursor scale length.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Combining the second data release of the European Pulsar Timing Array with low-frequency pulsar data</a><span class="id">[2510.04639]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low-frequency radio data improve the sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) variations, enabling better noise characterization essential for detecting the stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). We combined LOFAR (100-200 MHz) and NenuFAR (30-90 MHz) observations with the recent European and Indian PTA release (DR2new+) into a new dataset, DR2low, spanning  11 years for 12 pulsars. DR2low allows updated noise models, increasing PTA sensitivity to the GWB. Using Libstempo and Enterprise, we applied standard noise models including red noise (RN) and time-variable DM (DMv) as power laws, and performed Bayesian model selection over RN, DMv, and an additional chromatic noise term (CN4). Compared to DR2new+, DR2low improves DM constraints and separates DM and RN contributions. We found that the RN is required in the final model for 10 out of 12 pulsars, compared to only 5 in the DR2new+ dataset. The improved sensitivity to plasma effects provided by DR2low also favors the identification of significant CN4 in eight pulsars, while none showed such evidence in DR2new+. The analysis also reveals unmodelled solar wind effects, particularly near solar conjunction, with residual delays absorbed into the DM component, highlighting the importance of accurately modelling the solar wind in PTA datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04680" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Quasi-Periodic Pulsations Driven by Structural Oscillations in a Kink-Unstable Flaring Coronal Loop</a><span class="id">[2510.04680]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Twisted coronal loops in the solar atmosphere may become kink-unstable when their magnetic field lines are sufficiently twisted. This instability can trigger magnetic reconnection, leading to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, which manifests as a solar flare. Previous research has demonstrated that oscillations in microwave emissions, resembling observed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs), can be generated by the reconnecting loop. Our aim is to investigate the relationship between the oscillations of the loop and these microwave pulsations. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations, we examine two models: a straight loop in a uniform-density atmosphere and a curved loop in a gravitationally stratified atmosphere. Using new methodology, we extract the reconnecting loop-top from both models and identify structural oscillations. We then compare these oscillations with the gyrosynchrotron (GS) radiation emitted from the simulations, which is forward-modelled using a radiative transfer code. We find that oscillations in the GS emissions are driven by sausage and kink-mode oscillations. However, the relationship between the oscillation frequencies of the GS emission and the identified loop oscillation modes is complex. The dominant mode in the former may result from interference between sausage-mode and kink-mode oscillations or entirely different mechanisms. Results such as these increase our understanding of the time-dependent behaviour of solar flares and lay the groundwork for potential diagnostic tools that could be used to determine physical parameters within a flaring loop</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions</a><span class="id">[2510.04684]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extra radiation injection after neutrino decoupling in the early Universe contributes to the effective number of neutrino species that can be constrained by the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

We consider neutrinogenic CMB spectral distortions, where extra energy is released in the form of neutrinos but still creates the CMB spectral distortions via electroweak interactions. The synergy between the effective neutrino number and CMB spectral distortions provides a complementary probe of hidden sectors that dominantly couple to neutrinos, opening up parameter space that can be targeted by joint CMB anisotropy and spectral distortion experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic instantons and the tail of the inflationary density perturbation</a><span class="id">[2510.04707]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the &quot;stochastic $\delta N$ formalism&quot;, the statistics of the inflationary density perturbation are obtained from the first passage distribution of a stochastic process. We develop a general framework in which to evaluate the rare tail of this distribution, based on an instanton approximation to a path integral representation for the transition probability. We relate our formalism to the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, by integrating out short wavelength degrees of freedom to produce an influence functional. This provides a principled way to extend the calculation beyond the slow-roll limit, and to models with multiple fields. We argue that our framework has a number of advantages in comparison with existing methods. In particular, it reliably captures the tail behaviour in cases where existing techniques do not apply, including cases where the noise amplitude has strong time dependence. We demonstrate the method by computing the tail probability in a number of scenarios, including a beyond-slow-roll analysis of a linear potential, ultra-slow-roll, and constant-roll inflation. We find close agreement with results already reported in the literature. Finally, we discuss a scenario with exponentially decaying noise amplitude. This is a model for the stochastic evolution of a fixed comoving volume of spacetime on superhorizon scales. In this case we show that the tail reverts to a Gaussian weight.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing the variability of a sample of massive stars in eclipsing binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.04746]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars exhibit a perplexing mismatch between their inferred masses from different observational techniques, posing a significant challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution and structure. This discrepancy is believed to be caused by the underestimation of the convective core masses. The efficiency of such measurement is usually impaired by a lot of processes at work in the interior of the stars such as convective core overshooting and interior rotation. By integrating the precision of asteroseismology which provides insights into the internal structure and dynamics of stars, with the detailed observational constraints offered by eclipsing binary systems, this study aims to precisely characterize a sample of massive stars in eclipsing binaries to infer their properties and evolutionary state. In this paper, the sample, observed photometrically with TESS and spectroscopically with SALT HRS, CHIRON, HERMES and a spectrograph at Skalnate Pleso Observatory between 2021 and 2024, are analyzed. The orbital elements as well as the basic stellar parameters of the targets in the sample are fitted to derive the geometry of their orbits as well as their absolute parameters. The asteroseismic properties of the targets are also obtained, which unravel their core dynamics and profiles.

Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve resolutions equivalent to $6.55\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\times10^{-5}$ of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04803" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent observations of PKS 2155-304 with MAGIC and LST-1 in a multi-wavelength context</a><span class="id">[2510.04803]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>PKS 2155-304 is a well-known high-frequency peaked BL Lac (HBL) at redshift z=0.116, which has been extensively studied across the electromagnetic spectrum due to its rapid and large-amplitude variability.

The alternation of quiescent and enhanced states, observed with a tentative quasi-periodicity of 1.74 $\pm$ 0.13 years in high-energy (HE; 100 MeV &lt; E &lt; 100 GeV) $\gamma$-rays, makes this source a key target also for ground-based $\gamma$-ray instruments and in particular for the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes.

We present new JWST NIRSpec G395H phase-curve observations that probe its atmospheric composition in unprecedented detail. At near-infrared wavelengths, which penetrate the high-altitude clouds inferred from previous NIRISS/SOSS spectra, thermal emission reveals a carbon-rich atmosphere with opacity dominated by carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Both species are detected at all orbital phases, with retrieved mixing ratios of 10^-1 for CO and 10^-4 for CO2, indicating a globally well-mixed reservoir of carbon-bearing gases. We also moderately detect water vapor (H2O) and tentatively detect sulfur dioxide (SO2), providing insight into its chemistry and possible photochemical production under intense stellar irradiation. From these detections we infer a carbon-to-oxygen ratio near unity (C/O   1) and a metallicity exceeding 500X Solar, consistent with equilibrium chemistry predictions for high-temperature atmospheres. This enrichment raises the mean molecular weight, reducing atmospheric escape, and likely helps LTT-9779 b retain a substantial atmosphere despite extreme irradiation. Our findings show that LTT-9779 b survives where few planets can, maintaining a carbon-rich atmosphere in a region where hot Neptune-class worlds are expected to evaporate.

In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and 1/3 of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up  5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04949" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jet MHD analytical model - framework for radiative transfer</a><span class="id">[2510.04949]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We developed the full magnetohydrodynamical analytical jet model that allows accurate reproducing of a transversal and longitudinal structure for a highly collimated relativistic jets.

Among various candidates, the weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) scenario stands out and is under extensive study. The detection of the hypothetical gamma-ray emission from WIMP annihilation could act as a direct probe of electroweak-scale interactions, complementing DM collider searches and other direct DM detection techniques. At very high energies (VHE), WIMP self-annihilation is expected to produce gamma rays together with other Standard Model particles. The galactic center (GC), due to its relative proximity to the Earth and its high expected DM density, is a prime target for monoenergetic line searches. IACTs have placed strong constraints on the DM properties at the GC, with the MAGIC providing the most stringent limits from 20 TeV to 100 TeV, exploiting large zenith angle (LZA) observations. However, the limited field of view (FoV) of the MAGIC telescopes (&lt; 3.5° ) prevented a detailed study of the extended region around the GC in which an enhanced DM density is expected. The LST-1 of the CTAO, located at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory (La Palma, Spain), close to the MAGIC site, has been observing the GC since 2021. With its wide FoV of 4.5°, LST-1 could contribute significantly to the WIMPs search at the GC. The observations are performed at LZA (ZA &gt; 58°), which, while required due to the source's low altitude, also optimizes the detection of gamma rays up to 100 TeV and beyond.

However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Low-Amplitude Variability in First Overtone Cepheids with TESS</a><span class="id">[2510.05017]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Classical Cepheid stars that pulsate in the first overtone radial mode often exhibit additional periodicities at the millimagnitude level. Extensive studies of the OGLE data of the Magellanic Clouds have revealed distinct groups based on their period ratio with the first overtone mode. These groups are similar to those found in overtone RR Lyrae stars. Theoretical calculations suggest that some of the observed periodicities may be consistent with non-radial modes, while others remain unexplained. Currently, we only know of a handful of examples from the Galactic Cepheid sample that exhibit low-amplitude periodicities. The purpose of this study is to undertake a systematic search for low-amplitude variability in overtone Cepheids of the Milky Way in the photometric data of the full-frame images of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, which were produced with the MIT Quick Look Pipeline. We applied standard Fourier analysis and classified the additional signals according to their period ratio to the overtone pulsation period. We found 127 stars in total to exhibit additional periodicities. In 17 stars, these can be identified as a second radial overtone. A further 83 stars were observed to display periodic signals with a ratio of $P_{\mathrm{x}}/P_{1\mathrm{O}}$ in the range 0.60$-$0.65. In 15 stars, the $P_{1\mathrm{O}}/P_{\mathrm{x}}$ is found to be near $\sim$0.68, of which six are also found to be in the previous group. Furthermore, we observed the presence of low-amplitude signals in 22 stars outside the aforementioned period ratios. It is possible that some of these may be direct detections of non-radial modes, with no harmonic frequency peak in the 0.60$-$0.65 period range. The TESS measurements revealed that the amplitudes and frequencies of these signals often vary within a TESS sector, a phenomenon that challenges theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05030" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic topology.

In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \E{7}–\E{10}, \E{13}–\E{15}, and \E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05444" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining the $^{30}$P($p,γ)^{31}$S reaction rate in ONe novae via the weak, low-energy, $β$-delayed proton decay of $^{31}$Cl</a><span class="id">[2204.05444]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $^{30}$P$(p,\gamma)^{31}$S reaction plays an important role in understanding nucleosynthesis of $A\geq 30$ nuclides in oxygen-neon novae.

The intensity $I^{260}_{\beta p} = 8.3^{+1.2}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-6}$ represents the weakest $\beta$-delayed, charged-particle emission ever measured below 400 keV, resulting in a proton branching ratio of $\Gamma_p / \Gamma = 2.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-4}$. By combining this measurement with shell-model calculations for $\Gamma_{\gamma}$ and past work on other resonances, the total $^{30}$P$(p,\gamma)^{31}$S rate has been determined with reduced uncertainty.

Such an asymmetry can lead to the resonant production of $\mathrm{keV}$-scale sterile neutrinos, which are a fascinating candidate for dark matter. In this paper, we comprehensively revisit the resonant production processes with a refined numerical analysis, adopting a dynamical discretization of momentum modes to take care of the sharpness of the resonance. We find parameter regions consistent with X-ray and Lyman-$\alpha$ constraints for lepton-to-entropy ratio $\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ and $m_{\nu_s}\gtrsim 20$ keV. We also explore the Affleck-Dine mechanism as a possible origin for such asymmetries. While previous studies considered resonant production after lepton number generation, we numerically investigate cases where a fraction of sterile neutrinos is produced during lepton number injection. In this regime, some parameter sets can shorten the free-streaming length and reduce the required mixing angle to match the observed dark matter abundance, thereby mitigating the observational constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comprehensive \textsl{Ab Initio} Calculations of \ce{CO2-H2} and \ce{CO2-He} Collisional Properties</a><span class="id">[2510.03327]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present comprehensive \textsl{ab initio} calculations of CO$_{\rm 2}$-H$_{\rm 2}$ and CO$_{\rm 2}$-He collisional properties from first principles, employing CCSD(T), potential calculations together with close-coupling dynamical scattering in the \YUMI framework.

This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade.

A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter fields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</a><span class="id">[2510.04011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04063" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ordinal Encoding as a Regularizer in Binary Loss for Solar Flare Prediction</a><span class="id">[2510.04063]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare (NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function, we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04332" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biased parameter inference of eccentric, spin-precessing binary black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.04332]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While the majority of gravitational wave (GW) events observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors are consistent with mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) on quasi-circular orbits, some events are also consistent with non-zero orbital eccentricity, indicating that the binaries could have formed via dynamical interactions. Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for spin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of spins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH mergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and precessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of source parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular precessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as chirp mass and spin-precession ($\chi_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric BBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that for signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor calculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a quasi-circular precessing-spin model. Our study highlights the complex nature of GW signals from eccentric, precessing-spin binaries and the need for readily usable inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric, spin-precessing waveform models for unbiased parameter estimation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing black hole metrics with binary black hole inspirals</a><span class="id">[2510.04703]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gravitational wave astronomy has opened an unprecedented window onto tests of gravity and fundamental physics in the strong-field regime.

The method involves calculating the phase of gravitational waves using the effective one-body formalism and then applying the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework to constrain the parameters appearing in these scenarios beyond General Relativity. The effective one-body method, known for its capability to model complex gravitational waveforms, is used to compute the wave phase, and the post-Einsteinian framework allows for a flexible, model-independent approach to parameter estimation. We demonstrate that gravitational wave data provide evidence supporting the Kerr nature of black holes, showing no significant deviations from General Relativity, thereby affirming its validity within the current observational limits.

Here we report a three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulation of a merger between two hybrid Helium-Carbon-Oxygen white dwarfs (HeCO WDs with masses of 0.69 and 0.62 M$_\odot$). We find that the merger leads to a partial disruption of the secondary WD, coupled with a double-detonation explosion of the primary WD. This launches the remnant core of the secondary WD at a speed of $~2000$ km s$^{-1}$, consistent with observed HVWDs. The low mass of the ejected remnant and its heating from the primary WD's ejecta explain the observed luminosities and temperatures of hot HVWDs, which are otherwise difficult to reconcile with previous models (such as the D6). This discovery establishes a new formation channel for HVWDs and points to a previously unrecognized pathway for producing peculiar Type Ia supernovae and faint explosive transients.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmology from UNIONS weak lensing profiles of galaxy clusters</a><span class="id">[2501.09147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmological information is encoded in the structure of galaxy clusters.

The infall region is largely insensitive to baryonic physics, and provides a cleaner structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectroscopic Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Using a preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess surface mass density profiles for each sample. We then compare the mean profile for the DESI Legacy sample, which is the most complete, to predictions from a suite of simulations covering a range of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$, obtaining constraints of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.34\pm 0.06$ and $\sigma_8=0.77 \pm 0.04$.

The atmospheric composition is estimated with the updated BeAR retrieval code across a grid of retrieval setups and spectral resolutions. Our transit spectrum is consistent with previous studies, except at the red end of the NIRISS data. Our retrievals support a higher mean molecular weight atmosphere for TOI-270 d. We provide refined abundance constraints and find statistically favored model extensions indicating either sulfur-rich chemistry with species such as CS2, CS, and H2CS, or the possible presence of CH3Cl or CH3F. However, Bayesian inference cannot distinguish between these scenarios due to similar opacities below 4 microns. Our analysis reinforces TOI-270 d as a highly interesting warm sub-Neptune for atmospheric studies, with a complex chemistry in a cloud-free upper atmosphere.

However, the equality of $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ is typically broken in alternative theories of gravity. Observational constraints on the slip parameter are therefore of direct interest for testing Einstein's theory.

This is the final ingredient required for a complete parameterization of dust and dark energy-dominated cosmologies within the framework of Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology (PPNC), which allows for the fully self-consistent modelling of cosmological observables without assuming any specific theory of gravity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the Interior Structure and Mode of Tidal Heating in Enceladus</a><span class="id">[2505.14743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Enceladus is among the most intriguing bodies in the solar system due to its astrobiological potential. Determining the extent and duration of habitability (i.e., sustained habitability) requires characterizing the interior properties and the level and distribution of tidal heating in Enceladus. Inferring the intensity of geophysical activity in the core has direct implications for the potential hydrothermal activity and supply of chemical species important for habitability to the ocean. We build a statistical framework to constrain the interior using estimates of libration, shape, heat flux, gravity, and total mass. We use this framework to examine the extent that geodetic measurements can improve our understanding of the interior structure, with an emphasis on partitioning of dissipation between the shell and the core. We quantify plausible ranges of gravitational (k2) and displacement (h2, l2) tidal Love numbers consistent with existing observations. We demonstrate that measuring k2 alone can only constrain the total tidally dissipated energy, but not its radial distribution. However, measuring the amplitude and phase of h2 or l2 facilitates determining the extent of tidal dissipation in the shell and the core. We provide the precisions required for measuring k2, h2, and l2 that enable distinguishing between the main tidal heating scenarios, i.e., in the shell versus the core. We also explore the effect of the structural heterogeneities of the shell on the tidal response. Lastly, we evaluate the efficacy of future geodetic measurements to constrain key interior properties essential to understand the present-day (instantaneous) and long-term (sustained) habitability at Enceladus.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00947" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Differentiation, the exception not the rule – Evidence for full miscibility in sub-Neptune interiors</a><span class="id">[2507.00947]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the consequences of non-ideal mixing between silicate, iron metal, and hydrogen for the structures of the cores of sub-Neptunes with implications for super-Earths, warm Neptunes, and ice giants.

We show that their multipoles with respect to the line of sight can be accurately described by a tree-level perturbation theory model on large scales ($k\lesssim 0.11\,h$/Mpc) at $z=0$. For these scales and in a simulation volume of 1 Gpc/$h$, we detect the bispectrum monopole $B_{\delta\delta E}^{00}$ at $\sim 30\sigma$ and the two quadrupoles $B_{\delta \delta E}^{11}$ and $B_{\delta \delta E}^{20}$ at $\sim 25\sigma$ and $\sim 15\sigma$, respectively. We also report similar detection significances for the lowest order multipoles of $B_{\delta EE}$ and $B_{EEE}$, although these are largely driven by stochastic contributions. We show that the first and second order EFT parameters are consistent with those obtained from fitting the IA power spectrum analysis at next-to-leading order, without requiring any priors to break degeneracies for the quadratic bias parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of higher multipole moments of $B_{\delta\delta E}$ greatly reduces the errors on second order bias parameters, by factors of 5 or more. The IA bispectrum thus provides an effective means of determining higher order shape bias parameters, thereby characterizing the scale dependence of the IA signal. We also detect parity-odd bispectra such as $B_{\delta \delta B}$ and $B_{\delta EB}$ at $\sim 10 \sigma$ significance or more for $k&lt;0.15\,h$/Mpc and they are fully consistent with the parity-even sector. Furthermore, we check that the Gaussian covariance approximation works reasonably well on the scales we consider here. These results lay the groundwork for using the bispectrum of IA in cosmological analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of 2D and 3D BAO measurements on the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation with HII galaxies</a><span class="id">[2507.17113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR) is a fundamental and practical condition in observational cosmology that connects the luminosity distance and angular diameter distance. Testing its validity offers a powerful tool to probe new physics beyond the standard cosmological model. In this work, for the first time, we present a novel consistency test of CDDR by combining HII galaxy data with a comprehensive set of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) measurements. The BAO measurements include two-dimensional (2D) BAO and three-dimensional (3D) BAO from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), as well as the latest 3D BAO data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). We adopt four different parameterizations of the distance duality relation parameter, $\eta(z)$, to investigate possible deviations and their evolution with cosmic time. To ensure accurate redshift matching across datasets, we reconstruct the distance measures through a model-independent Artificial Neural Network (ANN) approach. {We find no significant deviation from the CDDR (less than 68% confidence level) among four parameterizations. Furthermore, our results show that the constraints on $\eta(z)$ obtained separately from 2D and 3D BAO measurements are consistent at the 68% confidence level. This indicates that there is no significant tension between the two datasets under the four parameterizations considered. Our ANN reconstruction of HII galaxies could provide constraints on the CDDR at redshifts beyond the reach of Type Ia supernovae.} Finally, the consistency of our results supports the standard CDDR and demonstrates the robustness of our analytical approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07961" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747</a><span class="id">[2508.07961]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks.

Recent observations by the X-ray polarimeter IXPE support the presence of turbulence, with varying conditions even in different regions of a same source. We model such emission, and in particular the degree of linear polarization, by using 3D relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations for the first time. Thanks to a novel accelerated version of the ECHO code, a series of 3D relativistic MHD simulations were performed assuming a relativistically hot plasma and various degrees of magnetization, mimicking different conditions encountered in synchrotron sources. Magnetic fluctuations at random directions with respect to a background field were initialized at large scales. After the full development of the turbulent cascade, the statistical properties of the plasma and of the synchrotron emission maps were analyzed. Turbulence rapidly relaxes to a sort of Alfvénic equilibrium and a Kolmogorov cascade with a slope of $-5/3$ soon develops, with differences depending on the initial ratio, $\eta$, of magnetic fluctuations over the background field. Dissipation mostly occurs in thin current sheets, where (numerical) reconnection takes place and intermittency and deviation from isotropic Gaussian distributions are observed. Synthetic synchrotron maps and their statistical properties depend on $\eta$ too, approaching analytical estimates for large $\eta$. The integrated degree of linear polarization is found to cover the whole range of observed values in PWNe, and its dependence on the relative amplitude of turbulent fluctuations shows a good agreement with analytical estimates, even in the presence of anisotropy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating dark matter admixed in neutron stars with simultaneous mass-radius constraints</a><span class="id">[2509.07767]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate how simultaneous mass and radius measurements of massive neutron stars (NSs) can help constrain properties of dark matter (DM) possibly admixed in them.

Thus, in this work, the foundation of spatially homogeneous yet anisotropic universes is studied. Specifically, when given a 3D Lie algebra of \emph{desired} Killing vector fields (as would be the case for a homogeneous yet anisotropic universe), we provide an explicit construction for the metric that has exactly those as its Killing vector fields. This construction is presented accessibly, in a directly-usable, algorithmic fashion.

Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e &lt; 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p &lt; 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09882" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization</a><span class="id">[2506.09882]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-messenger FIMP</a><span class="id">[2506.13860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a multi-messenger frontier probe of non-thermal or freeze-in massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) by considering an effective field theory (EFT) setup.

We improve the extended linear sigma model with baryons, proposed in our previous work, by introducing the flavor structures constructed from antisymmetric tensors of chiral representations to study these physics. The parameter space of this model is refined with well-reproduced nuclear matter properties at saturation density by the lowest order Lagrangian, ensuring consistency with vacuum results, such as $f_\pi \approx 134 \, \text{MeV}$. The anticipated plateau-like behaviors of the symmetry energy are predicted at intermediate densities, which is crucial for the consistency of GW170817 and the neutron skin thickness of $\text{Pb}^{208}$. Subsequently, neutron star structures are calculated using several parameter sets, and the results for the nuclear matter properties at saturation density align with empirical values. It is found that the neutron star structures are sensitive to the couplings between the iso-vector $a_0$ meson and nucleons and the four-vector meson couplings: small values of both are favorable. Meanwhile, nuclear matter properties at saturation density favor larger values of the latter and are not sensitive to the former. This signifies the statistical significance of neutron star observations when obtaining realistic chiral effective field theories or models at various densities. The parameter set favored by neutron star observations also aligns the behavior of the sound velocity with the conformal limit at high densities relevant to cores of massive stars.

This region is exclusively probed by the future tonne-scale $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments, providing a unique window to test the mLRSM and the possible origin of neutrino masses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01060" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?</a><span class="id">[2510.01060]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers $10^3 \le S \le 2 \times 10^5$. Although the tearing-mode instability is commonly thought to trigger a plasmoid cascade that enables fast reconnection - i.e., independent of $S$ - our results, in broad agreement with the recent findings of Morillo &amp; Alexakis (2025), challenge this belief. We demonstrate a Sweet-Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values, plasmoid formation sets in leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity dependent, and therefore slow. In our simulations, the plasmoids do not form a cascade of mergers, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Our findings call for the revision of the role of plasmoid formation in 2D high Lundquist number magnetic reconnection. Even if future studies demonstrate that 2D plasmoid-reconnection becomes resistivity-independent at sufficiently large $S$, directly extending those results to 3D astrophysical environments is not justified, as in realistic circumstances, the increase of $S$ also raises the Reynolds number of the outflows, making it essential to account for the dominant role of turbulence.</p></div></details></article></body>
