The polarization levels seen throughout our observations are on average 0.87% +/- 0.05% higher than those of any Type Ib SN yet studied, suggesting either that it is the most asymmetric of the sample, or if all SNe Ib have similar asymmetry, that it is viewed at a more optimum angle. Significant continuum polarization indicates that the photosphere exhibited a global departure from spherical symmetry at the level of 10%-40% at the earliest times (days 0–40), which decreased to 0%-20% by days 57–90. During the early photospheric phase, the ejecta maintained a near-constant orientation of 12°-20° on the sky, as shown by the dominant axis in the Stokes q-u plane. Polarization signatures in the Fe II {\lambda}{\lambda}{\lambda}4924, 5018, 5169 lines shared this axis. Meanwhile, high levels of polarization associated with the He I lines traced distinct q-u loops with a dramatic rotation away from the dominant axis, indicating that the early-time ejecta were also characterized by hot, fast, helium-rich material concentrated near the poles. At day 295, during the transition to the nebular phase, a new, highly elongated structure became prominent in the ejecta, with an axis orthogonal to the dominant axis that defined the photospheric phase. This dual-axis geometry may link SN 2012au's high luminosity and asymmetric structure to a magnetar powering mechanism.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Analytical Model for the Eccentricity Cascade: Hot Jupiter Formation via S-type Instability</a><span class="id">[2511.10726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A widely explored pathway for hot Jupiter (HJ) formation is high-eccentricity migration driven by von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles induced by an exterior companion. However, for a distant or low-mass companion, this mechanism typically demands that the planet's initial orbit be very nearly perpendicular to that of the companion. In previous work (Yang et al. 2025), we demonstrated that such fine-tuning can be circumvented in the HAT-P-7 system due to the presence of an intermediate body that efficiently couples the orbits of the planet and the distant companion – a mechanism we termed the eccentricity cascade (EC). In this work, we analytically characterize the dynamics governing the EC and delineate the parameter space within which it effectively operates. Our qualitative results are as follows: (i) The proto-HJ's eccentricity is most efficiently excited when the inner triple is on the verge of dynamical instability, (ii) the addition of a distant fourth body allows this instability to be approached gradually, and (iii) the instability mechanism is closely related to the stability of circumstellar (S-type) planets in binaries. By deriving an analytic criterion for S-type instability, we obtain closed-form expressions describing the onset of the EC. Our results show that efficient HJ formation via the EC occurs across a broad range of intermediate perturbers, highlighting its potential as a robust migration channel.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10728" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Widening of Binaries via Non-conservative Mass Transfer as a Formation Channel for Gaia Black Hole System</a><span class="id">[2511.10728]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The detected Gaia systems hosting compact objects challenge standard models of binary star evolution. In particular, if the observed black hole (BH) systems evolved in isolation, it is expected that they underwent a mass transfer phase. Given their highly unequal mass ratios, such mass transfer is dynamically unstable within standard models, leading to either a stellar merger or a final binary with a very short orbital period. In contrast, the observed systems have much wider orbits than predicted, making their formation within conventional evolutionary frameworks difficult to reconcile. With the aid of detailed binary evolution calculations, we test whether fully non-conservative mass transfer, where mass is lost from the system carrying the specific angular momentum of the donor's center of mass, can explain the properties of two of the Gaia BH systems. This mass-loss geometry differs from the standard isotropic re-emission model, which assumes mass loss from the accretor's vicinity. We find that our mass-loss model, without the need for fine-tuning, reproduces the observed orbital periods of the two Gaia BH systems remarkably well across a wide range of initial conditions. This scenario, therefore, offers a plausible formation pathway for these systems. We speculate that orbital widening during mass loss could result from the unequal Roche-lobe sizes of the components and eruptive mass loss driven by the donor's high-opacity subsurface layers. Similar mass loss may also be relevant for all other classes of post-mass-transfer binaries that face analogous evolutionary challenges, including Gaia neutron star and white dwarf systems, binaries hosting stripped-envelope Wolf-Rayet stars, and low-mass X-ray binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TESS Investigation – Demographics of Young Exoplanets (TI-DYE) IV: a Jovian radius planet orbiting a 34 Myr Sun-like star in the Vela association</a><span class="id">[2511.10734]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The discovery of infant (&lt; 50 Myr), close-in (&lt;30-day period) planets is vital in understanding the formation mechanisms that lead to the distribution of mature transiting planets as discovered by Kepler. Despite several discoveries in this age bin, the sample is still too small for a robust statistical comparison to older planets. Here we report the validation of TOI-6448 b, an 8.8 +/- 0.8 Re planet on a 14.8 day orbit. TOI-6448 was previously identified to be a likely member of Vela Population IV. We confirm the star's membership and re-derive the age of the cluster using isochrones, variability, and gyrochronology. We find the star, and thus planet, to be 34 +/- 3 Myr. Like other young planets, TOI-6448 b lands in a region of parameter space with few older planets. While just one data point, this fits with prior findings of an excess of 5-11Re planets around young stars far beyond what can be explained by reduced sensitivity at young ages. Our ongoing search of Vela, Taurus-Auriga, Sco-Cen, and Orion are expected to reveal dozens more &lt; 50 Myr transiting planets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10736" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intra-night optical polarization monitoring of blazars</a><span class="id">[2511.10736]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Blazars are known for their extreme variability across the electromagnetic spectrum. Variability at very short timescales can push the boundaries between competing models offering us much needed discriminating power. This is particularly true for polarization variability that allows us to probe particle acceleration and high-energy emission models in blazars. Here we present results from the first pilot study of intra-night optical polarization monitoring conducted using RoboPol at the Skinakas Observatory and supplemented by observations from the Calar Alto, Perkins, and Sierra Nevada observatories. Our results show that while variability patterns can widely vary between sources, variability on timescales as short as minutes is prevalent in blazar jets. The amplitude of variations are typically small, a few percent for the polarization degree and less than 20 degrees for the polarization angle, pointing to a significant contribution to the optical emission from a turbulent magnetic field component, while the overall stability of the polarization angle over time points to a preferred magnetic field orientation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KOALA, a new ATLAS9 database – I. Model atmospheres, opacities, fluxes, bolometric corrections, magnitudes and colours</a><span class="id">[2511.10737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the KOALA database, a new set of LTE, line-blanketed model atmospheres calculated with the code ATLAS9, together with the corresponding Opacity Distribution Functions and emergent fluxes. The latter were used also to calculated G-band bolometric corrections and theoretical magnitudes and colours for several photometric systems, i.e. UBVRI, 2MASS, Hypparcos-Tycho, SDSS, Galex, Euclid and Gaia DR3. With respect to the previous grids of ATLAS9 model atmospheres, we adopted the solar mixture by Caffau/Lodders and we extend the sampling in metallicity (from -5.0 to -2.5 dex with step of 0.5 dex, and from -2.5 dex to +0.5 dex with step of 0.25 dex) and in [alfa/Fe] (from -0.4 to +0.4 dex with a step of 0.2 dex). Also, we provide a finer sampling in Teff for Teff lower than 7000 K. This finer grid allows for more accurate interpolation of colours and in many cases it makes not necessary to compute a new model atmosphere, since one of the grid can be used directly. A total of 51663 model atmospheres and emergent fluxes have been computed. Finally, we discuss the impact of [M/H] and [alfa/Fe] on the thermal and pressure structures of the model atmospheres and on theoretical colours.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10739" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hybrid Simulations of Supersonic Shear Flows: I) Particle Acceleration</a><span class="id">[2511.10739]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Supersonic flows are ubiquitous in warm and cool media; their dissipation leads to heating, generation of nonthermal particles, and amplification of background magnetic fields. We present 2D hybrid (kinetic ions - fluid electrons) simulations of decaying shear flows across the subsonic-to-supersonic transition, finding that the canonical Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in subsonic cases gives way to the formation of shocklets in supersonic shears, where dissipation is faster and nonthermal particles are produced. We discuss the dependence on the flow Mach number of particle acceleration, the viscosity induced by kinetic effects, and the production of magnetic turbulence. We outline the potential impact of these findings for turbulence in the warm interstellar medium, for molecular clouds, and for accretion disks, leaving to a companion paper the discussion of the effects on the shear of self-generated and pre-existing energetic particles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10747" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrogen-Poor Superluminous Supernovae in the Nebular Phase: Spectral Diversity Due to Ejecta Ionization as a Probe of the Power Source</a><span class="id">[2511.10747]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a large sample of 39 nebular-phase optical spectra of 25 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) and jointly analyze them with previously published spectra of 12 events. We measure the properties of key emission features, namely those at 6300, 7300, and 7774 angstroms (associated with [O I], [Ca II]/[O II], and O I, respectively), and find that SLSNe exhibit much wider spectral diversity than normal SNe Ic, primarily in the line ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, which is highly sensitive to ejecta ionization. Some events exhibit weak [O I] and a clear [O II] contribution to the 7300 angstrom feature, enhancing the ratio, along with [O III] lines at 4363 and 5007 angstroms. Other SLSNe show weak or no lines of ionized oxygen. Moreover, we find that the population exhibits decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ over time, while a few outliers instead display sustained high or increasing ratios for extended periods. The ratio $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ is also correlated with the rise and decline times of the light curves, with slower events exhibiting higher ionization, the first robust connection between early light curve and late-time spectral properties, likely due to the magnetar's impact: slower-evolving SLSNe are generally powered by engines with longer spin-down timescales, which deposit more energy at later phases. Among the events with decreasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$, SLSNe with high ionization are on average powered by magnetars with higher thermalized spin-down power, a correlation that is most significant for events with $M_{\rm ej}\lesssim12$ M$_{\odot}$. The ionization in the outliers with increasing $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ may be due to late CSM interaction. $L_{7300}/L_{6300}$ and its evolution are therefore key diagnostics of SLSN engines and progenitor mass loss.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hydrogen-line profiles from accreting gas giants and their CPDs</a><span class="id">[2511.10751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Few gas giants have been observed in their accretion phase. ELT instruments will have a higher sensitivity and a smaller inner working angle than instruments up to now, allowing detailed characterisation. We study the observability of accreting gas giants with METIS, the first-generation ELT spectrograph with a resolution R = 1e5. We focus on the accretion-tracing hydrogen recombination lines accessible to METIS, mainly Brackett alpha and Pfund-series lines. Our approach is general but we take PDS 70 b as a fiducial case. To calculate high-resolution line profiles, we combine a semianalytical multidimensional description of the flow onto an accreting planet and its circumplanetary disc (CPD) with local NLTE shock-emission calculations. We assume the limiting scenario of no extinction, appropriate for gas giants in gaps, and negligible contribution from magnetospheric accretion. We use resolved photospheric models, and include detector sensitivities to compute required observing times. Both the planet surface and the CPD surface shocks contribute to the total line profile, which is non-Gaussian and much narrower than the free-fall velocity. When the accretion onto PDS 70 b is at its maximum observed strength, the Br a line peak is equal to the photospheric continuum, which is modulated mostly by water features. However, the rotation of the planet broadens the features, making the shock excess stand out. At Br a, already only the continuum of PDS 70 b should yield SNR = 12 in 4 h, and for the fiducial accretion rate, the line peak will have a per-bin SNR = 28 in 4 h. The peak excess should require only about 10 min to reach SNR = 3. Br a is a potent planet formation tracer accessible to ELT/METIS in little integration time. Resolved line profiles will place independent constraints especially on the mass and radius of accreting planets, and help identify the accretion mechanism(s) at work.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10765" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeans Model for the Shapes of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</a><span class="id">[2511.10765]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Jeans model is a semi-analytical approach to modeling self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) that works remarkably well to reproduce the spherically-averaged halo profiles from observations and simulations of relaxed galaxies and galaxy clusters. However, SIDM halos are not spherically symmetric in general since they respond to nonspherical baryon distributions and retain nonsphericity from their initial collapse. In this work, we generalize the Jeans model to describe SIDM density profiles and halo shapes beyond spherical symmetry. Observational tests via halo shapes are especially important for testing SIDM in massive galaxies, $M_{\rm 200} \sim 10^{12} - 10^{13} \; \Msun$, where SIDM and collisionless dark matter halos can have indistinguishable spherically-averaged profiles but distinct halo shapes. We validate our model by comparing to cosmological simulations with baryons for both SIDM with $\sigmam = 1 \cmg$ and collisionless cold dark matter. Our approach differs from previous work in this direction, taking into account the fact that multiple scatterings are required to impact the shape of the halo, as well as being computationally inexpensive to implement. The nonspherical Jeans model can be used in conjunction with halo shape observations (e.g., from gravitational lensing or X-ray data) to directly constrain dark matter self-interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10801" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What's Inside Matters: The Effect of Oxygen Fugacity and Initial Volatile Abundance on the Atmospheres of the TRAPPIST-1 Planets</a><span class="id">[2511.10801]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The TRAPPIST-1 planets have become prime targets for studying the atmospheric and geophysical properties of planets around M-dwarf stars. To effectively identify their atmospheric composition, we first must understand their geological evolution. For this study, we focus on enhancing an existing atmosphere-interior exchange model by incorporating additional geological processes relevant to rocky planets. We have extended the model to include the carbon cycle, which enables the model to track four key gas species - CO$_2$, CO, H$_2$O, and H$_2$ - across four planetary reservoirs: the mantle, plate, ocean, and atmosphere. Major features added include surface temperature calculations which are crucial for the carbon cycle, oxygen fugacity as a planetary interior parameter in the model, and oxidation reactions and diffusion-limited escape calculations to the atmosphere portion of the model. We successfully validated the model for Earth and applied this model to study the effect of oxygen fugacity and initial water abundance on TRAPPIST-1 d, e and f. Our results for present-day abundances show that oxygen fugacity significantly affects the partial pressures of H$_2$ and CO$_2$ for all three planets with minor effects for CO on two of the planets. We also found that H$_2$ is strongly dependent on water mass fraction (WMF). The addition of atmospheric processes produced a significant difference in the H$_2$ and CO abundances at present-day. These results highlight the importance of considering interior parameters to be able to further constrain the geological evolution of these planets and effectively put atmosphere observations into context.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10880" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubiquitous high-frequency waves and disturbances in the active region corona observed with DKIST/Cryo-NIRSP</a><span class="id">[2511.10880]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The plasma of the solar corona harbors a multitude of coronal wave modes, some of which could be dissipated to provide the required energy and momentum to heat the corona and accelerate the solar wind. We present observations of the corona acquired with the newly commissioned infrared slit spectropolarimeter Cryo-NIRSP at the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), Haleakala, Hawaii to study the high frequency wave behavior in closed, active-region structures. Cryo-NIRSP observes the corona off the limb in the Fe XIII 1074 and 1079 nm forbidden atomic lines. The large aperture of DKIST allows us to explore the active region corona with temporal resolution faster than a second with an achieved spatial resolution of 2-5 arcseconds. Enhanced wave power is observed in the power spectra up to 100 mHz. Furthermore, we report on a statistically significant anti-correlation between the Fe XIII 1074 nm peak line intensity and line width in our data, possibly pointing to the presence of compressive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes. These observations show how the powerful spectropolarimetric capabilities of DKIST offer great promise for furthering our knowledge of coronal MHD waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In situ Evidence of 5-minute Oscillations from Parker Solar Probe</a><span class="id">[2511.10906]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Sun's surface vibrates in characteristic 5-minute oscillations, known as p-modes, generated by sound waves trapped within the convection zone. Although these oscillations have long been hypothesized to reach into the solar wind, direct in situ evidence has remained elusive, even during previous close encounters by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). Here, we present the first promising in situ detection of 5-minute oscillations in the upper solar corona, based on observations from PSP's three closest perihelia. In two events at 9.9 solar radii, we identify statistically significant ($\sim$ 6 $\sigma$) 3.1-3.2 mHz peaks in the magnetic field power spectrum, each appearing as a large-amplitude, spherically polarized Alfvénic wave train lasting approximately 35 minutes. These results demonstrate that global solar oscillations can reach and potentially influence the solar wind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A High-Precision Dynamical Model of Callisto: Incorporating Rotation Effects within Multi-Layer Internal Structure Models</a><span class="id">[2511.10929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>China is planing to launch the Tianwen-4 mission around the year 2030, with its aim being the exploration of Jupiter and its moon, Callisto. Within the realm of deep space exploration, the accuracy of ephemerides is of great importance. Current ephemerides employ a simplified rotation model for Callisto, which this study addresses by proposing a novel dynamical model. This model enhancesthe existing orbital dynamics by integrating Callisto's rotational motions influenced by gravitational torques from the Sun, Jupiter, and other Galilean moons within an inertial frame, capturing the intricate coupling between Callisto's orbital and rotational dynamics. The study establishes a full dynamical model by deriving analytical expressions for this coupling and developing an adjustment model for data fitting using precise orbit determination methods. Furthermore, the influence of tidal effects on Callisto's motion is investigated, considering its multi-layered internal structure. Results demonstrate that the difference between the newly established full model and the model in current ephemerides is on the order of tens of meters. When calculating the impact of different internal structures of Callisto on its orbit, the influence of three-layered and two-layered structures is on the order of meters, suggesting that the development of a high-precision dynamical model requires additional constraints on the internal structure of Callisto. This research provides a novel alternative for a new generation of precise numerical ephemerides for Callisto. Additionally, these findings provide a testing platform for the data from the Tianwen-4 mission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EUSO-SPB2 Cherenkov Telescope: Overview and First Neutrino Constraints</a><span class="id">[2511.10944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Earth-skimming tau neutrinos with energies above $\sim 10$ PeV can convert to tau leptons that decay in the atmosphere and initiate upward-going extensive air showers that generate optical Cherenkov signals.

To tackle this issue, we propose a generic relation of mapping the observed matter clustering to its counterpart in a dark-matter-only universe. We verify this relation to be accurate at better than $1\%$ level at $k&lt;1\,h/$Mpc and $z\in [0,3]$ in both TNG and Illustris simulations, demonstrating its model-independence to the underlying baryonic physics. Implementing this relation in observations will be made possible by the specifically designed cross-correlation statistics and baryon census (ionized diffuse gas through localized fast radio bursts, stellar mass through galaxy surveys, and neutral hydrogen through 21cm mapping). It is capable of correcting the baryonic effect not only in the matter power spectrum, but also at the field level, as demonstrated by tests on the scattering transform statistics. This approach paves the way for constructing the dark-matter-only counterpart of the observed Universe, establishing an ideal cosmological laboratory for probing the dark universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accuracy and Applicability of the Hartle-Thorne and Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu Methods for Modeling Rotating Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2511.10996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutron stars, which are composed of extremely dense nuclear matter, serve as natural laboratories to study nuclear interactions beyond the terrestrial experiments. Recent researches have actively explored how the equation of state (EoS) can be constrained by observed neutron star masses and radii, and how nuclear interactions affect their macroscopic properties. Most of these studies, however, rely on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, which assumed static, spherically symmetric neutron stars. Since neutron stars are rotating objects and thus axisymmetrically deformed, the TOV calculation may be insufficient to capture their realistic structure. In this work, we investigate the influence of nuclear matter properties on the physical quantities of rotating neutron stars using two approaches: the perturbative Hartle-Thorne (HT) method and fully general relativistic Komatsu-Eriguchi-Hachisu (KEH) method. For nuclear EoS parameter sets, we emamine the OMEG series, in which the slope of the symmetry energy $L$ is systematically varied. We find that rotational effects lead to a noticeable increase in the stellar radius, which depends sensitively on values of $L$. Additionally, focusing on the rotational deformation, we show that the results obtained by these two methods deviate each other even for the slowly rotating case such as $\Omega=200$ Hz. These results reveal that, for detailed discussions on the internal structure and stability of rotating neutron stars, the fully general relativistic method such as KEH is indispensable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11075" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Highly Polarized Intrinsic Emission and its Orthogonal Counterpart in Vela X-1</a><span class="id">[2511.11075]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Vela X-1 is one of the most archetypal wind-fed X-ray pulsars (XRPs), and the emergence of its orthogonal polarization states reveals distinctive polarimetric properties. Using data from Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observations of Vela X-1, we perform a polarization analysis of Vela X-1 using a triple power-law spectral model absorbed by varying column densities, successfully isolating two physically distinct orthogonal polarized components. The first polarized component corresponds to emission from the accretion mound surface that is not obscured by the wind clumps, with its polarization degree (PD) exceeding 30\%. In specific phase intervals, the PD reaches \(50.9 \pm 10.7\%\). This marks the first detection of such highly polarized neutron star emission in an XRP. The second polarized component likely originates from complex physical processes within or near the accretion mound, with its PD showing a potential negative correlation with column density. Furthermore, by rotating the predicted polarization angle (PA) of the first polarized component by 90$^\circ$, we successfully achieve separate fitting and simultaneous fitting of the two orthogonal polarization states using the rotating vector model (RVM).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galactic foreground residual biases in CMB lensing convergence reconstruction and delensing of B-mode maps</a><span class="id">[2511.11147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Diffused contamination from Galactic foreground emission is one of the main concern for reconstruction of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing potential for next-generation of CMB polarisation experiments. Using realistic simulations we investigate the impact of Galactic foreground residuals from multi-frequency foreground cleaning method on the lensing reconstruction, delensing CMB B-mode maps and constraints of the tensor-to-scalar ratio for CMB-S4-like experiment. We pay special attention to studies of the errors coming from small angular scale non-Gaussianity of the foreground residuals. We show that component separation is essential for the lensing reconstruction reducing Galactic emission contribution to the lensing reconstruction errors by one order of magnitude. The residual foreground contribution is dominated by terms coming from Gaussian components of the residual maps. Errors coming from non-Gaussian components are around three orders of magnitude smaller than the Gaussian one even for recent and the most complex models of the Galactic emission considered in this work. Although the bias in the reconstruction errors due to Gaussian component of the residuals is small, it is comparable to the cosmic variance limit for the lensing power spectrum. For this reason we correct for this bias in delensing of B-mode maps and constraining the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We show also that for the delensed B-mode maps with a simple quadratic estimator, residuals of the Galactic emission after component separation, errors are two orders of magnitude smaller than uncertainties from leftover of the lensing signal. However, for high-sensitivity CMB experiments and more efficient delensing algorithms that remove up to 90% of the lensing signal, the foreground residuals will become one of the main sources of errors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11179" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the canonical single-field slow-roll inflation model from observations</a><span class="id">[2511.11179]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we use two methods to constrain the the canonical single-field slow-roll inflation model. The first method exploits the analytic slow-roll-parameter dependence of primordial perturbations, and the second consists of a phenomenological parameterization of the primordial spectra of both scalar and tensor perturbations. We constrain the slow-roll parameters directly by adopting the latest datasets, including Planck satellite data, BICEP2/Keck data and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data. An advantage of this method is that we can work out the predictions of single-field slow-roll inflation model by using these constrained slow-roll parameters. We illustrate the predictions of the parameters characterizing the scalar power spectrum and constrain some inflation models. We find that the inflation model with monomial potential is disfavored, and the inflation models with a concave potential, such as the Starobinsky inflation model, brane inflation model are preferred. From the constraints on the slow-roll parameters, the derived tensor spectral index in the single-field slow-roll inflation model is quite small, namely $|n_t|\lesssim 4.7\times 10^{-3}$ which will be very difficult to be measured by CMB data only in the future, and the absolute value of derived running of tensor spectral index is not larger than $1.56\times 10^{-4}$ at $95\%$ confidence level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Empirical prediction of plasma emission measure distributions and X-EUV spectra of late-type stars</a><span class="id">[2511.11220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy emission spectra from the outer atmospheres of late-type stars represent an important feature of the stellar activity in several contexts, such as the photoevaporation and photochemistry of planetary atmospheres or the modeling of irradiated circumstellar disks in young objects. An accurate determination of these spectra in the EUV and soft X-ray (XUV) band requires high-resolution spectroscopy, that is rarely feasible with current instrumentation. We employed a relatively large set of plasma emission measure distributions (EMDs) as a function of temperature, derived from FUV and X-ray emission line spectra acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and Chandra or XMM-Newton, in order to devise a relatively simple recipe for predicting EMDs and XUV spectra of stars of different spectral types, activity levels, and plasma metallicity. We show that the EMDs in the range of temperatures between 10^4 K and 10^7.5 K can be described using the stellar surface X-ray flux as a control parameter, but this parameterization also depends on the spectral type. In particular, we find that M-type stars show slightly lower emission measure at temperatures below  10^5 K and higher emission measures for T &gt;  10^6.5 K with respect to FGK stars with similar surface X-ray fluxes. We evaluated the uncertainties in the broad-band EUV and X-ray fluxes derived from synthetic EMDs and spectra, considering in the error budget also the limited knowledge of the chemical abundances in stellar outer atmospheres.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11247" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence for the Keplerian orbit of a close companion around a giant star</a><span class="id">[2511.11247]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Close companions influence stellar evolution through tidal interactions, mass transfer, and mass loss effects. While such companions are detected around young stellar objects, main-sequence stars, red giants, and compact objects, direct observational evidence of close-in companions around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars has remained elusive. Here, we present (sub)millimeter time-domain imaging spectroscopy revealing the Keplerian motion of a close-in companion around the AGB star pi1 Gruis. The companion, slightly more massive than the AGB star, is likely a main-sequence star. Unlike more evolved stars with companions at comparable distances, pi1 Gru's companion follows a circular orbit, suggesting an eccentricity-generating mechanism late- or post-AGB. Our analysis suggests that model-predicted circularization rates may be underestimated. Our results highlight the potential of multi-epoch (sub)millimeter interferometry in detecting the Keplerian motion of close companions to giant stars and open avenues for our understanding of tidal interaction physics and binary evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11328" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation and disruption of resonant chains of super-Earths: Secular perturbations from outer eccentric embryos</a><span class="id">[2511.11328]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations have revealed the distribution of orbital period ratios of adjacent planets in multiple super-Earth systems and how these distributions change with time. The aim of this study is to clarify under what conditions the observed features of orbital period ratios of super-Earths can be explained, and to identify what causes the dynamical instability of super-Earths captured into resonant chains. We perform N-body simulations for 100 Myr that follow the formation and orbital evolution of super-Earths originating from a ring of planetary embryos at 1 au from the star. The simulations show that super-Earths undergo inward migration in the disk and are captured into mean-motion resonances with their neighbors. As a result, several resonant pairs form a resonant chain. After disk dispersal, some of these chains become dynamically unstable. In such cases, the final distribution of orbital period ratios and their time evolution can be consistent with recent observations. The instabilities of resonant chains are likely triggered by secular perturbations from embryos that remain on outer orbits beyond 1 au, indicating that not only giant planets but also small embryos can disrupt the resonances among inner super-Earths. We therefore further investigate the secular perturbations from outer embryos using analytic formulas and additional orbital calculations. We discuss the conditions required to excite the eccentricities of inner super-Earths on a timescale of about 100 Myr. These conditions include the need for large eccentricities of the outer embryos, as well as constraints on their masses and semimajor axes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Close-in compact super-Earth systems emerging from resonant chains: slow destabilization by unseen remnants of formation</a><span class="id">[2511.11329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planet formation simulations consistently predict compact systems of numerous small planets in chains of mean motion resonances formed by planet-disk interaction, but transiting planet surveys have found most systems to be non-resonant and somewhat dynamically excited. A scenario in which nearly all of the primordial resonant chains undergo dynamical instabilities and collisions has previously been found to closely match many features of the observed planet sample. However, existing models have not been tested against new observations that show a steep decline in the resonant fraction as a function of stellar age on a timescale of  100 Myr. We construct a simplified model incorporating Type I migration, growth from embryos, and N-body integrations continued to 500 Myr and use it to generate a synthetic planet population. Nearly all systems exit the disk phase in a resonant configuration but begin slowly diffusing away from the center of the resonance. Dynamical instabilities can arise on timescales of tens or hundreds of Myr, especially when systems formed in disks with a convergent migration trap. In this case, a secondary chain of smaller planets that remained at their birth location eventually breaks, destabilizing the inner resonant chain. We also show that the instability statistics are well modeled by a Weibull distribution, and use this to extrapolate our population to Gyr ages. The close match of our modeled systems to the observed population implies that the high resonance fraction predicted by this class of models is in fact consistent with the data, and the previously-reported overabundance of resonant systems was a consequence of comparing simulations of early evolution to mature Gyr-old systems. This result also suggests that instabilities triggered by disk dissipation or other very early mechanisms are unlikely to be consistent with observed young systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A glitch in the millisecond pulsar J0900$-$3144</a><span class="id">[2511.11336]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the detection of a glitch in the millisecond pulsar (MSP) PSR J0900$-$3144, which is included in the European, MeerKAT and Parkes pulsar timing array experiments.

The glitch occurred on MJD 59942(17), with a measured fractional spin frequency step of $\Delta \nu_g / \nu=1.15(13) \times 10^{-12}$. This event represents the third glitch detected in a MSP, following those in PSRs B1821$-$24A and J0613$-$0200. Although smaller in amplitude than the previous two, the glitch in PSR J0900$-$3144 is of a comparable order of magnitude. The updated MSP glitch rate is $2.5(1)\times 10^{-3}$ glitches per pulsar per year, which suggests it is likely current PTAs will detect another MSP glitch within five years. Using simulations, we demonstrate that such small glitches can go undetected, especially in short datasets such as those from new PTAs, and can bias the inferred achromatic noise model parameters, potentially leading to the down-weighting of the pulsar in gravitational wave background searches.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11339" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recalibrating Inflation: Insights from Starobinsky Gravity</a><span class="id">[2511.11339]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent analyses of low-redshift supernova and Cepheid data reveal localized shifts in the distance modulus, often interpreted as calibration anomalies or hints of new physics.

Although the physical origin of the plateau remains uncertain, the magnetar energy injection model offers a compelling explanation that reproduces the observed temporal and luminosity features. However, previous studies relying solely on X-ray data have suffered from strong parameter degeneracies when constraining the magnetar parameters. Here we perform broadband afterglow modeling on seven short GRBs with plateau features by combining X-ray, optical, and radio observations within the framework of the magnetar energy injection model. Key model parameters are derived by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. It is found that the energy injection substantially modifies the afterglow dynamics in most events. Compared with X-ray–only analyses, our broadband modeling yields systematically a lower magnetic field strength and a shorter spin period for the central magnetar, corresponding to a higher injection luminosity. The study clearly shows that incorporating multi-wavelength data effectively alleviates the degeneracy between the magnetar parameters and X-ray radiative efficiency. In addition, the distribution of our short GRBs differs markedly from long GRBs when they are plotted on the initial Lorentz factor versus gamma-ray energy plane. This offset, consistent with the observed harder spectrum of short GRBs, may serve as a useful diagnostic for investigating the progenitor as larger samples are available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11492" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 34.6-day transiting sub-Neptune in the TOI-1422 planetary system</a><span class="id">[2511.11492]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>TOI-1422 is a G2 V star ($V = 10.6$ mag) known to host a warm Neptune-sized planet, TOI-1422 b, with a mass and radius of about $9M_{\oplus}$ and $4R_{\oplus}$, on a circular orbit with a period of $12.997$ days. An outer planetary candidate in this system had previously been suggested on the basis of a residual signal in the radial velocity (RV) data with a tentative period of $\sim$29 days, along with a possible single transit-like event, although it was not clear at the time whether the two signals belonged to the same companion. In this work, we confirm the presence of a second transiting planet, TOI-1422 c, a sub-Neptune ($R=2.61\pm0.14 R_{\oplus}$) that orbits with a longer period of 34.563 days. This confirmation is based on the detection of three TESS transits, two from newly available sectors, combined with new and archival RV measurements. The sub-Neptune ($\rho_{\rm c}=4.3^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ g cm$^{-3}$) is more massive than the inner Neptune ($\rho_{\rm b}=0.93^{+0.21}_{-0.20}$ g cm$^{-3}$), having a mass of $M_{\rm c}=14\pm3 M_{\oplus}$, making TOI-1422 a rare anti-ordered system. Furthermore, we detect transit timing variations (TTVs) on the inner planet, with amplitudes of up to 5 hours, suggesting ongoing dynamical interactions. A dynamical analysis that combined TTVs and RVs indicates that planet c alone is unlikely to account for the full TTV amplitude observed on TOI-1422 b. We investigated whether an additional, as yet undetected companion could account for the observed signal, exploring a range of plausible orbital configurations and finding that a low-mass planet located between the two known orbits may be responsible.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mutated Hilltop Inflation in the Era of Present and Future CMB Experiments</a><span class="id">[2511.11534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this article we confront both large-field and small-field sectors of mutated hilltop inflation model with the recent observational results.

Subsequently, we extend our analysis by incorporating the ACT-DR6 data in combination with Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck-2018, and DESI-Y1 observations. In both cases, the predictions of mutated hilltop inflation show good consistency with the observational constraints.

Here also we find that the prediction from mutated hilltop inflation are in tune with those upcoming CMB experiments. The small-field sector of mutated hilltop inflation, in principle, can probe up to $r\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, resulting in a tensor amplitude consistent with current bounds and potentially detectable by next-generation CMB missions. However, accommodating the high observational value of the scalar spectral index may demand relatively higher e-foldings in mutated hilltop inflation.

We do not detect SiO, a potential indicator of giant collisions, but place a limit on the total SiO mass in the system. Unlike previously observed in the infrared, we do not find evidence for variability at millimeter wavelengths when comparing the ALMA continuum observations from 2024 to the pre-collision SMA observations from 2014. We perform modeling of the CO and continuum visibilities and find that both the CO and dust are marginally spatially resolved and are contained to within 20 au from the central star. The modeling of the CO suggests that the outer regions of the disk are gas rich, although further observations are needed to confirm the total gas mass. The evolutionary state of this system has been debated in the literature, and our observations, while not definitive, are generally consistent with the idea that this disk is similar to an evolved protoplanetary or transition/hybrid disk.

The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) will offer unprecedented insights into this era through observations of the redshifted 21-cm signal, enabling constraints on the Universe's reionization history. We investigate the information content of the average neutral hydrogen fraction ($\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$) in several Gaussian (spherical and cylindrical power spectra) and non-Gaussian (Betti numbers and bispectrum) summary statistics of the 21-cm signal. Mock 21-cm observations are generated using the AA* configuration of SKAO's low-frequency telescope, incorporating noise levels for 100 and 1000 hours. We employ a state-of-the-art implicit inference framework to learn posterior distributions of $\bar{x}_{\rm HI}$ in redshift bins centred at $z=8.0,7.2$ and $6.5$, for each statistic and noise scenario, validating the posteriors through calibration tests. Using the figure of merit to assess constraining power, we find that Betti numbers alone are on average more informative than the power spectra, while the bispectrum provides limited constraints. However, combining higher-order statistics with the cylindrical power spectrum improves the mean figure of merit by $\sim$0.25 dex ($\sim33\%$ reduction in $\sigma(\bar{x}_{\rm HI})$). The relative contribution of each statistic varies with the stage of reionization.

Detecting such particles is challenging, as their expected signatures are nuclear recoils with energies below 10 keV, observable solely via ionization. This necessitates a precise understanding of the detector response in this energy regime, which remains incomplete for argon. To address this, the ReD experiment was developed within the framework of the DarkSide-20k Collaboration to produce and characterize few-keV nuclear recoils. A compact dual-phase argon Time Projection Chamber (TPC) was irradiated with neutrons from a Cf252 source, to produce Ar recoils in the energy range of interest via (n,n') elastic scattering. A downstream spectrometer composed of 18 plastic scintillators detected the neutrons scattered off Ar nuclei, enabling recoil energy reconstruction via two-body kinematics. The ionization yield Qy of argon, defined as the number of electrons produced per unit energy deposit, was measured in a model-independent way between 2 and 10 keV. These measurements extend direct experimental coverage well below the previous limit of approximately 7 keV. The results are consistent with existing data above 7 keV, while they indicate a higher Qy at lower energies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping It Renormalizable: Minimal Baryogenesis induced Asymmetric Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2511.10731]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Many asymmetric dark matter scenarios have been proposed to date.

In our framework, nucleons arise as topological solitons stabilized by vector mesons, which are dynamically generated through the path integral bosonization of an underlying Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The restoration of chiral symmetry is implemented dynamically via a self-consistent, density-dependent scalar field, which modifies the (isovector) and (isoscalar) channels of the soliton. We analyze the resulting changes in soliton properties for different NJL parameter sets and demonstrate that the progressive restoration of chiral symmetry leads to a stiffening of the soliton-based EoS, making it compatible with existing neutron star EoSs. An EoS constructed from the solutions of the energy-density and pressure profiles at the center of the nucleon is also explored.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Matter Capture in a Core-Collapse Supernova Revives Dark Photons</a><span class="id">[2511.11219]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Core-collapse supernovae serve as powerful probes of light, weakly coupled particles, such as dark photons. The conventional SN1987A cooling bound constrains the dark photon mass-mixing parameter space by requiring that the luminosity from the proto-neutron star core not exceed the observed neutrino emission. In this work, we revisit these limits by including the effect of dark matter (DM) captured inside the progenitor star before collapse. The trapped DM acts as an additional scattering target for dark photons, modifying their free-streaming length and, consequently, the supernova cooling rate. We perform a self-consistent analysis for both annihilating and asymmetric DM scenarios, incorporating light-mediator effects in the capture rate calculation. For annihilating DM, the equilibrium density remains too small to affect the bounds significantly. In contrast, asymmetric DM can accumulate to large densities, leading to the formation of a &quot;dark photosphere&quot; that suppresses the dark-photon luminosity and reopens previously excluded regions of parameter space. Our results emphasise the importance of accounting for astrophysical DM populations when deriving stellar-cooling constraints on dark sectors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11442" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Influence of Rotation on Fingering Convection in Planetary Cores</a><span class="id">[2511.11442]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stably stratified layers are thought to develop at the top of the liquid metallic cores of many terrestrial planets. We consider the case where the thermal gradient is stable but the compositional gradient is unstable, a situation particularly relevant to Mercury. The strong contrast between molecular diffusivities of temperature and composition leads to fingering convection. We investigate this process using hydrodynamical simulations in a rotating spherical shell, systematically varying the stratification strength N relative to the rotation rate $\Omega$. In all regimes, the primary fingering mode forms narrow, elongated structures that shift orientation from the rotation axis to the direction of gravity as $N^2/\Omega^2$ exceeds 10. The fingers remain laminar, with transverse scales proportional to thermal stratification but independent of rotation. Fingering convection also drives secondary large-scale flows across most of the explored parameter space, producing diverse dynamics including zonal flows, hemispherical convection, axisymmetric poloidal bands, finger clusters, and toroidal gyres. In the rapidly-rotating regime, laterally inhomogeneous mixing generates zonal flows in thermo-compositional wind balance; zonal flow direction and amplitude depend on $N^2/\Omega^2$, with amplitude weakening for strong stratification $N^2/\Omega^2&gt;10$. In the intermediate regime ($N^2/\Omega^2\sim 1$), axisymmetric or spiraling poloidal bands emerge within the tangent cylinder, gradually overtaking the primary fingers. For stronger stratification, finger clusters and weak, large-scale density anomalies surrounded by toroidal gyres form in the upper domain. These diverse large-scale flows may interact with the dynamo-generated magnetic field in the deeper core, potentially influencing surface magnetic fields.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11509" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">\textit{Euclid}: From Galaxies to Gravitational Waves – Forecasting Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background Anisotropies and Their Cross-Correlation</a><span class="id">[2511.11509]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We estimate the amplitude and spatial anisotropy in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) energy density due to compact binary coalescence (CBC) events: binary black holes (BBH), binary neutron stars (BNS), and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers. Our starting point is the Flagship Simulation Galaxy Catalogue developed by the Euclid Consortium. For each galaxy in the Catalogue, we use the simulated mass and starformation to constrain the galaxy's star-formation history, and predict its contribution to the gravitational-wave energy density through CBC mergers. Combining such contributions from all galaxies in the Catalogue results in a prediction for the frequency spectrum and spatial anisotropy of the CBC SGWB. We also compare this prediction to semi-analytical models of SGWB generated by compact binaries. We identify a set of effective parameters that capture the key features of these models, and we apply a Bayesian framework to infer these parameters assuming an ideal scenario of cosmic variance-limited search. This represents the first step toward developing a comprehensive framework that will eventually enable the correlation of SGWB anisotropy and \textit{Euclid} galaxy data, potentially allowing us to extract valuable astrophysical information from this new observable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20091" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gamma-Ray Burst Light Curve Reconstruction: A Comparative Machine and Deep Learning Analysis</a><span class="id">[2412.20091]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), observed at high-z, are probes of the evolution of the Universe and can be used as cosmological tools. Thus, we need correlations with small dispersion among key parameters. To reduce such a dispersion, we mitigate gaps in light curves (LCs), including the plateau region, key to building the two-dimensional Dainotti relation between the end time of plateau emission (Ta) and its luminosity (La). We reconstruct LCs using nine models: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Bi-Mamba, Fourier Transform, Gaussian Process-Random Forest Hybrid (GP-RF), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), Conditional GAN (CGAN), SARIMAX-based Kalman filter, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), and Attention U-Net. These methods are compared to the Willingale model (W07) over a sample of 521 GRBs. MLP and Attention U-Net outperform other methods, with MLP reducing the plateau parameter uncertainties by 37.2% for log Ta, 38.0% for log Fa, and 41.2% for alpha (the post-plateau slope in the W07 model), achieving the lowest 5-fold cross-validation (CV) mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0275. Attention U-Net achieved the lowest uncertainty of parameters, a 37.9% reduction in log Ta, a 38.5% reduction in log Fa and a 41.4% reduction in alpha, but with a higher MSE of 0.134. Although Attention U-Net achieves the largest uncertainty reduction, the MLP attains the lowest test MSE while maintaining comparable uncertainty performance, making it the more reliable model. The other methods yield MSE values ranging from 0.0339 to 0.174. These improvements in parameter precision are needed to use GRBs as standard candles, investigate theoretical models, and predict GRB redshifts through machine learning.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anatomy of Parity-violating Trispectra in Galaxy Surveys</a><span class="id">[2504.02931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Parity-violating interactions are ubiquitous phenomena in particle physics. If they are significant during cosmic inflation, they can leave imprints on primordial perturbations and be observed in correlation functions of galaxy surveys. Importantly, parity-violating signals in the four-point correlation functions (4PCFs) cannot be generated by Einstein gravity in the late universe on large scales, making them unique and powerful probes of high-energy physics during inflation. However, the complex structure of the 4PCF poses challenges in diagnosing the underlying properties of parity-violating interactions from observational data. In this work, we introduce a general framework that provides a streamlined pipeline directly from a particle model in inflation to galaxy 4PCFs in position space. We demonstrate this framework with a series of toy models, effective-field-theory-like models, and full models featuring tree-level exchange-type processes with chemical-potential-induced parity violation. We further showed the detection sensitivity of these models from BOSS data and highlighted potential challenges in data interpretation and model prediction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07962" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Establishing a Connection Between the Jet and the Corona in Black Hole Low Mass X-Ray Binaries</a><span class="id">[2505.07962]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Low-mass black hole X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) undergo outbursts, during which their brightness increases greatly for timescales of months. The X-ray accretion and radio jet properties change dramatically throughout an outburst in a broadly consistent way between sources. Changes to the accretion flow and the corona are evident through X-ray spectral variations, while the jet's evolution produces changes in the radio. Typically, high energy emission from the corona initially dominate the X-ray spectrum, and quasi-steady compact jets are observed in the radio. As the outburst progresses, emission from the corona fades and is superseded by lower energy X-ray accretion disk emission. During this transition, the compact jets are quenched and discrete ejecta, called transient jets, are launched. The concurrence of the corona's weakening and the jet's transition from compact to transient implies a connection, but the precise relationship has not been established. Motivated by this, we aim to investigate the corona-jet connection. We perform spectral modeling in the hard and soft X-ray, utilizing $NuSTAR$, $NICER$, and $Swift$/XRT observations to track the evolving X-ray corona for three LMXBs: MAXI J1348-630, MAXI J1535-571 and MAXI J1820+070. We use prior work to mark the presence of compact jets and the dates of discrete jet ejections. We find a clear connection between the evolution of the corona and the jet: across all three sources an increase in the distance of the corona from the black hole occurs near the time that the compact jet is quenched and the transient jet is launched.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accurate $N$-body simulations with local Primordial non-Gaussianities: initial conditions and aliasing</a><span class="id">[2506.06200]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>New generation galaxy surveys targeting constraints on local primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) demand $N$-body simulations that accurately reproduce its effects. In this work, we explore various prescriptions for the initial conditions of simulations with PNG, aiming to optimise accuracy and minimise numerical errors, particularly due to aliasing. We have used $186$ runs that vary the starting redshift, LPT order, and non-Gaussianities ($f^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$ and $g^{\rm local}_{\rm NL}$). Starting with $3$LPT at a redshift as low as $z_{\rm ini}\simeq 11.5$ reproduces to $&lt;1 \%$ the power spectrum, bispectrum and halo mass function of a high-resolution reference simulation. The aliasing induced by the PNG terms in the power spectrum produces a $ \leq 3 \%$ excess small-scale power at the initial conditions, dropping below $0.1\%$ by $z=0$. State-of-the-art initial condition generators show a sub-percent agreement. We show that initial conditions for simulations with PNG should be established at a lower redshift using higher-order LPT schemes. We also show that removing the PNG aliasing signal is unnecessary for current simulations. The methodology proposed here can accelerate the generation of simulations with PNG while enhancing their accuracy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22936" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Braking index of the frequently glitching PSR J0537$-$6910</a><span class="id">[2506.22936]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The pulsar J0537$-$6910 undergoes spin-up glitches more frequently than any other known pulsar, at a rate of roughly thrice per year. Its glitches are typically large and accompanied by spin-down rate changes $\Delta\dot\nu$ that partially recover with a nearly constant positive frequency second derivative $\ddot\nu$ for the post-glitch intervals. The long-term value of $\ddot\nu$, however, is negative because $\dot\nu$ has decreased over the years of observations. We wish to determine if permanent shifts (non-relaxing parts of the glitch change $\Delta\dot\nu$ in the spin-down rate, like those observed in the Crab pulsar) can explain the long-term enhancement of the spin-down rate which results in an effective negative braking index. We demonstrate, as a proof of concept, that the actual braking index associated with the pulsar's braking torque can be n 3 if the internal superfluid torque and permanent shifts are considered. We use published RXTE and NICER data to calculate the average permanent shift per glitch needed to bring an underlying braking index $n$ to the effective long-term value n' =-1.2 inferred from the data. We use this average value as the actual permanent shift in each glitch and extract the contributions of the internal and external torques to $\ddot\nu$, under the assumption that the next glitch occurs when all glitch-induced offsets to internal torques are fully restored. We find that if the braking index of the magnetospheric torque is close to n 3, moderate permanent changes of the spin-down rate are required, similar to those inferred for the Crab pulsar. The natural mechanism to produce such permanent changes is crustquakes. Crustal failure associated with PSR J0537$-$6910 glitches can have interesting and potentially observable consequences, such as transient changes of the X-ray emission, activation of radio emission, or emission of gravitational waves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13039" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EP250207b is not a collapsar fast X-ray transient.

Recent progress through multi-wavelength follow-up of Einstein Probe discovered FXTs has shown that several are related to collapsars, which can also produce gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this paper we investigate the nature of the FXT EP250207b. The VLT/MUSE spectra of a nearby (15.9 kpc in projection) lenticular galaxy reveal no signs of recent star formation. If this galaxy is indeed the host, EP250207b lies at a redshift of z=0.082, implying a peak observed absolute magnitude for the optical counterpart of M_r=-14.5. At the time when supernovae (SNe) would peak, it is substantially fainter than all SN types. These results are inconsistent with a collapsar origin for EP250207b. The properties favour a binary compact object merger driven origin. The X-ray, optical and radio observations are compared with predictions of several types of extra-galactic transients, including afterglow and kilonova models. The data can be fit with a slightly off-axis viewing angle afterglow. However, the late-time ( 30 day) optical/NIR counterpart is too bright for the afterglow and also for conventional kilonova models. This could be remedied if that late emission is due to a globular cluster or the core of a (tidally disrupted) dwarf galaxy. If confirmed, this would be the first case where the multi-wavelength properties of an FXT are found to be consistent with a compact object merger origin, increasing the parallels between FXTs and GRBs. We finally discuss if the source could originate in a higher redshift host galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Impact of Spectroscopic Redshift Errors on Cosmological Measurements</a><span class="id">[2508.21182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic redshift errors, including redshift uncertainty and catastrophic failures, can bias cosmological measurements from galaxy redshift surveys at sub-percent level. In this work, we investigate their impact on the full-shape analysis using contaminated mock catalogs. We find that redshift uncertainty introduces a scale-dependent damping effect on the power spectrum, which is absorbed by counterterms in clustering model, keeping parameter biases below $5\%$. Catastrophic failures suppress the power spectrum amplitude by an approximately constant factor that scales with the catastrophic rate $f_c$. While this effect is negligible for DESI galaxy populations ($f_c=1\%$), the slitless-like errors, combining redshift uncertainty with $f_c=5\%$ catastrophics, introduce significant biases in cosmological constraints. In this case, we observe $6\%$ to $16\%$ shifts ($\sim1.5\sigma$ level) in estimating the fractional growth rate $df\equiv f/f^{\rm{fid}}$ and the log primordial amplitude $\ln(10^{10} A_{s})$. Applying the correction factor $(1-f_c)^2$ on the galaxy power spectrum mitigates the bias but weakens the parameter constraints due to new degeneracies. Alternatively, fixing $f_c$ to its expected value restores the constraining power with a modest bias of $0.7\sigma$. Our results indicate that for space-based slitless surveys such as \textit{Euclid}, at minimum accurate estimation of $f_c$ and its incorporation into the clustering model are essential to get unbiased cosmological inference. Extending to evolving dark energy and massive neutrino cosmologies, redshift errors do not bias the dark energy properties parametrized by $w_0$ and $w_a$, but can degrade constraints on the summed neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu$ by up to 80% in the worst case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07259" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing the Cosmological Principle with CMB lensing and cosmic shear</a><span class="id">[2509.07259]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The standard cosmological model assumes the Cosmological Principle.

Our signal-to-noise forecasts reveal that information from the $\kappa$-$B$ cross-correlation is primarily contained on large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 200$). We find that this cross-correlation for a Euclid-like galaxy survey is sensitive to anisotropy at the percent level.

The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities, including Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and EP, providing early optical positions for coordinated multiwavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical afterglow localisation and multiband follow-up of five Fermi/GBM (240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and 241228B) and two MAXI/GSC (240122A and 240225B) triggered long GRBs (LGRBs) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields precise redshifts spanning $z\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying $&gt;3\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble those of typical LGRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the LGRBs' average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic energies ($E_{jet}\sim10^{51-52}$)erg, consistent with the canonical LGRB population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and central engine diversity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13920" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Recovering the Coupled Treatment of Redshift-Space Distortions and the Lightcone Effect after Diffuse Foreground Removal</a><span class="id">[2509.13920]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The 21 cm brightness temperature during the Epoch of Reionisation is widely modelled using semi-numeric simulations, used for their computational speed and flexibility in testing astrophysical and cosmological parameters. However, it is common practice to simulate coeval brightness temperature boxes, and then apply post-processing algorithms that treat the lightcone effect and redshift-space distortions separately, assuming they can be added in sequence. We instead model them together, allowing for partial coeval cell contributions, and ensuring that velocity-induced frequency shifts are computed at the correct cosmic time for every position along the line of sight. We show that considering these effects simultaneously creates a difference in the shape of the power spectrum over all Fourier scales, and remains recoverable after semi-blind foreground removal. We show that our lightcones consist of an average of 8% and maximum of 120% of a coeval cell length. These contributions to a 21cm brightness temperature lightcone voxel are shifted from within a +/- 0.5 MHz range of the emitted frequency. The boost in the power spectrum seen over small scales (k&gt;1.5 Mpc) of our robust 21 cm lightcone method compared to basic methods is recoverable after the addition and removal of diffuse radio foregrounds. The largest differences during the Epoch of Reionisation lie in the k-space, where the noise sensitivity for a 1000-hour SKAO-low observation is greater than the signal. However, in the cosmic dawn, we have shown that the major differences lie outside of this noise-dominated region.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25338" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-modal atmospheric characterization of $β$ Pictoris b: Adding high-resolution continuum spectra from GRAVITY</a><span class="id">[2509.25338]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first VLTI/GRAVITY observations at R$_\lambda \sim 4000$ of $\beta$ Pic b.

We also upgrade our forward modeling code ForMoSA to account for the data multi-modality and combine the GRAVITY epochs with published 1-5 $\mu$m photometry, low- to medium-resolution spectra (0.9-7 $\mu$m), and high-resolution echelle spectra (2.1-5.2 $\mu$m). Sonora and Exo-REM are statistically preferred. Exo-REM yields $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1607.45^{+4.85}_{-6.20}$ K and log(g) $=4.46^{+0.02}_{-0.04}$ dex from GRAVITY alone, and $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $=1502.74^{+2.32}_{-2.14}$ K and log(g) $=4.00\pm0.01$ dex when including all datasets. Archival data significantly affect the retrieved parameters. C/O remains solar ($0.552^{+0.003}_{-0.002}$) while [M/H] reaches super-solar values (0.50$\pm$0.01). We report the first tentative constraint on log($^{12}$CO/$^{13}$CO) $\sim$1.12, though this remains inconclusive due to telluric residuals. Additionally, we estimate the luminosity to be log(L/L$_\odot$) $=-4.01^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, implying a heavy-element content of up to $\sim$5% (20-80 M$_\oplus$) given the system age and dynamical mass measurements. Access to both continuum and molecular lines at K-band significantly impacts the metallicity, possibly owing to collision-induced absorption shaping the continuum. Echelle spectra do not dominate the final fit with respect to lower resolution data.

Such birefringence induces a nonzero cross-correlation between the CMB $E$- and $B$-modes, providing a direct observational signature of parity violation. Recent measurements of the $EB$ and $TB$ power spectra, however, cannot yet unambiguously separate instrumental miscalibration ($\alpha$) from a true cosmic-rotation angle ($\beta$). For this reason, we perform a model-independent analysis in terms of the total effective rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We analyze the latest $EB$ and $TB$ measurements from the SPIDER, Planck, and ACT experiments and derive constraints on the Chern-Simons coupling constant $gM_{Pl}$ and on the polarization rotation angle $\alpha+\beta$. We find that the coupling $gM_{Pl}$ is not compatible with the SPIDER data, while it provides reasonable fits to the Planck and ACT measurements. The fits for $\alpha+\beta$ prefer a value larger than zero: when combined, Planck+ACT yield a detection significance of approximately 7$\sigma$.

This work provides a framework to characterize cloud and climate properties of close-in gas giants via transit depth asymmetries from the optical to the infrared (0.33 ...10 $\mu$m). The AFGKM ExoRad 3D GCM grid provides gas temperature profiles for an ensemble of 50 tidally locked gaseous planets orbiting diverse host stars. It is combined with a detailed kinetic cloud formation model. The end result is a set of synthetic transit spectra and evening-to-morning transit asymmetries that span climate regimes: warm (T=800 K ... 1000K), intermediately hot (T=1200 K ... 2000 K) and ultrahot (T =2200 K ... 2600 K). WASP-39b observations suggest iron-free clouds with less abundant cloud condensation nuclei than previously expected. The ensemble study shows that clouds increase transit limb differences due to asymmetries in cloud coverage and by enhancing horizontal differences in the gas temperatures. For hot planets, evening-to-morning differences of up to 150 ppm are suggested in the optical and 100 ppm in the infrared (2-8 micron). For ultra-hot Jupiters, evening-to-morning transit differences are dominated by the morning cloud for a cloud-free evening limb: They are strongly negative in the PLATO band (0.5-1 $\mu$m, -500 ppm), moderately negative in the near-infrared (1-1.5 $\mu$m, -200 ppm) and moderately positive (+100 ppm) for $\lambda &gt; 2\mu$m. For a partly cloudy evening terminator, the evening-to-morning transit asymmetry is moderately positive in the whole wavelength range. Warm Jupiter planets exhibit negligible transit asymmetries. PLATO and JWST transit asymmetry observations between 1-2 $\mu$m are optimal to characterize cloudy planetary atmospheres around K -A stars. JWST observations are most effective for M star planets with transit differences &gt; +500 ppm for 8-10 $\mu$m.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09489" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Distribution of the Key Species on the Surface of Europa</a><span class="id">[2511.09489]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The icy surface of Europa is continuously bombarded by ions and electrons from Jupiter's magnetosphere. The bombardment of the particles dissociates water molecules on the surface of Europa and introduces impurities to the icy surface. Such processes lead to the generation of the nonwater species on the surface of Europa. These chemical species are closely related to the chemistry of the icy crust and the subsurface ocean, as well as Europa's habitability. However, our knowledge of the global distribution of these species is limited due to the sparse satellite and telescope observations on Europa. In this study, we combine a Europa plasma model and a chemical-transport model to simulate the global distribution of the key nonwater species on the surface of Europa. The initial results from our model agree well with the existing observations on the distributions of H2SO4 and SO2 but they show a significant discrepancy with the observed distribution of H2O2. Sensitivity tests on the reaction rate coefficients indicate that the simulated global distribution of all three species fit the observations well if the reaction rate coefficients in the ice are reduced by one order of magnitude. This finding provides a useful constraint on the rate coefficient of the chemical reactions in the ice. Furthermore, our model predicts that the O2 on the surface ice of Europa is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. The simulated global distribution of the key species on Europa may provide useful guidance for future missions to Europa, such as Europa Clipper and JUICE.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09630" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: I.

We find that SKA could be the first experiment to discover dark photons with a mass between $10^{-13}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as small as $\sim 10^{-8}$ by cross-correlating their data with a low-redshift galaxy survey, potentially improving on the sensitivity from a similar analysis using Planck data by a factor of 4 in $\epsilon$. This improvement is largely due to an enhancement of the signal at low frequencies and the unique experimental advantages of radio telescopes such as small beam sizes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09637" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dark Photons in the Radio Sky: II. Resonant Conversions in the Intergalactic Medium</a><span class="id">[2511.09637]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is the second part in a pair of papers forecasting the sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to dark photons, a highly motivated, simple extension of the Standard Model. Through a kinetic mixing term, visible photons from the cosmic microwave background can resonantly convert into dark photons, generating new temperature anisotropies in the sky. In this work, we detail the entire analysis pipeline that we use to compute SKA's sensitivity, focusing on resonant conversions that occur in the intergalactic medium. We also discuss the sensitivity of 21-cm experiments to dark photons. Our results show that both SKA in combination with galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments could discover dark photons with masses between $5\times 10^{-15}$ and $5\times 10^{-12}$ eV, and kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ as low as $10^{-8}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</a><span class="id">[2409.08536]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-Bénard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) – a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) – to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demonstration that Differential Length Changes of Optical Cavities are a Sensitive Probe for Ultralight Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2412.20623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Measurements of differential length oscillations of Fabry-Perot cavities provide a sensitive and promising approach to searching for scalar ultralight dark matter (ULDM).

In this work, we examine the impact of pQCD information on the inference of the EOS using a nonparametric framework based on Gaussian processes (GPs). We examine the application of pQCD constraints through a &quot;pQCD likelihood,&quot; and verify the findings of previous works; namely, a softening of the EOS at the central densities of the most massive neutron stars and a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass. Although the pQCD likelihood can be easily integrated into existing EOS inference frameworks, this approach requires an arbitrary selection of the density at which the constraints are applied. The EOS behavior is also treated differently on either side of the chosen density. To mitigate these issues, we extend the EOS model to higher densities, thereby constructing a &quot;unified&quot; description of the EOS from the neutron-star crust to densities relevant for pQCD. In this approach the pQCD constraints effectively become part of the prior. Since the EOS is unconstrained by any calculation or data between the densities applicable to neutron stars and pQCD, we argue for maximum modeling flexibility in that regime. We compare the unified EOS with the traditional pQCD likelihood, and although we confirm the EOS softening, we do not see a reduction in the maximum neutron-star mass or any impact on macroscopic observables. Though residual model dependence cannot be ruled out, we find that pQCD suggests the speed of sound in the densest neutron-star cores has already started decreasing toward the asymptotic limit; we find that the speed of sound squared at the center of the most massive neutron star has an upper bound of $\sim 0.5$ at the $90\%$ level.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00344" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth-Scattering Induced Modulation in Low-Threshold Dark Matter Experiments</a><span class="id">[2507.00344]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter particles with sufficiently large interactions with ordinary matter can scatter in the Earth before reaching and scattering in a detector. This induces a modulation in the signal rate with a period of one sidereal day. We calculate this modulation for sub-GeV dark matter particles that interact either with a heavy or an ultralight dark-photon mediator and investigate the resulting signal in low-threshold detectors consisting of silicon, xenon, or argon targets. The scattering in the Earth is dominated by dark matter scatters off nuclei, while the signal in the detector is easiest to observe from dark matter scattering off electrons. We investigate the properties of the modulation signal and provide projections of the sensitivity of future experiments. We find that a search for a modulation signal can probe new regions of parameter space near the energy thresholds of current experiments, where the data are typically dominated by backgrounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08379" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Precision calculation of $N_{\text{eff}}$ with Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo</a><span class="id">[2508.08379]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Neutrino Direct Simulation Monte Carlo ($\nu$DSMC) is a Monte Carlo method for solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the early Universe, designed to track the evolution of cosmic neutrinos across a wide range of cosmological scenarios.

The latter is considered fixed during the average over one orbital revolution of the inner binary by means of which its orbital perturbations are calculated. The results are presented in a compact form that facilitates a straightforward application, for example, to the cases of the eclipsing binary 2M1510 AB made of two brown dwarfs, the supermassive black hole-or megapyknon-M87$^\ast$ and our solar system, although they are not limited to such interesting astronomical scenarios alone. The aforementioned systems may all have in common the presence of a distant point mass perturbing in some ways their inner dynamics. That is, respectively, a circumbinary exoplanet whose orbital plane should be perpendicular to that of its host inner binary, an intermediate mass black hole potentially causing the observed jet precession, and a still unseen planet, known as Telisto or Planet Nine, which may, perhaps, have been recently spotted in archival images although in a quite different orbit with respect to that originally expected. For each of the considered cases, exclusion plots in their parameter spaces are provided.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</a><span class="id">[2511.02118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler–Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stochastic Limit of Growing Gravitational Wave Memory from Sources in the Early Universe and Astrophysical Sources</a><span class="id">[2511.06548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that the stochastic background of gravitational wave memory of growing type leads to a fractional Brownian motion increasing at the order of $t^{H}$ for large $t$ where $\frac{1}{2} &lt; H &lt;1$. This beats the scaling law of Brownian motion. In this article we investigate sources of gravitational waves in the early universe as well as in astrophysical settings. Cosmological sources may include primordial black holes or other sources immediately after the Big Bang when there were pockets of hot material, and large density fluctuations. Gravitational waves from mergers of primordial black holes produce memory. We show that due to the conditions in which these are taking place the gravitational wave memory will be increasing in time following a certain power law. Corresponding results hold for any gravitational wave memory from a cosmological source where the surrounding conditions are similar. The stochastic limit of these memories is a stochastic process growing in time faster than the $\sqrt{t}$ scaling law of Brownian motion. The latter is also typical for noise and for the limit of memory events as they have been mostly considered in the literature. In an expanding universe, the memory is enhanced by the expansion itself. Our results provide a tool to extract gravitational wave sources of this type from data using this memory signature. This would be particularly useful for the PTA data that has been already observed, answering the long-standing question on how to extract memory signals from the data. Further, the new results open up a new door to explore the conditions right after the Big Bang using the long-range dependence and further probability analysis.</p></div></details></article></body>
