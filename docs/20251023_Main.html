Recent research supports the “breaking-the-chains” hypothesis, which proposes that compact systems typically form in chains of mean-motion resonances (MMRs) but subsequently break out on a $\sim 100$Myr timescale. We investigate a scenario for breaking the chains through intermittent flybys of planetesimals originating from a distant reservoir. Using $N$-body simulations and semi-analytical calculations, we characterize the disruption of MMRs through these flybys. We find a planetesimal reservoir of total mass $\gtrsim 0.04 M_{\oplus}$ is required to disrupt MMR chains, depending on the mass distribution and the typical number of flybys executed by each planetesimal. We verify that systems disrupted in this way are frequently unstable to close encounters within $\sim 100$Myr of the final flyby. This mechanism operates in systems with both a sufficiently massive reservoir and an efficient mechanism for planetesimal injection. Consequently, we predict an anti-correlation between resonant inner systems and dynamically active outer configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A resistive MHD module in the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X</a><span class="id">[2510.18968]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Relativistic macroscopic plasma dynamics can be described by general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. In many high-energy astrophysical settings, such as the interior dynamics of magnetized stars, the ideal GRMHD approximation, in which we assume infinite conductivity, provides an excellent description. However, ideal GRMHD neglects resistive effects that are essential for processes such as magnetic reconnection, dissipation, and magnetospheric dynamics. Incorporating resistivity into astrophysical plasma models accounts for the fact that plasmas in such environments are not perfect conductors. We present a resistive version of the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code GRaM-X, which evolves the full resistive GRMHD equations using the Z4c formalism for Einstein's equations. We implement a second-order implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta scheme to handle stiff source terms, obtain the primitive quantities from the conserved quantities using a one-dimensional recovery method, and employ the HLLE Riemann solver in combination with TVD and WENO reconstruction schemes. We validate the module using a range of standard tests, including 1D shocktubes, current sheets, Alfvén waves, 2D cylindrical explosions, and 3D TOV stars. The results of these tests demonstrate accurate recovery of the ideal MHD limit, correct resistive behavior, and stable evolution in dynamical spacetimes. Leveraging the GPU-accelerated resistive version of GRaM-X enables efficient large-scale simulations, paving the way for realistic studies of binary mergers, accretion flows, and relativistic jets within the framework of multi-messenger astrophysics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eccentric discs as a gateway to giant planets outward migration</a><span class="id">[2510.18970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies on planet-dominated Type II migration demonstrated the presence of a correlation between the direction of planet migration and the parameter K describing the depth of the planetary gap. It was found that high (low) value for K correspond to outward (inward) migration. In this paper we aim at understanding the mechanism driving inward/outward migration and why it correlates with the gap depth. We performed a suite of 2D, live-planet, long-term simulations of massive planets migrating in discs with the hydro-code Fargo3D. We focus on a range of planet masses (1-13 m_J) and disc aspect ratios (0.03-0.1) and analyze the evolution of orbital elements and gap structure. We also study the torque contributions from outer Lindblad resonances to investigate their role in the migration outcome. We find that, while all planets initially migrate inwards, those with high enough K eventually enter a phase in which the torque reverses sign and migration becomes outwards, until eventually stalling. This behavior is associated with eccentricity growth in the outer disc and changes in the gap structure. We identify the surface density ratio at the 1:2 and 1:3 outer Lindblad resonances as a key output diagnostic that correlates with the migration direction. This ratio regulates the migration for all the cases where the massive planet remains in an almost circular orbit and the outer gap region exhibits moderate eccentricity. This characteristic sequence of inward-reversal-outwards-stalling occurs for a variety of K values and thus further work is required to identify the simulation input parameters that determine the onset of this sequence. Our results suggest that outward migration in the planet-dominated regime is primarily governed by the relative importance of the 1:2 and 1:3 resonances and, therefore, the gap profile plays a crucial role in determining the direction of migration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18981" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lensing Counter Narrative: An Effective Description of Small-Scale Clustering in Weak Lensing Power Spectra</a><span class="id">[2510.18981]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new formalism to separate large- and small-scale contributions to cosmic shear through $\textit{lensing counterterms}$ (LCT) inspired by effective field theory (EFT). Marginalizing over these LCTs isolates the large-scale cosmological signal in weak lensing power spectra while simultaneously constraining the impact of baryonic feedback or new physics (e.g. axion dark matter) at small scales. Our formalism removes the need for hard scale cuts in standard analyses, even when theoretical predictions are limited to below a physical cutoff $\Lambda$, resulting in significant improvements in constraining power – up to $5\times$ smaller in the case of a LSST-Y10-like analysis without marginalizing over baryons when the analysis cutoff is set to $\Lambda = 1.0h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. We conduct a proof-of-principle analysis on the publicly available DES Y3 data, finding $S_8= 0.761\pm 0.045$ and $S_8 = 0.794\pm 0.040$ for analyses with cutoffs of $\Lambda = 0.5h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and $1.0 h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, respectively, with no detection of modifications to small-scale clustering at $k &gt; \Lambda$ beyond the predictions of collisionless dark matter in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. We make our $\texttt{JAX}$-based pipeline, $\texttt{gholax}$, integrated with intrinsic alignment predictions from the EFT of large-scale structure at 1-loop, publicly available.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19010" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on Axion-Like Particles from VERITAS Observations of a Flaring Radio Galaxy in the Perseus Cluster</a><span class="id">[2510.19010]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Background: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are hypothetical particles that emerge in numerous theoretical extensions to the Standard Model. Their coupling to electromagnetic field implies that ALPs would mix with photons in the presence of external magnetic fields. As ALP phenomenology is governed by the mass and strength of its coupling, there is a subset of this parameter space in which this mixing would be expected to leave an imprint on the spectra of TeV gamma-ray sources. Data: In 2017, the VERITAS gamma-ray observatory recorded the second day of a dramatic flare of the radio galaxy NGC 1275, embedded at the center of the Perseus galaxy cluster. This serendipitous locale provides a spatially-extended magnetic field of strength O(10$\mu$G) through which escaping photons traverse, making it an excellent target to study ALPs. Methods: We analyze the VERITAS data of NGC 1275's 2017 flare with the gammapy analysis package. Extensive fitting and modeling are performed to ultimately conduct a likelihood analysis used to search for any evidence of a preference for ALPs and to explore the confidence with which constraints can be set. We adopt the CLs method for this study for its conservative approach to setting limits in regimes where the search has limited sensitivity. Results: No evidence for the existence of ALPs is found, and no combination of mass and coupling strength can be excluded at or above 95% confidence level. We provide a map showing the strength of our exclusions in the mass and coupling parameter space. The strongest exclusions are found in the mass range $2 \times 10^{-7}$eV $\lesssim m_a \lesssim 4 \times 10^{-7}$eV and at the coupling strength of $g_{a\gamma} \gtrsim 3 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$ up to 80% confidence level, which are consistent with previous studies. Conclusions: We find the CLs method to be a trustworthy approach, and advocate for its...</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A very young and fast rotating shell star discovered in the eclipsing binary ZTF J200347.63+394429.8</a><span class="id">[2510.19023]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A photometric study in combination with existing stellar models has revealed details of this eclipsing post-mass-transfer binary.

Motivated by ongoing debates surrounding back-reaction effects and observed anomalies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we investigate whether a departure from isotropy in the late Universe could reconcile the observed discrepancies in Hubble constant measurements. Using a Bayesian inference framework, we constrain the model parameters employing multiple nested sampling algorithms: bilby, PyMultiNest, and nessai. We perform the analysis under both uniform and Gaussian priors, allowing us to systematically assess the sensitivity of the inferred cosmological parameters to different prior assumptions. This dual-prior strategy balances agnostic parameter exploration with constraints informed by theory and observation. Our findings demonstrate the reliability of our inference pipeline across different samplers and emphasize the crucial role of prior selection in non-standard cosmological model testing. The results suggest that anisotropic models remain viable contenders in addressing current cosmological tensions: even though the present model does not show alleviation of the Hubble tension, the data points towards anisotropies. Future work may extend this methodology to more complex anisotropic scenarios and incorporate additional cosmological probes such as CMB polarization and gravitational wave standard sirens.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19102" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-ray Observations of Nova Scorpii 2023 (V1716 Sco) in Outburst</a><span class="id">[2510.19102]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nova Scorpii 2023 was first detected as a luminous supersoft X-ray source (SSS) 93 days after outburst and continued emitting soft X-rays for over two months, until it was too close to the Sun to observe. The nova was monitored with the Swift X-ray Telescope (XRT) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) on the International Space Station, and in long exposures with the Chandra High Resolution Camera (HRC) and Low Energy Transmission Grating (LETG) on days 128, 129, and 183-185 after optical maximum. Swift detected a rapidly decaying SSS when observations resumed, constraining the constant bolometric luminosity phase to 9 months. The SSS flux was irregularly variable. A nearly three-fold increase in flux was observed between August and October 2023 in the 15 to 35 Angstrom range, from 3.5 x 10^(-11) to 9.4 x 10^(-11) erg cm^(-2) s^(-1). The SSS duration and effective temperature derived from the October LETG spectra indicate a massive white dwarf with temperature fitting nova evolutionary tracks for a 1.2 solar mass WD; emission lines superimposed on the WD continuum are attributed to surrounding shocked ejecta. We present a timing study based on Chandra and archival NICER data. The irregular variability timescale was days, but a 77.9 second periodic modulation in the SSS flux with varying amplitude was measured in many observations. Our analysis shows that this period was stable; short drifts derived with NICER, but not in long, uninterrupted Chandra exposures, are artifacts of measuring variable amplitude modulation. We suggest the modulations are associated with the WD rotation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linking Magnetic Field Diagnostics with 3D CME Speeds in Solar Active Regions</a><span class="id">[2510.19125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding how active-region properties influence coronal mass ejection (CME) dynamics is essential for constraining eruption models and improving space-weather prediction. Magnetic diagnostics derived above polarity inversion lines (PILs), including the critical height ($h_{\rm crit}$) of torus instability onset, the overlying field strength ($B_{\rm t}$), and ribbon flux ($R_{\rm f}$), provide physically motivated measures of eruption onset. The two main aims of this work are to (i) show that $h_{\rm crit}$ and $B_{\rm t}$ can equally well predict CME speeds when evaluated over the region of interest (ROI) not directly above the PIL, and (ii) assess the value of $h_{\rm crit}$, $B_{\rm t}$ and $R_{\rm f}$ in predicting CME speed. Photospheric magnetograms are modeled with potential-field extrapolations to obtain decay index profiles. Critical heights above PILs correlate strongly with 3D CME speed ($r = 0.71$). Using ROIs of $\approx$ 1.8, 3.7, and 7.3 Mm), centered on the PIL, weighted $h_{\rm crit}$ from the 7.3x7.3 ROI provides the strongest correlation ($r = 0.73$), while mean $B_{\rm t}$ at 150 Mm is weaker ($r = 0.33$). Combining both offers little improvement ($r = 0.74$), confirming $h_{\rm crit}$ as the dominant predictor. CME speed correlates moderately with $B_{\rm t} \times R_{\rm f}$ ($r = 0.44$), and highest when combined with $h_{\rm crit}$ ($r = 0.76$). Thus, in potential field models, ROI-based critical heights are as predictive as those above the PIL, indicating that the broader active-region field structure is equally valid as a diagnostic. When all parameters are considered together, $h_{\rm crit}$ alone consistently shows the highest predictive power for CME speed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19132" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of Energy Injection in the Short and Distant GRB 250221A</a><span class="id">[2510.19132]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the short-duration GRB 250221A ($T_{90}=1.80\pm0.32$ s), using a data set from the optical facilities COLIBRÍ, the Harlingten 50 cm Telescope, and the Very Large Telescope. We complement these observations with data from the \textit{Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} and the \textit{Einstein Probe}, as well as radio observations from the Very Large Array. GRB 250221A is among the few short GRBs with direct afterglow spectroscopy, which gives a secure redshift determination of $z=0.768$ and allows the unambiguous identification of the host as a galaxy with a star-formation rate of $\sim3\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. The X-ray and optical light curves up to $T_0+10$ ks (where $T_0$ refers to the GRB trigger time) are well described by forward-shock synchrotron emission in the slow-cooling regime within the standard fireball framework. However, at $T_0+0.6$ days, both the X-ray and optical bands exhibit an excess over the same interval, which we interpret as evidence of energy injection into a jet with a half-opening angle of $\theta_j=11.5^{\circ}$ through a refreshed shock powered by late central engine activity or a radially stratified ejecta. The burst properties (duration, spectral hardness, peak energy, and location in the Amati plane) all favour a compact binary merger origin. However, our modelling of the afterglow suggests a dense circumburst medium ($n\sim80$ cm$^{-3}$), which is more typical of a Collapsar environment. This tension over the classification of this burst (short-hard vs. long-soft) as inferred from the prompt and afterglow emissions makes GRB 250221A an unusual event and underscores the limitations of duration-based classifications and the importance of multi-wavelength, time-resolved follow-up observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19143" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2510.19143]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Eighteen years after their discovery, the astronomical sources and radiation mechanisms of fast radio bursts remain mysterious. Their radiation is as bright as that of pulsars, with brightness temperatures as high as $\sim 10^{36}$ K, implying coherent emission, but the plasma physics that forms the coherent charge bunches, with net charges of order a Coulomb, is not understood. Some FRB have been identified with galaxies at redshifts of a few tenths, but one originated within a globular cluster in the galaxy M81 at a distance of 3.6 Mpc. A minority of FRB have been observed to repeat, in some cases thousands of times. The vast majority of FRB have not been observed to repeat, but it is not known if they are truly “one-offs” or repeat at unobservably long intervals. Some FRB originate within dense, rapidly varying, plasma environments, while others appear to be surrounded by high vacuum.

We present a sub-2% measurement of the Hubble constant that is independent of this scale, using data from the first data release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI DR1). Building on previous work, we remove dependency on the sound horizon size using a heuristic rescaling procedure at the power spectrum level. A key innovation is the inclusion of \emph{uncalibrated} (agnostic to $r_s$) post-reconstruction BAO measurements from DESI DR1, as well as using the CMB acoustic scale $\theta_*$ as a high-redshift anchor. Uncalibrated type-Ia supernovae are often included as an independent source of $\Omega_m$ information; here we demonstrate the robustness of our results by additionally considering two supernova-independent alternative datasets. We find somewhat higher values of $H_0$ relative to our previous work: $69.2^{+1.3}_{-1.4}$, $70.3^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$, and $69.6^{+1.3}_{-1.8}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ respectively when including measurements from i) Planck/ACT CMB lensing $\times$ unWISE galaxies, ii) the DES Year 3 6$\times$2pt analysis, and iii) Planck/ACT CMB lensing + the DES Year 5 supernova analysis. These remarkably consistent constraints achieve better than 2% precision; they are among the most stringent sound horizon-independent measurements from LSS to date, and provide a powerful avenue for probing the origin of the Hubble tension.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Compact Multi-Planet System of Three Transiting Giant Planets Around TIC118798035</a><span class="id">[2510.19162]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery and characterization of three transiting giant planets in the TIC118798035 system. The three planets were identified as transiting candidates from data of the TESS mission, and confirmed with ground-based photometric transit observations along with radial velocity variations obtained with FEROS, HARPS and ESPRESSO. The three planets present transit timing variations (TTVs). We performed a N-body orbital fitting to the TTVs and radial velocities finding that TIC118798035 b is as warm low-density Neptune with a mass of 0.0250$\pm$0.0023 $M_J$, a radius of 0.655$\pm$0.018 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 11.507 d; TIC118798035 c is a warm Saturn with a mass of 0.403$\pm$0.024 $M_J$, a radius of 0.973$\pm$0.023 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 22.564 d; and TIC118798035 d is a warm Jupiter with a mass of 0.773$\pm$0.052 $M_J$, a radius of 0.923$\pm$0.044 $R_J$, and an orbital period of 48.925 d. The bulk metallicities of the three planets don't fully follow the mass-metallicity correlation found for the giant planets of the solar system, which hints at a somewhat different formation history for the planets of the TIC118798035 system. TIC118798035 is the only system having more than two transiting planets larger than 0.5 $R_J$ with a precise orbital and physical characterization, amenable for future atmospheric studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An XMM long look at the accretion disk plasma in the dipping neutron star LMXB 4U1624-490</a><span class="id">[2510.19177]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dipping neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries (NS LMXBs) are systems that exhibit periodic drops in their X-ray light curves. These are believed to be caused by material at the impact point of the gas stream onto the accretion disk, the bulge. Dipping systems are observed at high inclination and provide exceptional opportunities to address important open questions about accretion disks, such as the physical properties of the bulge, and the connection between disk atmospheres and disk winds. We aimed to characterize the accretion disk plasmas present in the 21h-period NS LMXB 4U 1624-490, and perform a detailed spectral analysis of the material present at the impact region. We used four XMM EPIC pn observations that were specifically targeting dips, and allow us to probe dipping activity over different timescales (i.e. consecutive orbits and $\sim$6 months). We use both time- and flux-resolved spectroscopic analysis to probe the structural properties of the bulge moving along the line of sight and its homogeneity, respectively. During dipping, the primary spectrum is modulated by an ionized (log$\xi\sim$ 3.4) absorber with varying column density and covering factor, as well as a colder absorber. This suggests that the bulge is a multiphase and clumpy absorbing medium. From size scale arguments, we estimate the number of clumps in the bulge to be $&gt;$7$\times10^{3}$. A highly ionized disk atmosphere becomes evident only when different phases of absorption are analyzed individually. This work demonstrates the feasibility of constructing a physical picture of the bulge, and highlights how future research could reveal how its properties depend on system parameters, and whether the bulge could influence the dynamics of the accretion disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BaryonBridge: Stochastic Interpolant Model for Fast Hydrodynamical Simulations</a><span class="id">[2510.19224]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Constructing a general-purpose framework for mapping between dark matter simulations and observable hydrodynamical simulation outputs is a long-standing problem in modern astrophysics.

Most of the bubbles are created at this time. After inflation ends, the potential value of FV drops below that of TV so that these bubbles collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). By tuning the parameters of our model, we analyze the Coleman-de Luccia (CDL) and Hawking-Moss (HM) process, finding that the corresponding mass function of PBHs is sharply peaked, implying that we can realize either PBHs as cold dark matter, sub-solar PBHs, or supermassive PBHs in this scenario without enhancement of primordial curvature perturbations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19388" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anomalous scattering of pulsars towards the Gum Nebula</a><span class="id">[2510.19388]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report wideband scatter-broadening estimates of 14 pulsars towards the Gum nebula region using the Band-3 of the upgraded GMRT.

We also report a much flatter $\alpha$ for the Vela pulsar and argue that its scattering is not caused by the Gum nebula, but the Vela supernova remnant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19443" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of superradiance on the spin evolution of variably accreting massive black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.19443]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper explores how time-varying increases in mass accretion onto rapidly spinning black holes influence their long-term spin evolution when affected by superradiance - a process where energy is extracted from the black hole by a surrounding axion field. Using simulations the study tracks how sudden accretion boosts affect a critical spin-down phase (the superradiance drop) during which the black hole's spin rapidly decreases while its mass remains nearly constant. The black hole spin evolution is controlled by the competition between two processes: how fast angular momentum is added through accretion, and how fast it is removed by the axion cloud. One major conclusion is that boosts to the accretion rate before the superradiance drop have the strongest effect, as they can delay or reshape the drop and significantly shrink the region of the mass-spin plane depopulated due to the superradiance. In particular, a super-Eddington accretion rate of 5 times Eddington accretion, lasting for 4 Myr and occurring 30 Myr before the superradiance drop can reduce the superradiance exclusion region in the mass-spin plane by 40 percent. In contrast, boosts to the accretion rate after the superradiance drop only cause temporary changes in the black hole spin. The study also shows that black holes with lighter axion clouds are more sensitive to these early boosts and can show observable spin changes lasting tens to hundreds of millions of years. Heavier axion clouds, however, require much stronger or longer-lasting boosts to produce similar effects, making them more stable under variable accretion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19446" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interacting supernovae and where to find them</a><span class="id">[2510.19446]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Early interaction of supernova blast waves with CSM has the potential to accelerate particles to PeV energies, although this has not yet been detected. Current models for this interaction assume the shock expands into a smooth stellar wind, although observations of many SNe do not support this assumption. We extend previous work by considering shocks expanding into complex density profiles consisting of smooth winds with dense CSM shells at various distances from the progenitor star. We aim to predict the gamma-ray and multiwavelength signatures of CSM interaction. We used the PION code to model the CSM around LBV including a brief episode of enhanced mass-loss and to simulate the formation of photoionization-confined shells around RSGs. Consequently, we used the time-dependent acceleration-code RATPaC to study the acceleration of cosmic rays in SNe expanding into these media and to evaluate the emitted radiation across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. We find that the interaction with the CSM shells can significantly boost the gamma-ray emission, with the emission peaking weeks to years after the explosion. The peak luminosity for Type-IIP and Type-IIn remnants can exceed the luminosity expected for smooth winds by orders of magnitude. For Type-IIP explosions, the light-curve peak is only reached years after the explosion. We evaluate the multiwavelength signatures expected from the interaction of the blast wave with a dense CSM shell from radio, over optical, to thermal X-rays. We identify high-cadence optical surveys and continuous monitoring of nearby SN in radio and mm wavelengths as the best-suited strategies for identifying targets that should be followed-up by gamma-ray observatories. We predict that gamma-rays from interaction with dense CSM shells may be detectable out to a few Mpc for late interaction, and tens of Mpc for early interaction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can we ignore the time dependence in matter neutrino resonance?</a><span class="id">[2510.19485]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the vicinity of neutron star mergers (NSMs), it is possible for the neutrino self-interaction potential to cancel with the matter potential leading to matter neutrino resonance (MNR).

Previous studies have typically assumed that the neutrino flavor field evolves to a steady state – a simplification also used in other self-interaction models such as the neutrino-bulb model.

Among those X-ray absorbers, \fexxvi\ doublet structure (Ly$\alpha_1$+Ly$\alpha_2$ with $\sim 20$eV apart) has a unique potential to better probe the underlying physical nature of the wind; i.e. density and kinematics. We demonstrate, based on a physically-motivated magnetic disk wind scenario of a stratified structure in density and velocity, that the doublet line profile can be effectively utilized as a diagnostics to measure wind density and associated velocity dispersion (due to thermal turbulence and/or dynamical shear motion in winds). Our simulated doublet spectra with post-process radiative transfer calculations indicate that the profile can be (1) broad with a single peak for higher velocity dispersion ($\gsim 5,000$ km s$^{-1}$), (2) a standard shape with 1:2 canonical flux ratio for moderate dispersion ($\sim 1,000-5,000$ km s$^{-1}$) or (3) double-peaked with its flux ratio approaching 1:1 for lower velocity dispersion ($\lsim 1,000$ km s$^{-1}$) in optically-thin regime, allowing various line shape. Such a diversity in doublet profile is indeed unambiguously seen in recent observations with XRISM/Resolve at microcalorimeter resolution. We show that some implications inferred from the model will help constrain the local wind physics where \fexxvi\ is predominantly produced in a large-scale, stratified wind.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Regulated GeAs Cycles with the New $^{63}$Ga(p,$γ$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$γ$)$^{65}$As Reaction Rates and Their Impact on the GS 1826$-$24 Clocked Bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 Photospheric Radius Expansion Bursts</a><span class="id">[2510.19561]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reactions connect the ZnGa and GeAs cycles by diverting the flow of the rapid proton capture process from $^{63}$Ga to $^{65}$As. Changes in these two reaction rates regulate the ZnGa and GeAs cycles and may affect the modeled properties matching with the observed counterparts of a type I X-ray burster. We implement the latest $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates to the state-of-the-art self-consistent one-dimensional multi-zone thermo-hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to study the influence of these new reaction rates on the models of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster. Both new reaction rates obtained by Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. C 110, 065804 (2024)] are determined from complementing the experimental input with the nuclear spectroscopic information deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations. By constraining the models on reproducing the observed burst peak, light-curve profile, fluence, and recurrence time, we find that the impact of the newly measured proton thresholds and respective proton-capture reactions on the burst light-curve profile of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster is, in fact, not as significant as claimed by Zhou et al.

The former is thought to form a geometrically thin disc while the diffuse wind could form a geometrically thick hot accretion flow. In this paper, we instead consider a more generalised case, i.e., accretion with both cold and hot gas supplies, which feed a disc and a corona respectively. We investigate the interaction of disc and corona by analysing the energy coupling and matter exchange, i.e. corona condensation/disc evaporation, with a semi-analytical method. It is found that the accretion geometry in the radial direction and the resultant emission spectrum depend strongly on both the total gas supply rate and the ratio of cold and hot gases. For gas supply rates of a few percent of the Eddington value, diverse geometries and spectral shapes are possible, depending on the fraction of cold gas supply. This provides an interpretation for the various spectra observed in intermediate states. However, at higher accretion rates, regardless of the form of the feeding gas, the inner accretion flow is always disc-dominated, implying an inevitable transition to the soft state, while at very low gas supply rates, hard state spectrum dominated by the hot flow is expected. We also present the predicted hardness-intensity correlation of Cygnus X-1, and constrain the value of the viscosity parameter of the accretion flow to the range of 0.25–0.35 by comparing our results with MAXI observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revisiting the Radio Lateral Distribution Function: An amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$ and primary composition</a><span class="id">[2510.19606]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We show that there is a strong dependence of the radio LDF electric field amplitudes at ground level on the position of $X_{\rm max}$ in the atmosphere, even accounting for differences in the EM energy of the showers. Since an $X_{\rm max}$ dependence leads to a primary composition dependence, this implies that information on the mass composition is encoded not only in the LDF shape but also in its amplitude. This $X_{\rm max}$ dependence can be explained in terms of two competing scalings of the measured electric field: One goes with $(1/\rho)^J$, where $\rho$ is the air density at $X_{\rm max}$ and $J$ is a zenith dependent non-linearity factor describing coherence loss. This density scaling tends to decrease the geomagnetic emission of deeper showers. The other scaling goes with $(1/R)$, where $R$ is the distance from $X_{\rm max}$ to the core at ground, and instead increases the measured electric field of deeper showers. At low zenith angles, the $(1/R)$ scaling is stronger and leads to larger measured electric fields as $X_{\rm max}$ increases. The picture at higher zeniths, i.e., lower densities, is more nuanced. In this region, the deflections due to the Lorentz force are much larger and introduce extra time delays between the particle tracks, decreasing the coherence of the emission. This loss of coherence is highly dependent on the strength of the geomagnetic field and can slow down, or even reverse the increase of the radio emission with decreasing air density. This strong, yet historically overlooked LDF amplitude dependence on $X_{\rm max}$/composition could be used to directly infer, even bypassing any $X_{\rm max}$ reconstruction, the cosmic ray primary composition on an event-by-event basis. It could also have some repercussions on other radio reconstruction methods, such as a possible $X_{\rm max}$/composition bias on shower electromagnetic energy reconstruction methods.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Distortions in Periodicity Analysis of Blazars II: The Impact of Gaps</a><span class="id">[2510.19610]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Time series analysis is fundamental to characterizing the variability inherent in multi-wavelength emissions from blazars. However, a major observational challenge lies in the need for well-sampled, temporally uniform data, which is often hindered by irregular sampling and data gaps. These gaps can significantly affect the reliability and accuracy of methods used to probe source variability. This paper investigates the impact of such observational gaps on time series analysis of blazar emissions. To do so, we systematically evaluate how these gaps alter observed variability patterns, mask genuine periodic signals, and introduce false periodicity detections. This evaluation is conducted using both simulated and real observational data. We assess a range of widely used time series analysis methods, including the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, Phase Dispersion Minimization, and the recently proposed Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Our results demonstrate a clear and significant degradation in period detection reliability when the percentage of gaps exceeds 50\%. In such cases, the period-significance relationship becomes increasingly distorted, often leading to misleading results. Among the tested methods, SSA stands out for its ability to yield consistent and robust detections despite high data incompleteness. Additionally, the analyzed methods tend to identify artificial periodicities of around one year, likely due to seasonal sampling effects, which can result in false positives if not carefully recognized. Finally, the periods detected with $\geq$3$\sigma$ confidence are unlikely to result from stochastic processes or from the presence of gaps in the analyzed time series.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Standard Model equation of state and primordial black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.19629]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Standard Model of particle physics successfully describes all known fundamental particles and their interactions; however, it leaves several unanswered questions.

These reductions lead to an exponential enhancement in the formation rate of primordial black holes.

The universe then quickly recombined to become mostly neutral, with this state persisting until galaxies begin to reionize intergalactic gas again at $z\sim 10$. The overall Thomson scattering optical depth, $\tau$, from The Flash has been shown to be $\tau_{\rm PopIII.1}\sim0.03$, leading to a total $\tau\sim0.08-0.09$. Such a value, while significantly larger than that previously inferred from {\it Planck} observations of the low-$l$ $EE$ polarization power spectrum of the CMB, can help relieve several “tensions” faced by the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, especially the preference for negative neutrino masses and dynamic dark energy. Here we compute $EE$ power spectra of example models of The Flash. We find that, because of its very high redshift, the contribution to $l\lesssim8$ modes is dramatically reduced compared to usual low-$z$ reionization models for the same value of $\tau$, while the power at $l\gtrsim8$ is boosted. Thus the Pop III.1 reionization scenario provides a natural way to increase $\tau$, while remaining closer to the latest CMB low-$l$ polarization observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19662" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the origin of   100 TeV neutrinos from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469</a><span class="id">[2510.19662]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of TeV-PeV neutrinos detected by IceCube remains largely unknown. The most significant individual neutrino source is the close-by Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 at 4.2$\sigma$ level with a soft spectral index. Another notable candidate is the Seyfert galaxy NGC 7469, which has been recently proposed as a potential neutrino emitter. The likelihood fit of the IceCube data for this source returned a very hard spectral index of   1.9 and the excess is dominated by two high-energy events, issued as two neutrino alerts IC220424A and IC230416A. The energies of the two neutrinos are estimated to be 100-200 TeV, implying a maximum proton energy &gt; 2 PeV, significantly higher than that in NGC 1068. The lack of lower-energy neutrinos from NGC 7469 also suggests a neutrino spectrum harder than that of NGC 1068. In this paper, we analyze the Fermi-LAT observations of NGC 7469, which yield non-detection. By requiring the cascade flux accompanying neutrino production not to exceed the upper limit of the GeV flux, the size of the neutrino-emitting region can be constrained when the neutrino flux takes a high value of the allowed range. We suggest that protons are accelerated to PeV energies via turbulence or magnetic reconnection in the corona of NGC 7469 and interact with OUV photons from the accretion disk and X-rays from the corona through the $p\gamma$ process, producing neutrinos with energy of 100-200 TeV. In the turbulence acceleration scenario, the required maximum proton energy can be achieved with a magnetization parameter close to unity ($\sigma\sim 1$), while in the reconnection scenario, a magnetization parameter with $\sigma\sim 10$ is needed. In both scenarios, a pair dominated composition for the corona is preferred. The difference in the neutrino spectrum between NGC 7469 and NGC 1068 could be due to a different magnetization despite that they belong to the same type of AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19717" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Compositional characterisation of asteroid (84) Klio with JWST</a><span class="id">[2510.19717]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The analysis of the composition of primitive C$-$complex asteroids is essential to understand the distribution of volatiles in the Solar System since its formation. Primitive low-albedo families within the inner main asteroid belt are of particular interest because they are a significant source of carbonaceous near-Earth asteroids, such as Ryugu and Bennu. This study, part of the JWST SAMBA3 project (Spectral Analysis of Main Belt Asteroids in the 3 $\mu$m region), report the first spectroscopic analysis of asteroid (84) Klio in the 3 $\mu$m region, in order to better constrain its composition. We analysed the infrared (0.97$-$5.10 $\mu$m) Spectrum of Klio measured by the NIRSpec instrument on board JWST. We used the NEATM thermal model to extract the reflectance spectrum of the asteroid. Several spectral features were then analysed in the 2.8, 3.4, and 3.9 $\mu$m regions by different Gaussian fitting. The Spectrum of Klio shows an absorption band at 2.776 $\pm$ 0.001 $\mu$m that we attributed to phyllosilicates. We compared the position and shape of the feature with that observed in primitive materials such as carbonaceous chondrites and returned samples from Ryugu and Bennu. The position and shape of the 2.8 $\mu$m band, as well as the presence of a 0.7 $\mu$m band in the visible, suggest that Klio's spectrum is similar to certain CM2 meteorites. We observed an absorption band around 3.9 $\mu$m, with a depth of $0.020 \pm 0.001$ that could be attributed to carbonates. We could not clearly detect any absorption associated with organics at 3.4 $\mu$m.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19719" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The magnetic sensitivity of the Ca II resonance and subordinate lines in the solar atmosphere</a><span class="id">[2510.19719]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aims: The polarization of the Ca II resonant doublet (H and K lines) and the subordinate infrared triplet lines are key observables for diagnosing solar chromospheric magnetism. It is thus necessary to understand the physical mechanisms that shape their Stokes profiles in magnetic environments. Methods: Using the spectral synthesis module of the HanleRT-TIC code, we study the effects of anisotropic radiation pumping with partial frequency redistribution (PRD) and J-state interference (JSI) in a plane-parallel semi-empirical static solar atmospheric model. We also analyze the sensitivity of these lines to magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations, accounting for the combined action of the Hanle and Zeeman effects. Results: Including PRD is crucial to model the polarization in the core regions of the resonant lines, while JSI strongly affects their far wings. The metastable lower levels of the subordinate lines also influence the scattering polarization of the K line. With horizontal magnetic fields, the resonant lines respond to field strengths from sub-gauss to tens of gauss, whereas the infrared triplet scattering polarization is mainly sensitive to milligauss fields. At a near-limb line of sight (LOS) with $\mu = 0.1$, the Hanle effect modifies the scattering polarization via a depolarization and a rotation in the plane of linear polarization. At disk center, horizontal fields generate linear polarization in the 1D model: for the K line, the Hanle effect dominates from sub-gauss to a few tens of gauss, and the Zeeman effect dominates in stronger fields. For vertical fields, the Hanle effect vanishes, but magneto-optical effects affect the linear polarization wings. Finally, atomic level polarization impacts the outer circular polarization lobes of the resonant lines, and the weak-field approximation overestimates the LOS magnetic component in this frequency range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19729" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coupling of neutrino beam-driven MHD waves and resonant instabilities in rotating magnetoplasmas with neutrino two-flavor oscillations</a><span class="id">[2510.19729]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an analysis of neutrino-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves and instabilities in a rotating magnetoplasma with weak neutrino interactions.

Here, we employ the radiometric Bode's law (RBL) and machine learning techniques to analyze a dataset of 1330 confirmed exoplanets, aiming to estimate their potential radio emission. Permutation Importance (PI) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analyses indicate that a planet's mass, radius, orbital semi-major axis, and distance from Earth are sufficient to dependably forecast its radio flux and frequency. The random forest model accurately reproduces these radio characteristics, confirming its reliability for exoplanetary radio predictions. Considering observational constraints, we find that 64 exoplanets could generate signals detectable by the SKA, 52 of which remain observable in the intermediate AA* deployment.

The collapse of the regions of influence of clusters started at redshifts $z \approx 0.4 - 0.5$. Clusters will be virialised in $\approx 3.3$ Gyrs. Clusters in superclusters will not merge, and their present-day turnaround regions will be virialised in $\approx 10$ Gyrs. The large variety of properties of clusters suggests that they have followed different paths during evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19810" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Census of Chemically Peculiar Stars in Stellar Associations</a><span class="id">[2510.19810]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The pre-main-sequence evolution of the chemically peculiar (CP) stars on the upper main sequence is still a vast mystery and not well understood. Our analysis of young associations and open clusters aims to find (very) young CP stars to try to put a lower boundary on the age of such objects. Using three catalogues of open clusters and associations, we determined membership probabilities using HDBSCAN. The hot stars from this selection were submitted to synthetic $\Delta a$ photometry, spectral, and light curve classification to determine which ones are CP stars and candidates. Subsequently, we used spectral energy distribution fitting and emission line analysis to check for possible PMS CP stars. The results were compared to the literature. We detected 971 CP stars and candidates {in 217 clusters and associations}. A relatively large fraction, $\sim$10\% of those, show characteristics of PMS CP stars. This significantly expands the known list of candidate PMS CP stars, bringing us closer to solving the mystery of their origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</a><span class="id">[2510.17967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates. Gravitational interactions near black holes can trigger the growth of dense scalar configurations that, if sustained during inspiral, alter binary dynamics and imprint signatures on gravitational-wave signals. Detecting such effects would provide a novel probe of fundamental physics and dark matter. Here we develop a semi-analytic waveform model for binaries in scalar environments, validated against numerical relativity simulations, and apply it in a Bayesian analysis of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog. Our results set physically meaningful upper bounds on scalar environments around compact binaries. When superradiance priors are included, we find tentative evidence for such an environment in GW190728 with $\ln B_{\mathrm{vac}}^{\mathrm{env}} \approx 3.5$, which would correspond to the existence of a light scalar field with mass $\sim 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axion Production and Detection Using a Dual NMR-type Experiment</a><span class="id">[2510.18944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axions that couple to nuclear spins via the axial current interaction can be both produced and detected using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. In this scheme, nuclei driven by a real oscillating magnetic field in one device act as an axion source, which can drive NMR in a nearby spin-polarized sample interrogated with a sensitive magnetometer. We study the prospects for detecting axions through this method and identify two key characteristics that result in compelling detection sensitivity. First, the gradient of the generated axion field can be substantial, set by the inverse distance from the source. In the near zone, it reduces to the inverse of the source's geometric size. Second, because the generated axion field is produced at a known frequency, the detection medium can be tuned precisely to this frequency, enabling long interrogation times. We show that the experimental sensitivity of a pair of centimeter-scale NMR devices operating over a 15-day integration time can already surpass existing astrophysical bounds on the axion-nucleon coupling. A similar sensitivity can be achieved with 10 centimeter-scale NMR devices with only 1 hour of integration time. These dual NMR configurations are capable of probing a wide range of axion masses, up to values comparable to the inverse distance between the source and the sensor.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity forecasts for gravitational-wave detectors to dark matter decaying into gravitons</a><span class="id">[2510.18958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter may not be perfectly stable, and its decay could generate distinctive gravitational-wave signatures.

We investigate the impact of the $n=2$ Hu-Sawicki model on the late-time growth of structures. We find that updated late-time growth of structure data imposes $|f_{R_0}|\lesssim10^{-6}-10^{-5}$ and thus conclude that the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model contributes no significant phenomenology at both background and perturbative level beyond the effective cosmological constant encompassed in its definition. This conclusion points to the survival of the present tension between early and late measurements of $\sigma_8$, as the Hu-Sawicki model can only worsen this issue or at best reproduce the results from the current concordance cosmological model. The generalized perturbative method showcased in this work can be applied to more elaborate $f(R)$ models to isolate genuine higher-order signatures beyond the quasistatic approximation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19699" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Effects of Dynamical Capture on two equal-mass non-spinning black holes</a><span class="id">[2510.19699]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dynamical captures of black holes are unique events that provide an exceptional opportunity to probe the strong-field regime of gravitational physics. In this article, we perform numerical relativity simulations to study the events of dynamical capture of two equal-mass non-spinning black holes. We consider a suite of scenarios within a range of initial linear momenta ($p/M=0.095-0.75$) and incidence angles ($\theta=6.36^\circ-2.83^\circ$), and study the emitted Weyl scalar ($\Psi_4$) of each case, as well as the spins and masses of the black holes before and after they merge. We provide a simple analytical model which accurately fits the gravitational-wave emission. We study the dependence of the time-interval between the capture and the merger emissions with respect to the incidence angle, which can be well parametrized by a first-order divergent behavior, allowing to find the angle that separates a scattering event from a dynamical capture. We also find that, in general, the parameters that model the first emission can be well described by linear or exponentially decaying functions in terms of the incidence angle, while others display more complex behaviors that offer valuable insights into the nature of these events.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11813" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forcing Planets to Evolve: Interactions Between Uranus and Neptune at Late Stages of Dynamical Evolution</a><span class="id">[2410.11813]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In early Solar System numerical simulations, where chaos is a primary driver, it is difficult to explore parameter space in a systematic way. In such simulations, stable configurations are hard to come by, and often require special fine-tuning. In addition, it is infeasible to run suites of well-resolved, realistic simulations with a disk of massive particles to drive planetary evolution where enough particles remain to represent the transneptunian populations to robustly statistically compare with observations. To complement state of the art full N-body simulations, we develop a method to artificially control each planet's orbital elements independently from each other, which when carefully applied, can be used to test a wider suite of models. We modify two widely used publicly available N-body integrators: (1) the C code, \texttt{REBOUND} and (2) the FORTRAN code, \texttt{Mercury6.2}. We show how the application of specific fictitious forces within numerical integrators can be used to tightly control planetary evolution to more easily explore migration and orbital excitation and damping. This tool allows us to replicate the impact a massive planetesimal disk would have on the planets, without actually including the massive planetesimals, thus decreasing the chaos and simulation runtime. We demonstrate the utility of this tool by applying it to the coupled orbital evolution of Uranus and Neptune, and show that Neptune's eccentricity damping and radial outward migration have the appropriate affect on Uranus' eccentricity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05087" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospects for Observing Astrophysical Transients with GeV Neutrinos</a><span class="id">[2412.05087]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although Cherenkov detectors of high-energy neutrinos in ice and water are often optimized to detect TeV-PeV neutrinos, they may also be sensitive to transient neutrino sources in the 1-100 GeV energy range.

Characterizing these morphologies and spectro-temporal properties is a key strategy in investigating the underlying unknown emission mechanism of FRBs. This type of analysis has been typically accomplished using two-dimensional Gaussian techniques and the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the waterfall. These techniques are effective and precise at all duration scales, but can be limited in the presence of scattered tails, complex morphologies, or recently observed microshot forests. Here, we present a technique that involves the tagging of per-channel arrival times of an FRB to perform spectro-temporal measurements using a Gaussian profile model for each channel. While scattering and dispersion remain important and often dominating sources of uncertainty in measurements, this technique provides an adaptable and firm foundation for obtaining spectro-temporal properties from all types of FRB morphologies. We present measurements using this technique of several hundred bursts across 12 repeating sources, including over 400 bursts from the repeating sources FRB 20121102A, FRB 20220912A, and FRB 20200120E, all of which exhibit recently observed microsecond-long ultra-FRBs, as well as 143 multi-component drift rates. In addition to retrieving the known relationship between sub-burst slope and duration, we explore other correlations between burst properties. We find that the sub-burst slope law extends smoothly to ultra-FRBs, and that ultra-FRBs appear to form a distinct population in the duration-frequency relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FIP Bias Evolution in an Emerging Active Region as observed in SPICE Synoptic Observations</a><span class="id">[2502.12045]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the time evolution of relative elemental abundances in the context of the first ionization potential effect focusing on an active region.

Leveraging spectroscopic observations from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument on board Solar Orbiter, we use extreme ultraviolet lines from ions formed across a broad temperature range–from the upper chromosphere to the low corona–and we perform relative abundance ratios following differential emission measure analysis. This methodology yields relative abundance maps from low, intermediate, and high first ionization potential elements. We obtain the temporal evolution of a number of abundance ratios for different structures on the Sun. We compare these results with the outcomes of the ponderomotive force model. We find good correlation between the model and our results, suggesting an Alfvén-wave driven fractionation of the plasma. Fan loops, loop footpoints and active region boundaries exhibit coronal abundances, while the active region core shows more photospheric-like composition. A slow and steady increase in the magnesium to neon relative first ionization potential bias values is observed, starting around 1.5 and increasing by about 50\% after two days. The sulfur to oxygen evolution coupled with the model brings evidence of resonant waves fractionating the plasma in transition region structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial black holes with mass ratio-modulated initial clustering: merger suppression and projected constraints</a><span class="id">[2506.06648]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a modification of the expected local primordial black hole (PBH) count $N(y)$, typically seen in the context of the early PBH binary merger rate as a term in the merger rate suppression.

We then examine how this change affects the projected constraints on PBH abundance from simulated Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA mergers. Our results indicate that for broadly extended mass distributions, the merger suppression is greatly reduced for binaries with $q \gg 1$. This leads to an enhanced merger rate for binary distributions favoring a lighter average mass. This change is best reflected by an extension of the low mass end of the constraint windows derived from the resolvable merger channel, although this result is present as well in the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) constraints. Our results imply that the assumption of PBH clustering is testable at abundances and mass ranges much lower than anticipated, although more work must be done to explore how high mass ratio PBH binaries actually evolve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19041" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Evolution of Jupiter and Saturn as a function of the Parameter R$_ρ$</a><span class="id">[2506.19041]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Computed using the APPLE planetary evolution code, we present updated evolutionary models for Jupiter and Saturn that incorporate helium rain, non-adiabatic thermal structures, and &quot;fuzzy&quot; extended heavy-element cores.

For both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct models spanning from $R_{\rho}=1$ (Ledoux) to $R_{\rho}=0$ (Schwarzschild), and identify best-fit solutions that match each planet's effective temperature, equatorial radius, lower-order gravitational moments, and atmospheric composition at 4.56 Gyr. We find that lower $R_{\rho}$ values lead to stronger convective mixing, resulting in higher surface metallicities and lower deep interior temperatures, while requiring reduced heavy-element masses and lower initial entropies to stabilize the dilute inner cores. Our Saturn models also broadly agree with the observed brunt frequency profile inferred from Cassini ring seismology, with stable layers arising from both the helium rain region and the dilute core.

We employ a single-fluid framework in which DM interacts with ordinary matter (OM) via the Higgs portal and remains in thermal equilibrium through non-gravitational interactions. Using a quasi-static approximation, we analyze the evolution of PNSs during the Kelvin-Helmholtz phase by varying the DM mass while keeping the entropy per baryon and lepton fraction fixed. Our results show that DM absorbs thermal energy from the stellar medium without efficient re-emission, thereby altering neutrino emission and affecting the star's thermal evolution history. Furthermore, neutrinos contribute significantly to pressure support in the PNS phase, inhibiting DM mass accretion during neutrino-trapped stages. Based on the requirement to satisfy the observed $2,\rm M_\odot$ neutron star mass constraint and to maintain consistency with supernova remnant data, we suggest an upper limit of $m_\chi \leq 0.62,\rm GeV$ for the DM mass that can accrete in evolving PNSs, within the model framework. In contrast, we established that cold neutron stars (NSs) can support higher DM masses without compromising equilibrium stability, owing to increased central density, enhanced gravitational binding energy, and reduced thermal pressure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">50.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bimetric gravity improves the fit to DESI BAO and eases the Hubble tension</a><span class="id">[2507.03743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate whether the latest combination of DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data (Planck 2018 + ACT), and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) compilations (Pantheon+, Union3, and DES Y5) favor a dynamical dark energy component, and explore if such a scenario can simultaneously help resolve the Hubble tension.

With the advent of new radio, optical, and infrared sky surveys, it became possible to carry out additional studies of the 113 radio sources observed within this program using the 6-meter BTA telescope. Morphological features indicative of the evolutionary state of radio sources revealed that 9 objects exhibit signs of restarted activity, 12 can be classified as young, and 2 as dying. Based on their WAT/NAT and WRS morphologies, 24 sources are likely located within galaxy groups or clusters, or show evidence of jet reorientation. Additionally, four objects in the sample represent pairs of radio sources whose host galaxies are separated by only a few tens of kiloparsecs. Continuum spectra were constructed, and variability indices were calculated. A high proportion of sources with a variability index ($V&gt;3$) is attributed to significant differences in angular resolution between the TXS and VCSS surveys, as well as to underestimated flux densities for certain double-lobed sources. A comparison of spectral indices derived from older and newer data indicates a decrease in the number of steep-spectrum sources in the sample. This reduction is most likely due to improved characterization of the low-frequency portion of the continuum spectra following the incorporation of GLEAM data. However, for some radio sources, the observed spectral changes may reflect internal evolution, that observed in a shift of the spectral peak or a roll-off in the radio spectrum towards lower frequencies, as evidenced by flux density measurements from various catalogues covering a period of up to forty years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20904" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clustering of DESI galaxies split by thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</a><span class="id">[2508.20904]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect is associated with galaxy clusters - extremely large and dense structures tracing the dark matter with a higher bias than isolated galaxies. We propose to use the tSZ data to separate galaxies from redshift surveys into distinct subpopulations corresponding to different densities and biases independently of the redshift survey systematics. Leveraging the information from different environments, as in density-split and density-marked clustering, is known to tighten the constraints on cosmological parameters, like $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and neutrino mass. We use data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in their region of overlap to demonstrate informative tSZ splitting of Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs). We discover a significant increase in the large-scale clustering of DESI LRGs corresponding to detections starting from 1-2 sigma in the ACT DR6 + Planck tSZ Compton-$y$ map, below the cluster candidate threshold (4 sigma). We also find that such galaxies have higher line-of-sight coordinate (and velocity) dispersions and a higher number of close neighbors than both the full sample and near-zero tSZ regions. We produce simple simulations of tSZ maps that are intrinsically consistent with galaxy catalogs and do not include systematic effects, and find a similar pattern of large-scale clustering enhancement with tSZ effect significance. Moreover, we observe that this relative bias pattern remains largely unchanged with variations in the galaxy-halo connection model in our simulations. This is promising for future cosmological inference from tSZ-split clustering with semi-analytical models. Thus, we demonstrate that valuable cosmological information is present in the lower signal-to-noise regions of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich map, extending far beyond the individual cluster candidates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21275" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One-Loop Nonlinear Matter Power Spectrum from Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory: Fast Computation and Comparison with Emulators</a><span class="id">[2508.21275]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a fast and accurate formulation for computing the nonlinear matter power spectrum at one-loop order based on Unified Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (ULPT). ULPT decomposes the density field into the Jacobian deviation, capturing intrinsic nonlinear growth, and the displacement-mapping factor, accounting for large-scale distortions due to bulk flows. This structural separation leads to a natural division of the power spectrum into a source term and a displacement-mapping factor, ensuring infrared (IR) safety by construction. We implement an efficient numerical algorithm using FFTLog and FAST-PT, achieving approximately 2-second evaluations on a standard laptop. The results are validated against simulation-based emulators, including the Dark Emulator and Euclid Emulator 2. Across 100 sampled cosmologies, ULPT agrees with emulator predictions at the 2–3\% level up to \( k \simeq 0.4\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} \) for \( z \geq 0.5 \), without any nuisance parameters. Similar agreement is found in configuration space, where the two-point correlation function remains accurate down to \( r \simeq 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc} \). Compared to standard perturbation theory, which fails at small scales due to series expansion of the displacement factor, ULPT maintains convergence by preserving its full exponential form. We also clarify the mechanism of BAO damping: exponential suppression by displacement and peak sharpening by nonlinear growth. The combination accurately reproduces BAO features seen in simulations. ULPT thus offers a robust, IR-safe, and computationally efficient framework for modeling large-scale structure in galaxy surveys.

In this approach, the biased density fluctuation is built solely from Galileon-type operators associated with the intrinsic nonlinear growth of dark matter. This ensures the bias expansion is well defined at the field level, automatically satisfies statistical conditions of vanishing ensemble and volume averages, and removes the need for ad hoc renormalization. We derive analytic one-loop expressions for the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter power spectra and implement an efficient numerical algorithm using \texttt{FFTLog} and \texttt{FAST-PT}, enabling rapid and accurate evaluation. The model requires only a minimal set of bias parameters: three parameters are sufficient to describe correlation functions in configuration space, while four parameters are needed for power spectra in Fourier space. To test accuracy, we jointly fit halo auto- and cross-spectra from the \textit{Dark Emulator}, covering nine redshift-mass combinations with 100 cosmologies each. A single set of bias parameters reproduces both spectra within $\sim1\%$ up to $k \simeq 0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for typical linear bias $b_1 \sim 0.8$-2, and to $k \simeq 0.2\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ for $b_1 \sim 3$. The same parameters also match two-point correlation functions down to $r \simeq 15\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$. Moreover, ULPT predicts the relation $b_{K^2}^{\mathrm{E}} = -\tfrac{3}{4} b_2^{\mathrm{E}}$, validated against $N$-body results.

One of the primary challenges has been the necessity for prolonged exposures in the $\gamma$-ray energy band. In our investigation, we leverage 12 years' worth of observations from the \textit{Fermi}-LAT to systematically explore periodicity across 1492 jetted AGN cataloged in 4FGL, representing the largest sample analyzed to date. Our analysis involves a robust pipeline employing nine distinct techniques designed to detect potential periodic emissions within their $\gamma$ rays. We note that 24 objects with previous hints of periodicity are deliberately excluded in the present work since they were reanalyzed in a dedicated paper using a similar methodology. Using this thorough approach, we do not find any evidence for periodic signals in the 1492 jetted AGN $\gamma$-ray light curves analyzed here.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Re-accretion of Giant Impact Ejecta Can Drive Significant Atmospheric Erosion on Terrestrial Planets</a><span class="id">[2509.22785]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant impacts, the collisions between planetary embryos, play a crucial role in sculpting the planets and their orbital architectures. Numerical simulations have advanced our understanding of these events, enabling estimations of mass and atmospheric loss during the primary impacts. However, high computational costs have restricted investigations to the immediate aftermath, limiting our understanding of the longer-term consequences. In this study, we investigate the effect of re-accretion of giant impact debris, a process previously overlooked, on the atmospheres of terrestrial planets. Following the collisional and dynamical evolution of the debris ejected during the primary impacts, we quantify the amount of debris that would be re-accreted by the progenitor. We find that $\sim 0.003\ M_{\oplus}$ would be re-accreted over a wide range of Earth-like planet properties, assuming $1\%$ of their mass is ejected as non-vaporised debris. Over a prolonged period, the secondary impacts during re-accretion drive enhanced atmospheric loss. Notably, the impacts from the debris of the canonical Moon-forming impact would have gradually eroded an atmosphere similar to present-day Earth's in $\sim 30$ Myr. More generally, any planet growing via giant impacts within $2$ au is likely to experience significant post-impact atmospheric erosion unless the initial atmosphere was at least $5$ times more massive than Earth's. Our results highlight the crucial role secondary impacts from giant-impact ejecta could have in driving the long-term atmospheric evolution of Earth-like planets, and demonstrate that giant impacts can be significantly more effective at eroding such atmospheres than previously thought, when re-accretion of debris is considered.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25877" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A fast powerful X-ray transient from possible tidal disruption of a white dwarf</a><span class="id">[2509.25877]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stars captured by black holes (BHs) can be torn apart by strong tidal forces, producing electromagnetic flares. To date, more than 100 tidal disruption events (TDEs) have been observed, each involving invariably normal gaseous stars whose debris falls onto the BH, sustaining the flares over years. White dwarfs (WDs), which are the most prevalent compact stars and a million times denser–and therefore tougher–than gaseous stars, can only be disrupted by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) of 10^2–10^5 solar masses. WD-TDEs are considered to generate more powerful and short-lived flares, but their evidence has been lacking. Here we report observations of a fast and luminous X-ray transient EP250702a detected by Einstein Probe. Its one-day-long X-ray peak as luminous as 10^(47-49) erg/s showed strong recurrent flares with hard spectra extending to several tens of MeV gamma-rays, as detected by Fermi/GBM and Konus-Wind, indicating relativistic jet emission. The jet's X-ray dropped sharply from 3 x 10^49 erg/s to around 10^44 erg/s within 20 days (10 days in the source rest frame). These characteristics are inconsistent with any known transient phenomena other than a jetted-TDE evolving over an unprecedentedly short timescale, indicating the disruption of a WD by an IMBH. At late times, a new soft component progressively dominates the X-ray spectrum, exhibiting an extreme super-Eddington luminosity, which possibly originates from an accretion disc. WD-TDEs open a new window for investigating the elusive IMBHs and their surrounding stellar environments, and they are prime sources of gravitational waves in the band of space-based interferometers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Revealing evolution of Dark Energy density from observations</a><span class="id">[2510.12881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a model–independent reconstruction of the normalized dark energy density function, $X(z) \equiv \rho_{\mathrm{de}}(z)/\rho_{\mathrm{de}}(0)$, derived directly from the DES-SN5YR Type Ia supernova sample. The analysis employs an inversion formalism that relates the derivative of the distance modulus, $\mu^{\prime}(z)$, to the expansion history, allowing the data to determine the shape of $X(z)$ without assuming a specific equation–of–state or dark energy density parameterization. A statistically optimized binning of the supernova sample (using 17 intervals following the Freedman–Diaconis criterion and 34 following Scott's rule) ensures a stable estimation of $\mu^{\prime}(z)$ and a controlled propagation of uncertainties throughout the inversion process. The resulting $X(z)$ remains statistically consistent with a constant value within one standard deviation across the entire redshift range, showing no significant evidence for an evolving dark energy component at present. In a direct comparison among $\Lambda$CDM, CPL, and the quadratic $X^2(z)$ parameterization – where CPL and $X^2(z)$ each introduce two additional free parameters relative to $\Lambda$CDM – the CPL model attains the best statistical agreement with the data, albeit only marginally and strictly within this restricted model set. These outcomes indicate that current observations are compatible with an almost constant dark energy density ($w \simeq -1$), while the inversion framework remains sensitive to subtle departures that forthcoming high–precision surveys could resolve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">84 Second and 169 Second Rotation of Two Isolated, Ultramassive, Strongly Magnetic White Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.18044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photometric variability in massive, magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) on the timescales of less than a few hours is oft interpreted as being due to magnetic spots on the surface of a rotating star. Increasingly, numbers of these short period variables are being discovered with the continued growth of time-domain astronomy, testing theories of magnetic white dwarf formation and angular momentum evolution. We present the detection of extremely rapid rotation in the WDs SDSS J1557+0411 and PG 1312+099, with periods of 168.94 s and 83.72 s, respectively. We consider other possible causes of the monoperiodic photometric variability, including binarity (eclipses and ellipsoidal variations) and asteroseismic pulsations. Though these cannot be ruled out with the existing data, these alternative explanations seem unlikely. SDSS J1557+0411 was predicted to be a rapidly rotating oxygen-neon core WD by Camisassa et al. (2022), a prediction borne out at least in part by our observations. PG 1312+099 was previously observed via polarimetry to be rotating with a period of  5.4 h; we propose that this object may be an unresolved double degenerate system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</a><span class="id">[2407.07956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniqueness of gravitational constant at low energies from the connection between spin-2 and spin-0 sectors</a><span class="id">[2410.01449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fact that graviton propagator contains not only one but two tensorial components excludes a unique definition of the running behavior of the gravitational constant, while at low energies gravitation is characterized solely by Newton's constant. How these two facts are reconciled when massive quantum fields are present remains unanswered. In this work, by non-minimally coupling gravity to a one-loop massive scalar, we show that this potential conflict is resolved by the non-trivial equivalence between the residues of the two propagator components. Such equivalence, crucial for the validity of the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem, is based on a rather subtle connection between the spin-2 and spin-0 sectors of the propagator. It is verified that this connection also makes the two quantum-corrected gravitational potentials be characterized by the same gravitational constant at large distances. In addition, we find that the potentials in our case as well as the quantum-corrected Coulomb potential can be expressed concisely in a unified formulation. By comparing these results with experiments, we establish a new upper bound on the magnitude of the non-minimal coupling parameter $\xi$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22465" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological Origin of the KM3-230213A event and associated Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2503.22465]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a novel cosmological scenario to explain the exceptional KM3-230213A neutrino event reported at an energy scale of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ PeV by the KM3NeT collaboration, along with its associated gravitational wave (GW) signatures. In our framework, ultra high energy neutrinos originate from the decay of a super-heavy sterile neutrino produced via the Hawking evaporation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the early Universe. Employing an ultraviolet complete type-I seesaw model, we demonstrate that while two sterile neutrinos are responsible for light neutrino masses as required by oscillation data, one sterile neutrino can have an exceedingly feeble coupling, allowing its lifetime to be tuned so that its decay yields a neutrino flux consistent with the observed event. Furthermore, our scenario predicts two distinct GW signatures: one arising from gravitons emitted during PBH evaporation and another from the Bremsstrahlung process during the decay of the sterile neutrino. These complementary signals provide a multi-messenger probe of the underlying physics. Our results thus offer a compelling explanation for the KM3-230213A event and open new avenues for investigating the interplay between high-energy neutrino astronomy and gravitational wave cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational waves from eccentric binary neutron star mergers: Systematic biases and inadequacy of quasicircular templates</a><span class="id">[2504.18622]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The use of quasicircular waveforms in matched-filter analyses of signals from eccentric binary neutron star mergers can lead to biases in the source's parameter estimation. We demonstrate that significant biases can be present already for moderate eccentricities $e_{0} \gtrsim 0.05$ and signals detected by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with signal-to-noise ratio $\gtrsim 12$. We perform systematic Bayesian mock analyses of unequal-mass nonspinning binary neutron star signals up to eccentricities $e_0 \sim 0.1$ using quasicircular effective-one-body waveforms with spins. We find fractional signal-to-noise ratio losses up to tens of percent and up to 16$\sigma$ deviations in the inference of the chirp mass. The latter effect is sufficiently large to lead to an incorrect (and ambiguous) source identification. The inclusion of spin precession in the quasicircular waveform does not capture eccentricity effects. We conclude that high-precision observations with advanced (and next generation) detectors are likely to require standardized, accurate, and fast eccentric waveforms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19135" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for high energy 5.5 MeV solar axions with the complete Borexino dataset</a><span class="id">[2504.19135]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A search for solar axions and axion-like particles produced in the $p+d\rightarrow\rm{^3He}+A~(5.5\rm{ ~MeV})$ reaction was performed using the complete dataset of the Borexino detector (3995 days of measurement live-time).

This clearly decouples early-universe annihilation from late-time halo dynamics. A detailed numerical analysis identified a narrow predictive island of viability. A representative benchmark with $m_\chi\!=\!600$ GeV, $m_\phi\!=\!15$ MeV, and $m_{\Phi_h}\!\simeq\!1.2$ TeV reproduces the relic density and yields $\sigma_T/m_\chi\sim 0.1$–$1~\mathrm{cm}^2\!/\mathrm{g}$ at dwarf-galaxy velocities while satisfying cluster bounds.

This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields.
