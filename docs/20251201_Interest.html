<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21715" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DNNs, Dataset Statistics, and Correlation Functions</a><span class="id">[2511.21715]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper argues that dataset structure is important in image recognition tasks (among other tasks). Specifically, we focus on the nature and genesis of correlational structure in the actual datasets upon which DNNs are trained. We argue that DNNs are implementing a widespread methodology in condensed matter physics and materials science that focuses on mesoscale correlation structures that live between fundamental atomic/molecular scales and continuum scales. Specifically, we argue that DNNs that are successful in image classification must be discovering high order correlation functions. It is well-known that DNNs successfully generalize in apparent contravention of standard statistical learning theory. We consider the implications of our discussion for this puzzle.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Einstein's 1935 Letters to Schrödinger and Popper and the Boundaries of the PBR $ψ$-Epistemic Framework</a><span class="id">[2511.23125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Einstein's 1935 critique of quantum mechanics is often associated with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument, yet his private correspondence from that year reveals a more exact conceptual structure guiding his claim that the $\psi$-function is incomplete. This paper reconstructs Einstein's reasoning in his letters to Schrödinger and Popper and examines how it engages, and fails to engage with contemporary $\psi$-ontic/$\psi$-epistemic distinctions. Recent scholarship, most notably by Ben-Menahem, has interpreted Einstein as an early representative of the modern $\psi$-epistemic tradition within the Harrigan-Spekkens ontological models framework and the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem. I argue, however, that this retrospective classification is undermined by Ben-Menahem's own distinction between realist and radical epistemic interpretations: Einstein's 1935 view lacks the structural assumptions - defined ontic state space, preparation distributions, and overlap structure - required for membership in the HS/PBR class of $\psi$-epistemic models. Any such identification, therefore, requires importing formal machinery foreign to Einstein's original argument.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07015" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Geometric View of Theories</a><span class="id">[2511.07015]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent critiques of the semantic conception of scientific theories suggest that a theory is not best formulated as a collection of models satisfying some set of kinematical or dynamical conditions. Thus it has been argued that additional structure on the set of models is required. Furthermore, there are calls for developing a 'theory of theories', where what was formerly a 'theory' is seen as a 'model' within a larger theoretical structure. This paper makes a two-pronged proposal for the ”shape” that physical theories should take, based on recent insights on dualities and quasi-dualities in physics. First, I develop a geometric view of theories, according to which a physical theory is a set of models with topological and geometric structure on it. This general view is briefly illustrated in an example from quantum cosmology. Second, I make a more specific proposal for a natural structure that can encompass various 'theories' as its models, with topological and algebraic-geometric structure on them. I call the latter more specific structure a 'model bundle', where the models are in the fibres and there is a moduli space in the base. I illustrate my second proposal in an example from quantum field theory. This view highlights the important role of quasi-dualities as local transition functions between fibres; dualities are recovered as global transition functions when the bundle is trivial. I discuss some philosophical issues that this geometric view of physical theories opens up, such as its realist interpretation.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21884" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Null Results, Real Learning: Geomagnetic Response to an X1.8 Solar Flare with Research-Grade and Smartphone Magnetometers in a Citizen-Science Classroom Activity</a><span class="id">[2511.21884]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Introductory college Earth and space science courses offer rich opportunities for citizen science projects. One especially compelling context is Earth's geomagnetic field: a self-excited dynamo in the liquid outer core generates a global field that couples Earth's interior to solar forcing, providing a natural laboratory for space weather education. We tested the viability of smartphone magnetometers for quantitative monitoring during the 4 November 2025 X1.8 solar flare, linking planetary magnetism, space weather, and authentic undergraduate research. Co-located observations were obtained with a Geometrics G-857 proton-precession magnetometer and tri-axial smartphone sensors logging via Physics Toolbox in a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) emphasizing the Nature of Science (NOS). Fourteen one-minute paired averages spanning 17:27-17:40 UT revealed a systematic smartphone bias of about 630 nT (95% confidence interval 550-710 nT) relative to the G-857 and a weak negative correlation (r   -0.4). Smartphone magnetometers thus lack the precision and calibration stability needed for nanotesla-scale flare signatures but remain valuable as pedagogical and engagement tools. We frame smartphones within a tiered instrumentation ladder linking research-grade observatories, intermediate-cost community magnetometers (for example, HamSCI Personal Space Weather Stations), and smartphones as high-engagement entry points to geomagnetic and space weather studies. This hierarchy aligns citizen science with open data protocols and NOS pedagogy, transforming low-cost sensing into epistemically grounded inquiry suitable for introductory college laboratories.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Megastructures of type-III civilizations orbiting galaxies</a><span class="id">[2511.22748]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The article discusses the possibility of a Type-III extraterrestrial civilization constructing megastructures around a galaxy in regions where the galactic radiation becomes indistinguishable from the CMB radiation. For a Milky Way-like galaxy, we estimated the corresponding distance from its center at which a solar mass megastructure would need to be placed. We also showed that, from an energetic standpoint, placing such a massive object into orbit poses no fundamental difficulties. The detectability of the megastructure was also addressed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23108" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experimental study of argon gas breakdown with symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations</a><span class="id">[2511.23108]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Paschen law relates the breakdown voltage of a gas to the product of gas pressure and inter-electrode distance, predicting a characteristic minimum voltage at a specific pd value. In this study, the role of electrode configurations (symmetric and asymmetric) and inter-electrode spacing on the gas breakdown processes (or Paschen Law) is examined. Numerous sets of experiments are performed with both symmetric and asymmetric electrode configurations of different sizes to obtain Paschen curves at different inter-electrode distances. The experimentally obtained Paschen's curves for different electrode configurations are fitted using a proposed modified empirical relation for breakdown voltage, incorporating variable power-law dependencies and fitting parameters to better capture the observed deviations. Upon closer inspection, we observed that the breakdown voltage and the corresponding pd value are influenced by both electrode configurations and the inter-electrode discharge gap. The variation in breakdown voltage and pd minima for different electrode configurations is explained by analyzing the electric field distributions between the electrodes (cathode and anode) for an applied voltage.</p></div></details></article></body>
