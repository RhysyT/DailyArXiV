<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11349" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relative Information, Relative Facts</a><span class="id">[2510.11349]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We offer a fresh perspective on the relational interpretation of quantum mechanics as a way of thinking about the world described by quantum theory based on quantifiable notions of information. This allows us to provide a definition of a relative fact, with no addition to orthodox quantum theory and no fundamentally special role for observers. By associating perspectives with commutative observables rather than entire quantum systems, several previous problems with the interpretation are dissolved. As a side result, we show how a quantum measurement, properly described, is a continuous process.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">French on London and Bauer, and QBism</a><span class="id">[2510.11544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this article I compare two interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) that draw inspiration from phenomenology: the London-Bauer-French interpretation (hereafter LBF) as articulated by Steven French, and QBism. I give special attention to certain disagreements between QBism and LBF identified French's work, as well as French's related claims that QBism may be at odds with key ideas in phenomenology. My main finding is that QBism does not fare so badly with phenomenology as French makes out; in particular it can be made compatible with Zahavi's correlationism and Husserl's notion of intersubjectivity, both of which strongly inform LBF. Nevertheless, I concur with French's argument that QBism is incompatible with the conception of quantum measurement in LBF, hence also with that of Merleau-Ponty, as the latter based his own analysis on that of London and Bauer. I explain why I find QBism's account preferable in this case.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02825" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prigogine's temporalization of physics: two agnostic attitudes of physicists</a><span class="id">[2502.02825]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper, I aim to clarify the unconscious ideologies and attitudes held by physicists through Prigogine's work. Prigogine was an outstanding chemist and physicist who made significant contributions to the development of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. At the same time, he extended his ideas beyond physics into the humanities, engaging in an interdisciplinary exploration of scientific and philosophical thought. Due to his unique career, Prigogine's reception has been deeply divided. This study highlights his intellectual endeavors to formulate two distinct agnostic attitudes – one held by dynamicists and the other by Prigogine himself. Building on this formulation, I examine how physics has been spatialized, drawing on the philosophy of Bergson. Finally, I explore an alternative path that Prigogine might have envisioned – the temporalization of physics – in a broader context to extend and revitalize his philosophy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is emergence, after all?</a><span class="id">[2507.04951]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Science ouverte et collaborative pour l'élaboration d'un banc automatisé de caractérisation de pertes en commutation par opposition</a><span class="id">[2510.09725]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The switching losses of power transistors are generally measured using the so-called double pulse method. Measuring the opposition of two switching cells is a complementary method that is more accurate but indirect. However, implementing this method can be more complex and requires calibration steps and comprehensive control, with the added issue of thermal management. In this context, we proposed to address this topic through open and collaborative science, first in the form of a two-day hackathon, followed by monthly open sessions. More than 20 participants contributed to the two-day hackathon, followed by monthly sessions for those wishing to continue working together. This enabled us to set up an automated bench, in open science, including the generation of switching commands, the configuration and control of measuring instruments, and the hardware part. Here we present and share our work and this open approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dry ice baths as liquid nitrogen substitutes for physics demonstrations</a><span class="id">[2510.09971]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Liquid nitrogen (LN2) is a long-time favorite for physics demonstrations, with a large repertoire of crowd-pleasing experiments that are cornerstones in outreach efforts. While R1 universities usually have a ready LN2 supply for their Physics, Chemistry, and Biology departments, K-12 and two-year college teachers often have to go to specialty suppliers to obtain LN2, and also need access to expensive storage equipment. Dry ice (solid CO2) is available at many super markets, and as such its suitability as a substitute for LN2 was explored, with the results discussed below. At 77K (-196°C) LN2 is considerably colder than dry ice at 195K (-78.5°C), however some demonstrations are still viable.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09720" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NotebookLM as a Socratic physics tutor: Design and preliminary observations of a RAG-based tool</a><span class="id">[2504.09720]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study explores NotebookLM, a Google Gemini - powered AI platform that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a Socratic tutor for physics education. In this implementation, NotebookLM was configured to support students in solving conceptually oriented physics problems through a guided, questioning-based dialogue. When deployed as a collaborative tutor, the system restricts student interaction to a chat-only interface, promoting controlled and guided engagement. By grounding its responses in teacher-provided source documents, the AI tutor helps mitigate one of the major shortcomings of standard Large Language Models - hallucinations - thereby ensuring more traceable and reliable answers. This work details the methodological design of the tutor, including the iterative development of a pedagogical &quot;Training Manual&quot;, and presents preliminary qualitative observations from demonstrations with pre-service and in-service teachers. These observations highlight both the promising potential of the tool and key pedagogical challenges, such as managing user motivation. While limitations remain, this work offers a promising and replicable model for educators seeking to implement grounded AI tutors in their own teaching contexts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</a><span class="id">[2509.11997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's and other public communities' perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</p></div></details></article>
