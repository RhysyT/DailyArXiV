Raman's Exploration in Optics – A Spectrum of History</a><span class="id">[2602.18334]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>C.V. Raman (1888-1970) was one of the pioneering scientists to have emerged from India during the colonial era. His scientific explorations were driven by his curiosity to understand wave phenomena. Naturally, optics and related physical effects were at the heart of such an exploration. Apart from his Nobel prize-winning discovery of the Raman effect, his research included topics such as oblique diffraction, light scattering from liquids and amorphous solids, classical and quantum nature of light, acousto-optics, haloes and coronae (speckles), crystal dynamics and soft modes, optics of minerals, floral colors, physiology of vision and many other aspects related to light in natural settings. In this article, I give a historical overview of some of the work by C.V. Raman and his group that had a direct connection to optics and optical spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18115" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Emergence of Measured Geometry in Self-Gravitating Systems</a><span class="id">[2602.18115]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates the geometrical properties of self-gravitating $N$-body systems from the perspective established by Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein concerning the operational nature of measured geometry. Utilizing recent numerical analyses of central configurations–special equilibrium solutions to the Newtonian $N$-body problem–we uncover systematic spatial variations in nearest-neighbor particle separations correlated with the radial distance from the system's center of mass. We argue that these variations reflect a context-dependent, emergent effective geometry shaped by gravitational interactions, in accordance with Poincaré's assertion that measured geometry depends on the forces influencing measuring devices, and Einstein's view that rods and clocks define physical geometry through their local dynamics. By revisiting these foundational insights within a modern computational framework, we provide evidence that geometry in self-gravitating Newtonian systems is not a fixed background, but an emergent construct arising from internal physical interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01617" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Technological Understanding: On the cognitive skill involved in the design and use of technological artefacts</a><span class="id">[2503.01617]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although several accounts of scientific understanding exist, the concept of understanding in relation to technology remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a philosophical account of technological understanding: the type of understanding that is required for and reflected by successfully designing and using technological artefacts. We develop this notion by building on the concept of scientific understanding. Drawing on parallels between science and technology, and specifically between scientific theories and technological artefacts, we extend the idea of scientific understanding into the realm of technology. We argue that, just as scientific understanding involves the ability to explain a phenomenon using a theory, technological understanding involves the ability to use a technological artefact to realise a practical aim. Both theories and artefacts are tools, and using them successfully requires the cognitive skill of understanding. Technological understanding is thus conceived as the ability to recognise how a practical aim can be achieved by using a technological artefact. In a context of design, this general notion of technological understanding is specified as the ability to design an artefact that, by producing a phenomenon through its physical structure, achieves the intended aim. By analogy with De Regt's criterion of the intelligibility of theories, we give, as a precondition for technological understanding, a criterion for the intelligibility of a technological artefact. We illustrate our concept of technological understanding through two running examples: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and superconducting quantum computers. Our account highlights the epistemic dimension of engaging with technology and, by allowing for context-dependent specifications, provides guidance for testing and improving technological understanding in specific contexts.</p></div></details></article></body>
