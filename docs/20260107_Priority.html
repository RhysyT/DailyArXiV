This has the remarkable property that the position and velocity of the particles orbiting in their own self consistent potential are given exactly, in terms of time, by the truncations of sine and cosine functions to the first two terms in their respective Taylor series. The potential and density also have simple analytic expressions in terms of time as parameter. It is not being claimed that this system has any direct astronomical application. However, it does motivate a conjecture about the behaviour of the density, potential, and orbits near caustics in simulations of cold collisionless dark matter. It is a rather surprising result which might interest practitioners of stellar dynamics and serve as an elementary example in teaching the subject.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron temperature relations and the direct N, O, Ne, S and Ar abundances of 49959 star-forming galaxies in DESI Data Release 2</a><span class="id">[2601.02463]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the largest direct-method abundance catalogue of galaxies to date, containing measurements of 49$\,$959 star-forming galaxies at $z &lt; 0.96$ from DESI Data Release 2. By directly measuring electron temperatures across multiple ionization zones, we provide constraints on a number of electron temperature relations finding good consistency with previous literature relations. Using these temperature measurements, we derive reliable abundances for N, O, Ne, S and Ar and measure the evolution of abundances and abundance ratios of as a function of metallicity and other galaxy properties. Our measurements include direct oxygen abundances for 49$\,$766 galaxies, leading to the discovery of the two most metal-poor galaxies in the nearby Universe, with oxygen abundances of $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.77_{-0.03}^{+0.03}~\rm dex$ (1.2\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$) and $\rm 12+\log(O/H) = 6.81_{-0.04}^{+0.04}~\rm dex$ (1.3\% $\rm Z_{\odot}$). We identify a rare outlier population of 139 galaxies with high N/O ratios at low metallicity, reminiscent of galaxy abundances observed in the early Universe. We find these high N/O galaxies are more massive than typical galaxies at the same metallicity. We find the Ne/O ratio is constant at low metallicity but increases significantly at $\rm 12+log(O/H) &gt; 8.105\pm0.004$ dex. We show that the S/O and Ar/O abundance ratios are strongly correlated, consistent with the expected additional Type Ia enrichment channel for S and Ar. In this work we present an initial survey of the key properties of the sample, with this dataset serving as a foundation for extensive future work on galaxy abundances at low redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02469" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunting for the First Explosions at the High-Redshift Frontier</a><span class="id">[2601.02469]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed galaxies up to $z\sim14$, 300 Myr after the Big Bang, and several candidates have been discovered at $z\sim15-25$, with one candidate as high as $z\sim30$, only 100 Myr after the Big Bang. Such objects are unexpected, since theoretical studies have not predicted the existence of detectable galaxies at $z\sim30$. While any $z\sim30$ candidates may be contaminants at lower redshifts, we explore whether such extreme redshift sources could be consistent with hyper-energetic transient events linked to the formation of the first, metal-free, stars. Specifically, we consider pair-instability supernovae (PISNe), a predicted class of extreme thermonuclear explosions that leave no remnant behind. Using cosmological simulations, we investigate an overdense cosmic region, where star formation and subsequent PISNe occur at $z\sim30-40$, even within standard cosmology. Assessing the likelihood of such a region, the corresponding number of PISNe at $z\gtrsim20$, and their observed flux, we find that JWST has a non-negligible chance to detect a PISN event at extremely high redshifts. If a transient event were confirmed at $z\sim30$, this would provide a direct glimpse into the epoch of first star formation, dramatically extending the empirical reach of astronomy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Chance Superpositions: Largest Catalog of Quasar-Galaxy Pairs at a Projected Separation of $D \lesssim 20$ kpc</a><span class="id">[2601.02480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the largest catalogue to date of Galaxies On Top Of Quasars (GOTOQs), systems where the sightline to a background quasar passes directly through or very close to a foreground galaxy. Using $\approx$1.1 million quasar spectra from SDSS DR16 and the DESI Early Data Release, we identify 1345 unique GOTOQs over the redshift range $0.0045 \leq z \leq 1.09$, more than quadrupling the number previously known. The catalogue combines both absorption agnostic and absorption selected searches, enabling a statistically robust characterization of gas in galaxies at projected separations $D \lesssim 20$ kpc. The GOTOQ emission line ratios indicate that their host galaxies are predominantly normal, star forming disks with typical dust extinctions of $A_V \approx 0.5$ mag. We measure the MgII covering fraction at $D \lesssim 20$ kpc and find it to be remarkably high, $f_c = 98.2^{+1.3}_{-4.5}$ per cent, indicating that these systems trace gas rich, metal enriched regions at the disk halo interface. The median colour excess towards the quasar line of sight, $E(B-V) = 0.087$, is significantly higher than that of typical MgII absorbers, underscoring the dust rich nature of GOTOQ sightlines. From a high signal to noise composite spectrum, we report the first statistical detection of the diffuse interstellar band at $\lambda 4428$ ($W_r = 0.055 \pm 0.011$ angstrom), revealing the presence of complex organic molecules at the disk halo interface. This catalogue provides a powerful reference sample for future multi wavelength studies of gas flows, cold gas, and dust evolution in the inner circumgalactic medium.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02483" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHANG-ES XXXVI. Effects of spectral aging on radio scale heights</a><span class="id">[2601.02483]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Context. Cosmic rays and magnetic fields play an important role for the formation and evolution of galaxies. Radio continuum observations allows us to study them in the haloes of edge-on galaxies. Aims. We explore the frequency dependence of the radio scale height which depends on cosmic ray transport and electron cooling. We test the influence of fundamental galaxy properties, such as star-formation rate (SFR), mass and size. Methods. We used radio continuum data of 16 edge-on galaxies from the Continuum HAloes in Nearby Galaxies - an EVLA Survey (CHANG-ES). We included maps from the LOw Frequency ARray at 144 MHz and from the Jansky Very Large Array at 3 GHz with 7&quot; angular resolution. We extracted vertical intensity profiles within the effective radio radius and fitted beam-convolved double- exponential models to separate thin and thick discs. For the thick radio discs, we computed mean spectral indices and scale-height ratios between 144 MHz and 3 GHz. Results. We find a mean scale-height ratio of 1.26 \pm 0.16. This is much lower than what we would expect for either cosmic ray diffusion or advection if synchrotron and inverse Compton losses dominate for the electrons. There is a moderate positive correlation between the ratio and spectral index of the thick disc: galaxies with high ratios have flat radio spectra. The ratio does not depend on any other galaxy parameter. The radio spectrum of the thick disc, as indicated by the radio spectral index, steepens with total mass (strong correlation) and flattens with SFR-to-mass surface density (moderate correlation). Conclusions. Galaxies with galactic winds have flat radio continuum spectra and large scale heights at low frequencies. This shows effective transport of cosmic rays in such systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thick Disks, Thin Hopes: Suppressed Capture and Merger Rates in AGN</a><span class="id">[2601.02487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Multiple models have been suggested over the years to explain the structure and support of accretion disks around supermassive black holes, from the standard thin thermal-pressure-dominated $\alpha$-disk model to more recent models that describe geometrically thicker radiation or magnetic or turbulence-dominated disks. In any case, objects embedded in the disk (e.g. compact objects, stars, gas, dust) can undergo gravitational and hydrodynamic interactions with each other leading to interesting processes such as binary interaction/capture, gravitational wave merger events, dynamical friction, accretion, gap opening, etc. It has long been argued that disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) can enhance the rates for many of these events; however, almost all of that analysis has assumed specific thin-disk models (with aspect ratios $H/R \lesssim 0.01$). We show here that the rates for processes such as these that are mediated by gravitational cross-sections has a very strong inverse dependence on the thickness $H/R$ (scaling as steeply as $(H/R)^{-8}$), and $H/R$ can vary in the outer disk (where these processes are often invoked) by factors $\gtrsim 1000$ depending on the assumed source of pressure support in the disk. This predicts rates that can be lower by tens of orders-of-magnitude in some models, demonstrating that it is critical to account for disk parameters such as aspect ratio and different sources of disk pressure when computing any meaningful predictions for these rates. For instance, if magnetic pressure is important in the outer disk, as suggested in recent work, capture rates would be suppressed by factors $\sim 10^{10}-10^{20}$ compared to previous studies where magnetic pressure was ignored.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02494" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dynamical Origins of Azimuthal Metallicity Variations in the Galactic Disk: Insights from Kinematic Ridges with Gaia</a><span class="id">[2601.02494]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Kinematic and spectroscopic studies in the past few years have revealed coherent azimuthal metallicity variations across the Milky Way's disk that may be the result of dynamical processes associated with non-axisymmetric features of the Galaxy. At the same time, stellar kinematics from Gaia have uncovered ridge-like features in the velocity space, raising the question of whether these chemical and dynamical substructures share a common origin. Using a sample of disk stars from Gaia DR3, we find that azimuthal metallicity variations are correlated with kinematic ridges in the V_phi-R plane, suggesting a shared origin. We utilize a suite of Milky Way test-particle simulations to assess the role of transient spiral arms, the bar, and interactions with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy in simultaneously shaping both chemical and kinematic substructures. Among the physical mechanisms explored, bar and spiral arm interactions are the ones that consistently reproduce both the chemo-kinematic features and alignment observed in the Gaia data. While our model of an interaction with a Sagittarius-like dwarf galaxy can also induce kinematic and metallicity substructure, the amplitude of the azimuthal metallicity variations are too weak, suggesting this is likely not the dominant influence. Although additional contributing processes cannot be ruled out, the azimuthal metallicity variations observed in Gaia are best explained by a dynamical origin. Our results support the view that that azimuthal metallicity variations in the Galaxy are driven by similar dynamical mechanisms responsible for generating the kinematic ridges and co-moving groups.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02506" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Formation in Galaxy Collisions: Dependence on Impact Velocity and Gas Mass of Galaxies in GADGET-4 Simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.02506]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates variations in the star formation rate during galaxy collisions when the initial conditions of velocity and gas mass are altered. For this purpose, hydrodynamic simulations were performed using the GADGET-4 code, with initial conditions generated by the Galstep and SnapshotJoiner programs. Systems of two galaxies on a head-on collision course were modeled with relative initial velocities ranging from 100 km/s to 1000 km/s, considering two scenarios: the first with identical galaxies, and the second with galaxies of different sizes. In simulations of systems with higher initial relative velocities, both found more intense peaks in the star formation rate, triggered by the first contact of the collision, followed by a strong decline caused by gas dispersion. In contrast, for systems with lower initial velocities, mergers between galaxies were observed, leading to multiple peaks in the star formation rate. A greater initial distance between galaxies has also been linked to whether or not the galaxy system merges, since it implies longer timescales for gravitational action, which leads to higher relative velocities at the moment of collision. Furthermore, the star formation rate in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on initial gas content. Furthermore, the initial gas content in galaxies was found to have a clear dependence on star formation rates. Overall, our results show that the relative impact velocity, the initial distance between the galaxies, and the gas content are important parameters for analyzing the star formation rate in colliding galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02520" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The origin of strong $α$-element bimodalities in FIRE simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.02520]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of the Milky Way's characteristic features is a strongly bimodal distribution of $\alpha$-process elements, such as Mg, at fixed [Fe/H] in stellar abundances. We examine patterns in [Mg/Fe] versus [Fe/H] in FIRE-2 simulations of Milky Way-mass galaxies. Out of 16 galaxies, 4 are capable of producing a strongly bimodal distribution. In all four galaxies, the high-$\alpha$ population corresponds to an older, radially-compact, thick disk, and the low-$\alpha$ population corresponds to a younger, radially-extended, thin disk, similar to the this http URL transition from high- to low-$\alpha$ took $0.3-1.2\Gyr$ and began $5.5-6.5\Gyr$ ago. [Mg/Fe] decreased at relatively fixed [Fe/H], both in the galaxy overall and at fixed radii: Fe enrichment nearly balanced gas accretion (and therefore dilution), but Mg enrichment was weaker. Importantly, this transition occurred during a period of relatively low gas fraction ($5-15\%$), immediately after a rapid decline in star formation (halving within a few hundred Myr), which caused an increase in Fe-producing white-dwarf supernovae relative to Mg-producing core-collapse supernovae. Only one case coincided with a major merger coalescence. We find similar trends in measuring stars by their current radius and by their birth radius, therefore, radial redistribution did not play a dominant role in the formation of a bimodality or its spatial dependence today. Overall, in FIRE-2, strong $\alpha$-element bimodalities are relatively uncommon ($\sim25\%$), often not associated with a major merger, and arise primarily from a rapid decline in star formation during relatively low gas fraction.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catching 3I/ATLAS Using a Solar Oberth</a><span class="id">[2601.02533]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The third interstellar object to be discovered, 3I/ATLAS, has a unique and continually unfolding story to tell about its nature and origin as it is monitored by telescopes on Earth, orbiting Earth and around the Solar System. Previous research into missions using chemical propulsion have only really addressed the direct case, where the opportunity to launch already expired before 3I/ATLAS's discovery. In contrast, investigations herein exploit 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' to simulate an alternative indirect option for chemical propulsion, namely the Solar Oberth Manoeuvre (SOM). For a SOM, a low perihelion burn provides maximum benefit from the Oberth Effect, and accelerates the spacecraft rapidly towards the receding 3I/ATLAS. Though in principle feasible, results indicate this option presents significant challenges. For possible launch years between 2031 and 2037 inclusive, a 2035 launch permits the most efficient transfer to 3I/ATLAS. The reference mission requires a SOM at 3.2 Solar Radii from the Sun's centre, with an intercept after 35-50 years. It is found the SOM can leverage spacecraft masses up to $\sim{500}$ kg. Two or three solid propellant boosters could deliver the required SOM $\Delta$V, and furthermore a refuelled Starship Block 3 in LEO has sufficient performance for such a mission. As inevitable with a SOM, some of the payload mass would be needed for a heat shield to protect against the high solar flux at low perihelion.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Composite Bulges - V. Detecting signatures of gas inflows in IFU data: The MUSE view of ionised gas kinematics in nearby galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.02534]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using VLT/MUSE data, we study the ionised-gas kinematics in a mass- and volume-limited ($M_* \geq 10^{10} M_\odot$, $D \leq 20$ Mpc) sample of 21 nearby galaxies to identify signatures of extended shocks within their inner kiloparsec, which appear as coherent velocity jumps in kinematic maps. By removing angular momentum, shocks in gas cause inflows, which can trigger nuclear star formation and fuel AGN activity. To identify the signatures of extended shocks, we examine residual velocity fields after subtracting a modelled rotating disc, and we study velocity difference between various gas tracers. Combining our kinematic analysis with BPT ionisation diagnostic maps and dust morphology, we find that 11 of 21 galaxies ($\sim$52%) show extended shock signatures with velocity jumps consistent with models of bar-driven shocks. This is likely a lower limit, as three additional galaxies ($\sim$15%) exhibit shocks along bars, potentially reaching the nucleus but obscured by AGN outflows. We trace shock signatures inwards close to the resolution limit, which suggests that shocks may be the prevailing mechanism of inflow in the central kpc of galaxies. The only two unbarred galaxies in our sample are also the only systems with unperturbed kinematics and no shocks, strongly linking the perturbed gas dynamics in centres of galaxies to the presence of bars. All galaxies with inner bars show LINER- or Seyfert-like nuclear emission, whereas galaxies without inner bars exhibit all emission types, indicating that regardless of gas supply, inner bars suppress star formation in galactic nuclei.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02579" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COUGS-DESI: A Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with Polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys</a><span class="id">[2601.02579]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Polar-structure galaxies (PSGs) host photometrically and kinematically decoupled components oriented at large angles to one another. These systems, which include polar rings, polar disks, polar halos, polar bulges, polar dust lanes, and polar tidal structures, provide valuable insights into galaxy formation and evolution, although their rarity has limited statistical studies. We aim to construct the largest and most homogeneous catalog of PSGs to date in order to enable robust statistical studies of their properties and occurrence rates in the local Universe. Using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DR10) data, we identified PSG candidates in the Siena Galaxy Atlas (SGA) through visual inspection, convolutional neural network classification, and cross-matching with previously reported systems. Each galaxy was assigned a PSG subtype and host morphology. We analyzed general properties of PSGs and compared them with those for all galaxies in the SGA. Simple image simulations were used to evaluate projection effects. The resulting Catalog of Unusual Galaxies with polar Structures in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (COUGS-DESI) contains 2,989 PSG candidates, including 342 previously known objects. Projection effects from random galaxy overlaps are negligible. The sample spans a wide range of polar morphologies, with 1,113 polar rings, 75 polar bulges, 216 polar halos, 185 polar dust lanes, and 1,315 polar tidal structures. PSGs constitute 2.2% of local non-dwarf galaxies, with polar rings representing 0.7%. Approximately 1% of S0 galaxies in the SGA host polar rings, whereas spirals constitute the most common morphological type among the PSG hosts in our catalog. COUGS–DESI increases the number of known PSG candidates by an order of magnitude and provides a foundation for detailed studies of the formation and evolution of polar structures.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">E-XQR-30: Evidence for an Increase in the Ionization State of Metal Absorbers from z 6 to z 2</a><span class="id">[2601.02634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the evolution of the ionization state of metal-enriched gas in and around galaxies near the epoch of reionization using a sample of 488 metal absorption systems at 4.3&lt;z&lt;6.3 from the E-XQR-30 survey. We classify the absorption systems based on whether they display only low-ionization absorption (CII, SiII, MgII), only high-ionization absorption (CIV, SiIV), or both. The percentage of low-ionization-only systems decreases from 24% at $z\sim$6 to 2% at $z\sim$4.3, whilst the fraction of high-ionization-only systems increases from 52% to 82%. For mixed absorbers (with both low and high ionization absorption), we use the column density ratios log(N_CII/N_CIV) and log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) to quantify the average ionization as a function of redshift. The log(N_SiII/N_SiIV) ratio does not change significantly over 5$\lesssim z \lesssim$6.3. We combine the E-XQR-30 log(N_CII/N_CIV) measurements with literature measurements at $z\sim$2-4 and find that the log(N_CII/N_CIV) ratio declines by a factor of $\sim$20 between $z\sim$6 and $z\sim$2. To explore possible drivers of this evolution, we run photoionization models of gas slabs illuminated by a uniform UV background at fixed density, metallicity and HI column density. We find that the increase in the ionization state of metal absorbers towards lower redshifts can likely be explained by some combination of 1) an increase in the metallicity of CIV-absorbing gas and 2) a decrease in the typical HI column densities of the absorbing gas, driven by the declining cosmic mean density and a rapid rise in the strength of the UV background during the final stages of reionization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02678" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Origin of Spin-Alignment of Dark Matter Subhalos</a><span class="id">[2601.02678]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Subhalo spin is essential for modeling galaxy formation and controlling systematic uncertainties in intrinsic alignment (IA) studies. However, the physical mechanisms governing subhalo spin acquisition within the tidal environments of host halos remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the alignment between subhalo and host halo spins using the high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation, Shin-Uchuu. We find that the spin alignment between subhalos and host halos becomes increasingly pronounced toward the central regions. Our analysis reveals that subhalos typically acquire spin in the same direction as their orbital angular momentum. Since the orbital angular momentum of most subhalos is aligned with the host halo spin, an overall alignment between subhalo and host spins emerges. When classified by orbital orientation, however, subhalo spins in the inner regions are found to be oriented perpendicularly or anti-parallel to the host spin for polar and retrograde orbits, respectively. These results provide strong evidence that subhalo spins are acquired through torques exerted by the tidal field of the host halo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mass ratio and the radial distance from the host center are the primary parameters governing subhalo spin alignment, while the dependence on the accretion redshift is found to be negligible.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02724" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Tale of Two Dust Disks in Our Milky</a><span class="id">[2601.02724]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmic dust plays a vital role in stellar and galactic formation and evolution, but its three-dimensional structure in the Milky Way has remained unclear due to insufficient precise reddening and distance measurements. Although early studies typically adopted a single-disk model, we detect two distinct components at Galactocentric distances of 5-14 kpc, enabled by photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric measurements of over 5 million stars. The thin dust disk's scale height increases radially from 60 to 200 pc, while the thick disk grows from 300 to 800 pc. For the first time, we find the thin and thick dust disk correlates spatially with molecular and atomic hydrogen disk, respectively. The thin, thick, and combined disks have scale lengths of 9.6+1.2-1.1 kpc, 4.2+0.4-0.3 kpc, and 6.6+0.3-0.3 kpc, respectively. The gas-to-dust ratio shows an exponential radial gradient, increasing from around 60 at 5 kpc to around 470 at 14 kpc. These findings provide new insights into dust morphology in the Galaxy and raise fundamental questions that require further investigation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02761" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Galactic Supernova Remnant Candidate at l =25.8, b=+0.2 Revealed by Near-Infrared Imaging and Spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2601.02761]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-resolution near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) candidate G25.8+0.2 obtained with the Immersion Grating Infrared Spectrograph (IGRINS) on the Harlan J. Smith Telescope. The source was originally discovered in the UKIRT Wide-field Infrared Survey for Fe+ (UWIFE; Lee et al. 2014). Our spectra reveal multiple kinematic components in the [Fe II] 1.644 um emission. The high-velocity components exhibit elevated [Fe II]/Br gamma ratios characteristic of shock excitation, while the low-velocity components are dominated by hydrogen and helium recombination lines and are consistent with photoionized gas, indicating an H II-region origin. G25.8+0.2 lies within the G26 complex, a large ( 15'x 30', corresponding to  28 pc x 57 pc at a distance of 6.5 kpc) star-forming region in the inner Galaxy.

Extending the array with an assumed lunar-based telescope could achieve $\sim 0.85\ \mu$as angular resolution at 230 GHz, enabling black hole shadow detection for a larger SMBH sample. The concept is motivated by space VLBI missions and lunar exploration, including the ongoing Lunar Orbit VLBI Experiment (LOVEX) aboard QueQiao-2 (Chang'E-7) and the planned International Lunar Research Station (ILRS). We assess shadow detectability for 31 SMBH with predicted large angular sizes, exploring different telescope location and antenna size. Assuming a telescope at the lunar antipode, we simulate the Moon-Earth (u,v) coverage and show that source geometry relative to the Moon's orbit determines whether the primary indicator of shadow, first visibility null, can be sampled. Using a geometric ring model, we identify six high-priority targets: M104, NGC 524, PGC 049940, NGC 5077, NGC 5252, and NGC 1052. Shadows of M104, NGC 5077, and NGC 1052 are detectable with a 5 m lunar-based telescope; PGC 049940 requires 20 m; NGC 524 and NGC 5252 require 100 m. Photon ring detection for Sgr A*, M87*, NGC 1600, and M31 is possible if space telescopes fill the baseline coverage gaps and sensitivity requirements are met. These results provide a clear scientific and technical motivation for lunar-based telescopes in future black hole shadow studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the Anisotropy of Dispersion Measure Contribution from the Galactic Halo by Using Fast Radio Bursts</a><span class="id">[2601.02849]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We propose a data-driven approach to reconstruct the all-sky distribution of the dispersion measure contribution from the Galactic halo ($\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$) through a spherical harmonic expansion, enabling an investigation of its possible anisotropies. Based on the NE2001 model and using 92 localized and 574 unlocalized non-repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs) at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;15^\circ$, we find a significant dipole anisotropy in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$, pointing toward $(l=130^\circ,\, b=+5^\circ)$ with a $1\sigma$ uncertainty of approximately $28^\circ$. The $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$ value in this direction is $63\pm9~\mathrm{pc~cm^{-3}}$, exceeding the all-sky mean by about $2.6\sigma$. This result is not significantly affected by the choice of Galactic ISM models. Furthermore, even when using a refined sample of 62 localized FRBs (excluding CHIME detections, repeaters, and unlocalized events), the dipole anisotropic structure persists, with a direction of $(l=141^\circ,\, b=+51^\circ)$ and a larger 1$\sigma$ uncertainty of $\sim 44^\circ$. Model comparisons using the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian evidence yield consistent preferences, and together they suggest that current FRB data slightly favor the existence of a dipole structure in $\mathrm{DM_{halo}}$. If this feature is not a statistical fluctuation or systematic error, its physical origin requires further investigation. Future FRB samples with larger sizes and more complete sky coverage will be essential to confirm or refute this possible anisotropic structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02861" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BEACON: JWST NIRCam Pure-parallel Imaging Survey.

Carefully selected from 36 independent pointings (corresponding to $\sim350$ arcmin$^2$ sky coverage), and hence with reduced cosmic variance, our galaxy candidates provide an unbiased sample for investigating galaxy properties over a wide range of environments. We measure the physical properties, including UV continuum slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}$), stellar mass ($M_*$), star formation rate (SFR), and sizes. Our highest redshift galaxy candidate at $z=13.71\pm0.15$ has a remarkably bright UV luminosity of $M_{\rm UV}=-21.19\pm0.08$, making it the brightest galaxy at $z&gt;12$ if spectroscopically confirmed. With an extremely blue UV slope, compact morphology, and high star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), this candidate may have extremely low metallicity, high ionizing photon escape fraction, or contributions from an AGN. Among our multiple independent sightlines, we identify three fields of galaxy number overdensity with $&gt;3\sigma$ significance. The properties of galaxies in various environments do not exhibit significant differences, implying either that accelerated galaxy evolution in overdense regions is not yet widespread at $z&gt;7$, or that the current constraints are limited by sample size. Our simulations indicate that increasing the sample by an order of magnitude would allow such environmental trends to be robustly confirmed or ruled out, underscoring the importance of future pure-parallel observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GATOS XI : Excess dust heating in the Narrow Line Regions of nearby AGN revealed with JWST/MIRI</a><span class="id">[2601.02865]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present JWST/MIRI imaging of eight nearby Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) from the GATOS survey to investigate the physical conditions of extended dust in their narrow line regions (NLRs). In four galaxies (ESO 428-G14, NGC 4388, NGC 3081, and NGC 5728), we detect spatially resolved dust structures extending  100-200 pc along the NLR. In these systems, we find a strong link between the morphology of the dust, the radio ejecta, and the coronal [Si VI] emission, implying that dust carries imprints of the processes shaping the NLR. Using spatially resolved spectral energy distributions, we show that dust in the NLR has systematically steeper slopes than star forming clumps. This dust emits at temperatures in the range 150 - 220 K, at a distance of  150 pc from the nucleus. Using simple models, we show that, even under optimistic assumptions of grain size and AGN luminosity, the excess MIR emission cannot be explained by AGN illumination alone. We interpret this excess heating as in-situ. We show that shocks with velocities of $v_{\rm shock} \sim 200- 400 \, \rm km/s$ in dense gas can close this gap, and in some cases even account for the total observed emission. This, combined with multiple lines of evidence for shocks in these regions, supports a scenario in which shocks not only coexist with dust but may be playing a key role in heating it. Our findings reveal shocks may be an important and previously overlooked driver of extended dust emission in the central hundreds of parsecs in AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02960" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discovery of an Extremely Luminous Type II Cepheid in the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream: Evidence for a Hierarchical Triple with an Inner Binary Merger</a><span class="id">[2601.02960]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of LAMOST J0041+3948, the most luminous post-AGB Type II Cepheid (TIIC) known, located in the Andromeda Giant Stellar Stream. Its spectral energy distribution (SED) exhibits a strong near-infrared excess, indicating the presence of a circumbinary dusty disk and hence binarity. SED fitting yields an effective temperature of $T_{\rm eff}=6738_{-262}^{+234}\,$K and a post-AGB luminosity of $\log(L/L_{\odot})=4.32_{-0.08}^{+0.07}$. Comparison with theoretical evolutionary tracks suggests a  $2.0$-$4.0\,M_{\odot}$ progenitor when accounting for a possible scattered-light contribution. ZTF Light curves reveal a pulsation period of 89d that lies close to the period-luminosity relation for long-period RV Tauri stars. Follow-up spectroscopy reveals clear $s$-process enrichment and signatures consistent with an accretion disk around the companion. The inferred progenitor is significantly younger and more massive than a typical stream member, suggesting that an additional mechanism such as a stellar merger is required. We propose a formation channel in which the present post-AGB binary descends from a hierarchical triple system. In this scenario, the inner binary merged after the system was displaced to its current location by the galaxy merger event, and the resulting massive merger remnant subsequently evolved into the extremely luminous post-AGB star observed today.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Long Tidal Feature Extending from a Low-Redshift Galaxy Revealed in Rubin Data Preview 1 Imaging</a><span class="id">[2601.03080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the Vera C.

We model a wide range of scales, roughly from $\sim 100 \; {\rm kpc}$ to $\sim 100 \; {\rm Mpc}$, using a theoretical framework based on the Halo Occupation Distribution and data from Year 3 of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) dataset. The new advances of this work include: 1) the generation and validation of a new stellar mass-selected galaxy sample in the range of $\log M_\star/M_\odot \sim 9.6$ to $\sim 11.5$; 2) the joint-modeling framework of galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing that is able to describe our stellar mass-selected sample deep into the 1-halo regime; and 3) stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) constraints from this dataset. In general, our SHMR constraints agree well with existing literature with various weak lensing measurements. We constrain the free parameters in the SHMR functional form $\log M_\star (M_h) = \log(\epsilon M_1) + f\left[ \log\left( M_h / M_1 \right) \right] - f(0)$, with $f(x) \equiv -\log(10^{\alpha x}+1) + \delta [\log(1+\exp(x))]^\gamma / [1+\exp(10^{-x})]$, to be $\log M_1 = 11.506^{+0.325}_{-0.404}$, $\log \epsilon = -1.632^{+0.306}_{-0.181}$, $\alpha = -1.638^{+0.108}_{-0.099}$, $\gamma = 0.596^{+0.251}_{-0.210}$ and $\delta = 3.810^{+2.045}_{-1.811}$. The inferred average satellite fraction is within $\sim 5-35\%$ for our fiducial results and we do not see any clear trends with redshift or stellar mass.

One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hills mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a framework based on kinematics to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 91 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A census of quiescent galaxies across $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8$ with JWST/MIRI: Mass-dependent number density evolution of quiescent galaxies in the early Universe</a><span class="id">[2510.12235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations have revealed a large population of quiescent galaxies (QGs) at high redshift ($z \sim 4-8$), challenging current models of early galaxy formation and quenching. Accurate number density estimates are crucial but remain uncertain. We present a systematic study of QGs at $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 8$ using a mass-complete sample from the JWST/PRIMER survey with deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging. We demonstrate that MIRI photometry is essential for refining the QG sample: it helps to mitigate contamination from dusty star-forming galaxies in the high-mass regime at $z \sim 3-5$ and aids in recovering lower-mass QG candidates at $z &gt; 5$ that are often missed without including MIRI data. We find that the evolution of the QG number density is strongly mass-dependent. The density of massive QGs ($\log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &gt; 10.6$) declines rapidly, falling from $n \approx 1.32\times10^{-5}~~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 3-4$ to $n &lt; 1 \times10^{-6}~~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 6$, and becomes negligible at $z &gt; 6$. In contrast, low-mass QGs ($9.5 &lt; \log (M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 10.6$) exhibit a remarkably constant number density of $n \sim 3\times10^{-6}~\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}}$ across the redshift range $z = 4-8$. This plateau suggests that these high-redshift, low-mass QGs may be galaxies undergoing temporary quenching episodes, likely subject to rejuvenation upon future gas accretion. Comparisons with leading galaxy formation models reveal significant tensions: most models underestimate the abundance of massive QGs at $z &gt; 4$ and fail to reproduce the flat density evolution observed for the low-mass population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS) Community Science Book</a><span class="id">[2511.00253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The AXIS Community Science Book represents the collective effort of 592 scientists worldwide to define the transformative science enabled by the Advanced X-ray Imaging Satellite (AXIS), a next-generation X-ray mission selected by NASA's Astrophysics Probe Program for Phase A study.

Once thought to be highly transient, our results demonstrate otherwise. Our sample consists of nine massive ($&gt;10^{10.5}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) star-forming barred-spiral galaxies at $z_{\rm spec} \sim 1.5$. Using rest-frame near-IR (F444W) JWST/NIRCam imaging, we apply ellipse fitting along with 1D and 2D morphological modeling to directly measure bar properties. We find that five galaxies host flat surface brightness profiles (bar Sérsic index $&lt;0.4$), indicative of highly evolved, &quot;mature&quot; bars. By contrast, only two galaxies show exponential profiles, characteristic of young bars, and these are also shorter in absolute length than the flat bars. We therefore conclude that a large fraction of bars at this epoch have already matured, thereby indicating the presence of well-settled disks required to facilitate bar formation and sustained evolution well before $z\sim1.5$. To assess the gravitational impact of the bars, we calculate the maximum transverse-to-radial force ratio ($Q_{b}$). We find that $Q_{b}$ values are comparable to, or weaker than, those of bars in the local Universe, Seven of the nine bars show only a marginal increase in strength with maturity (from exponential to flat bars). Contrarily however, the remaining two bars are flat, but have the lowest $Q_{b}$ values in our sample. We hence propose that the mature bars at $z\sim 1.5$ may experience phases of weakening due to rapid gas inflows and/or minor mergers. In conclusion, our work sheds light on the rapidly evolving nature of high-z bars and paves the way for larger statistical studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A high-dynamic-range view of the growth of structure and the warm/hot Universe</a><span class="id">[2512.13818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryons heat to temperatures above $&gt;\!\!10^5\,\mathrm{K}$ as they accrete onto massive overdensities – galaxies, groups, clusters, and filaments – where they ionize and become optically transparent.

Our toolchain combines ballistic coefficient estimation from on-orbit data with probabilistic orbit propagation under varying environmental conditions. Using TLE data and space weather records spanning six solar cycles, our three-stage validation approach progressively removes hindsight bias to arrive at fully predictive operational conditions. We achieve 1-year prediction accuracy (median continuously ranked probability score) of 6.0 days (1.6%) under perfect knowledge conditions, 18.6 days (5.1%) with estimated ballistic coefficients and known space weather, and 45.5 days (12.4%) under fully predictive conditions.

A custom semianalytic propagator provides a &gt;3500x speedup over Orekit and 4.5x speedup over DRAMA, enabling rapid Monte Carlo analysis across large satellite populations.

For kernels whose timescales are significantly longer than the typical exposure times, such GP kernels are sufficient. For time series where the exposure time is comparable to the kernel timescale, the observed signal represents an exposure-averaged version of the true underlying signal. This distinction is important in the context of recent data streams from Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) spectrographs like fast readout stellar data of asteroseismology targets and solar data to monitor the Sun's variability during daytime observations. Current solar EPRV facilities have significantly different exposure times per-site, owing to the different design choices made. Consequently, each instrument traces different binned versions of the same &quot;latent&quot; signal. Here we present a GP framework that accounts for exposure times by computing integrated forms of the instantaneous kernels typically used. These functions allow one to predict the true latent oscillation signals and the exposure-binned version expected by each instrument. We extend the framework to work for instruments with significant time overlap (i.e., similar longitude) by including relative instrumental drift components that can be predicted and separated from the stellar variability components. We use Sun-as-a-star EPRV datasets as our primary example, but present these approaches in a generalized way for application to any dataset where exposure times are a relevant factor or combining instruments with significant overlap.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02467" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the exceptionality of exceptional gravitational-wave events</a><span class="id">[2601.02467]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In gravitational-wave astronomy, as in other scientific disciplines, “exceptional” sources attract considerable interest because they challenge our current understanding of the underlying (astro)physical processes.

Mandel [ this http URL . 996 (2026) 1, L4] argued that apparent “exceptionality” may reflect measurement error rather than an extreme true value, and suggested that the total mass of GW231123 may be significantly overestimated. Here we present a quantitative analysis that supports this conceptual point. We find that claims of “exceptionality” obtained under agnostic priors should be critically questioned whenever measurement uncertainties are comparable to the width of the underlying population. Specifically, we find that the total mass of GW231123 is unlikely to be meaningfully affected by this effect while the spin of GW241110 is far less likely to be anti-aligned than initially claimed: about 70% of realizations that appear to yield an “exceptionally anti-aligned” spin are in fact consistent with either nonspinning or aligned configurations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving the Fe K$α$ Doublet of the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud G0.11-0.11 with XRISM</a><span class="id">[2601.02482]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fe K$\alpha$ line emission from Galactic center molecular clouds can be produced either via fluorescence after illumination by an X-ray source or by cosmic ray ionization. Unparalleled high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy obtained by XRISM-Resolve for the galactic center molecular cloud G0.11-0.11 resolves its Fe K$\alpha$ line complex for the first time, and points to a new method for discrimination between the X-ray reflection and cosmic ray ionization models. The Fe K$\alpha$ line complex is resolved into Fe K$\alpha_1$ at $E_{1} = 6.4040 \: \rm{keV}$ and Fe K$\alpha_2$ at $E_{2}= 6.3910 \:\rm{keV}$. Both lines have non-instrumental FWHM of $\approx 3 \:\rm{eV}$, close to the predicted quantum mechanical width of the lines, suggesting scant other sources of line broadening other than instrumental and quantum effects. We measure a radial velocity of $v_{\rm{LSR}} = 50 \pm 12_{fit} \pm 14_{scale} \:\rm{km/s}$ for G0.11-0.11, achieving the same precision reached by radio observations of such clouds. The high-resolution spectrum tests for the presence of secondary Fe K$\alpha$ lines, expected as a signature of cosmic ray proton/ion ionization. The absence of the secondary lines argues against the cosmic ray ionization model for G0.11-0.11. In the preferred X-ray reflection model, if the illuminating source is Sgr A$^{\star}$, the required luminosity for an X-ray outburst about 200 years ago is $L_8 \approx 10^{38} \:\rm{erg/s}$ in an $8\:\rm{keV}$-wide band at $8\:\rm{keV}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalable Gaussian Processes for Integrated and Overlapping Measurements Via Augmented State Space Models</a><span class="id">[2601.02527]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Astronomical measurements are often integrated over finite exposures, which can obscure latent variability on comparable timescales. Correctly accounting for exposure integration with Gaussian Processes (GPs) in such scenarios is essential but computationally challenging: once exposure times vary or overlap across measurements, the covariance matrix forfeits any quasiseparability, forcing O($N^2$) memory and O($N^3$) runtime costs. Linear Gaussian state space models (SSMs) are equivalent to GPs and have well-known O($N$) solutions via the Kalman filter and RTS smoother. In this work, we extend the GP-SSM equivalence to handle integrated measurements while maintaining scalability by augmenting the SSM with an integral state that resets at exposure start times and is observed at exposure end times. This construction yields exactly the same posterior as a fully integrated GP but in O($N$) time on a CPU, and is parallelizable down to O($N/T + \log T$) on a GPU with $T$ parallel workers. We present smolgp (State space Model for O(Linear/log) GPs), an open-source Python/JAX package offering drop-in compatibiltiy with tinygp while supporting both standard and exposure-aware GP modeling. As SSMs provide a framework for representing general GP kernels via their series expansion, smolgp also brings scalable performance to many commonly used covariance kernels in astronomy that lack quasiseparability, such as the quasiperiodic kernel. The substantial performance boosts at large $N$ will enable massive multi-instrument cross-comparisons where exposure overlap is ubiquitous, and unlocks the potential for analyses with more complex models and/or higher dimensional datasets.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02551" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using 23 Years of ACS/SBC Data to Understand Backgrounds: Significant Reductions in Expected Background Levels</a><span class="id">[2601.02551]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We have used 23 years of Hubble Space Telescope ACS/SBC data to study what background levels are encountered in practice and how much they vary. The backgrounds vary considerably, with F115LP, F122M, F125LP, PR110L, and PR130L all showing over an order of magnitude of variation in background between observations, apparently due to changes in airglow. The F150LP and F165LP filters, which are dominated by dark rate, not airglow, exhibit a far smaller variation in backgrounds. For the filters where the background is generally dominated by airglow, the backgrounds measured from the data are significantly lower than what the ETC predicts (as of ETC v33.2). The ETC predictions for `average' airglow are greater than the median of our measured background values by factors of 2.51, 2.64, 105, and 3.64, for F115LP, F122M, F125LP, and F140LP, respectively. A preliminary analysis suggests this could be due to certain OI airglow lines usually being fainter than expected by the ETC. With reduced reduced background levels, the shorter-wavelength SBC filters can conduct background-limited observations much more rapidly than had previously been expected. As of ETC v34.1, a new option will be included for SBC calculations, allowing users to employ empirical background percentiles to estimate required exposure times.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02556" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lazuli Space Observatory: Architecture &amp; Capabilities</a><span class="id">[2601.02556]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Lazuli Space Observatory is a 3-meter aperture astronomical facility designed for rapid-response observations and precision astrophysics across visible to near-infrared wavelengths (400-1700 nm bandpass). An off-axis, freeform telescope delivers diffraction-limited image quality (Strehl $&gt;$0.8 at 633 nm) to three instruments across a wide, flat focal plane. The three instruments provide complementary capabilities: a Wide-field Context Camera (WCC) delivers multi-band imaging over a 35' $\times$ 12' footprint with high-cadence photometry; an Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) provides continuous 400-1700 nm spectroscopy at R $\sim$ 100-500 for stable spectrophotometry; and an ExtraSolar Coronagraph (ESC) enables high-contrast imaging expected to reach raw contrasts of $10^{-8}$ and post-processed contrasts approaching $10^{-9}$. Operating from a 3:1 lunar-resonant orbit, Lazuli will respond to targets of opportunity in under four hours–a programmatic requirement designed to enable routine temporal responsiveness that is unprecedented for a space telescope of this size. Lazuli's technical capabilities are shaped around three broad science areas: (1) time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy, (2) stars and planets, and (3) cosmology. These capabilities enable a potent mix of science spanning gravitational wave counterpart characterization, fast-evolving transients, Type Ia supernova cosmology, high-contrast exoplanet imaging, and spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres. While these areas guide the observatory design, Lazuli is conceived as a general-purpose facility capable of supporting a wide range of astrophysical investigations, with open time for the global community. We describe the observatory architecture and capabilities in the preliminary design phase, with science operations anticipated following a rapid development cycle from concept to launch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02576" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Optomechanical platform for high-frequency gravitational wave and vector dark matter detection</a><span class="id">[2601.02576]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a proposal for a nanomechanical membrane resonator integrated into a moderate-finesse ($\mathcal{F}\sim 10$) optical cavity as a versatile platform for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter. Gravitational-wave sensitivity arises from cavity-length modulation, which resonantly drives membrane motion via the radiation-pressure force. This force also enables in situ tuning of the membrane's resonance frequency by nearly a factor of two, allowing a frequency coverage from 0.5 to 40 kHz using six membranes. The detector achieves a peak strain sensitivity of $2\times 10^{-23}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 40 kHz. Using a silicon membrane positioned near a gallium-arsenide input mirror additionally provides sensitivity to vector dark matter via differential acceleration from their differing atomic-to-mass number ratios. The projected reach surpasses the existing limits in the range of $2\times 10^{-12}$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$ $\text{eV}/c^2$ for a one-year measurement. Consequently, the proposed detector offers a unified approach to searching for physics beyond the Standard Model, probing both high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02599" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meteor observations as a tool to constrain cosmogonic models of the Solar System</a><span class="id">[2601.02599]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of small bodies of the Solar System showed evidence of the presence of refractory (asteroidal) material in the Oort cloud. Different models of the origin of the Solar System predict different numbers of rocky objects in the Oort cloud, meaning that measurement of this population can be used as an observational constraint for cosmogonic models. The aim of our work is to study how the data obtained from meteor observations can be used as a tool for distinguishing among the existing cosmogonic models. We investigated two meteor databases collected by the cameras of the All-Sky Meteor Orbit System (AMOS) located in the Canary Islands and in Chile. We describe methodology and results of the search for unusually strong rocky meteoroids on cometary orbits with the origin in the Oort cloud. These data will be used to calculate the fluxes of meteors of different compositions in order to constrain the ratio of icy and rocky components of the Oort cloud. For the flux determination, we estimate the observational time and effective area of the AMOS system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where does the simplified Stellar Contamination Model fail in Exoplanet Transmission Spectroscopy?</a><span class="id">[2601.02621]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar photospheric heterogeneities (e.g., starspots, faculae) distort the stellar spectrum in transit and imprint wavelength-dependent biases on the planet-to-star radius ratio (Transit Light Source Effect, TLSE). The Rackham-TLSE (R-TLSE) prescription applies a disc-averaged correction based solely on filling factor and spectral contrast, but transmission spectroscopy also depends on limb darkening, active-region distribution, and transit geometry. We include these in a pixel-resolved framework, ECLIPSE-Xlambda, and run idealised noise-free model-model comparisons to R-TLSE. For LHS 1140 b, K2-18 b, and WASP-69 b, disc-averaged corrections differ from the pixel model by up to about 400 ppm in the optical for active hosts and non-equatorial transits, but stay below about 10 ppm in the near-infrared where limb darkening is weak. We then apply both approaches to the JWST/NIRISS SOSS spectrum of LHS 1140 b. With limb darkening set to zero, ECLIPSE-Xlambda recovers stellar-contamination parameters matching the reference R-TLSE solution, confirming consistency in the disc-averaged limit. With wavelength-dependent limb darkening, reproducing the short-wavelength slope via stellar contamination alone requires hot faculae (delta Tfac about 600 K; ffac about 0.35), equivalent to a circular facular region of radius about 0.6 Rstar (about 60% of the stellar radius) on the disc; such an extended unocculted region is physically unlikely even for an active M dwarf. Purely stellar contamination would therefore require extreme faculae, whereas a genuine atmospheric contribution complementing a more modest facular signal is more plausible. These results delineate the validity regime of R-TLSE and underscore the need for geometry-aware stellar-heterogeneity models including limb darkening in high-precision transmission spectroscopy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Study of a Cosmic Ray Candidate Detected by the Askaryan Radio Array</a><span class="id">[2601.02718]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Experiments designed to detect ultra-high energy (UHE) neutrinos using radio techniques are also capable of detecting the radio signals from cosmic-ray (CR) induced air showers. These CR signals are important both as a background and as a tool for calibrating the detector. The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), a radio detector array, is designed to detect UHE neutrinos. The array currently comprises five independent stations, each instrumented with antennas deployed at depths of up to 200 meters within the ice at the South Pole. In this study, we focus on a candidate event recorded by ARA Station 2 (A2) that shows features consistent with a downward-going CR-induced air shower. This includes distinctive double-pulse signals in multiple channels, interpreted as geomagnetic and Askaryan radio emissions arriving at the antennas in sequence. To investigate this event, we use detailed simulations that combine a modern ice-impacting CR shower simulation framework, FAERIE, with a realistic detector simulation package, AraSim. We will present results for an optimization of the event topology, identified through simulated CR showers, comparing the vertex reconstruction of both the geomagnetic and Askaryan signals of the event, as well as the observed time delays between the two signals in each antenna.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SpaceWire-based Data Acquisition Network for the Solar Flare Sounding Rocket Experiment FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5</a><span class="id">[2601.02788]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We developed a SpaceWire-based data acquisition (DAQ) system for the FOXSI-4 and FOXSI-5 sounding rocket experiments, which aim to observe solar flares with high sensitivity and dynamic range using direct X-ray focusing optics. The FOXSI-4 mission, launched on April 17, 2024, achieved the first direct focusing observation of a GOES M1.6 class solar flare with imaging spectroscopy capabilities in the soft and hard X-ray energy ranges, using a suite of advanced detectors, including two CMOS sensors, four CdTe double-sided strip detectors (CdTe-DSDs), and a Quad-Timepix3 detector. To accommodate the high photon flux from a solar flare and these diverse detector types, a modular DAQ network architecture was implemented based on SpaceWire and the Remote Memory Access Protocol (RMAP). This modular architecture enabled fast, reliable, and scalable communication among various onboard components, including detectors, readout boards, onboard computers, and telemetry systems. In addition, by standardizing the communication interface and modularizing each detector unit and its associated electronics, the architecture also supported distributed development among collaborating institutions, simplifying integration and reducing overall complexity. To realize this architecture, we developed FPGA-based readout boards (SPMU-001 and SPMU-002) that support SpaceWire communication for high-speed data transfer and flexible instrument control. In addition, a real-time ground support system was developed to handle telemetry and command operations during flight, enabling live monitoring and adaptive configuration of onboard instruments in response to the properties of the observed solar flare.

Modern fiber positioner systems typically have overlapping patrol regions, resulting in the number of observable targets being highly dependent on the fiber assignment scheme. To maximize observable targets without fiber collisions, the algorithm proceeds in three steps. First, it assigns the maximum number of targets for a given field of view without considering any collisions between fiber positioners. Then, the fibers in collision are grouped, and the algorithm finds the optimal solution resolving the collision problem within each group. We compare the results from this new algorithm with those from a simple algorithm that assigns targets in descending order of their rank by considering collisions. As a result, we could increase the overall completeness of target assignments by 10% with this new algorithm in comparison with the case using the simple algorithm in a field with 150 fibers. Our new algorithm is designed for the All-sky SPECtroscopic survey of nearby galaxies (A-SPEC) based on the K-SPEC spectrograph system, but can also be applied to similar fiber-based systems with heavily overlapping fiber positioners.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration</a><span class="id">[2601.02577]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Utilizing anticoincidence veto in a search for gravitational-wave transients</a><span class="id">[2601.02713]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We devise a technique to suppress the effect of noise transients occurring at gravitational-wave detectors based on temporal anticoincidence. Searches for gravitational-wave signals in the detector data are prone to spurious disturbances of terrestrial origin.

Therefore, abnormally loud triggers that are not time-coincident can be vetoed. We implement the veto technique in a matched-filter search for transient signals from binary black holes and observe search backgrounds to be generally close to the Gaussian limit. An improvement in the sensitivity of the search is demonstrated using simulated signals.
