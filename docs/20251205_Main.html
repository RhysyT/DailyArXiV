A central challenge is to determine whether these deviations reflect genuine dynamical dark energy behavior or instead arise from cross-probe inconsistencies, prior choices, or mismatches in likelihood construction. Previous work demonstrated that imposing a biased supernova-motivated prior on Omega_{m0} can artificially displace the BAO-inferred w_0,w_a values from the LambdaCDM expectation. A complementary pedagogic study further showed that the differing degeneracy geometries of BAO, CMB, and SNe can generate apparent dark energy evolution even when the underlying cosmology is exactly LambdaCDM. In this manuscript, we develop a controlled tension injection framework that provides a systematic means of quantifying how probe-level tensions influence inferred dark energy parameters. Self-consistent BAO, CMB, and SNe mock datasets are augmented with parameterized shifts in (Omega_{m0}, H_0), supernova absolute calibration, and the BAO sound-horizon scale $r_d$. The resulting datasets are analyzed through a unified MCMC pipeline, enabling a direct assessment of how these controlled tensions propagate into biases in (w_0, w_a) and the pivot equation-of-state parameter w_p. This forecasting framework provides practical guidance for identifying probe combinations that are most susceptible to spurious signatures of dynamical dark energy, and helps ensure robust multi-probe inference in forthcoming precision surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The evolutionary history of ultra-compact accreting binaries. I. Chemical abundances and formation channel of the eclipsing AM CVn system ZTF J225237.05-051917.4 from HST spectroscopy</a><span class="id">[2512.04147]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AM Canum Venaticorum (AM CVn) stars are ultra-compact binary systems composed of a white dwarf (WD) primary accreting from a H-deficient donor. They are important as potential progenitors of Type Ia supernovae and laboratories for gravitational-wave studies, yet their evolutionary history remains unsolved. Three formation channels have been proposed: the WD channel, the He-star channel, and the cataclysmic variable (CV) channel. We aim to provide the first accurate measurements of the fundamental parameters of the accretor in ZTFJ225237.05-051917.4, including the abundances of key elements such as C, N, and Si, by analysing UV spectra obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. These measurements provide new insight into the system's evolutionary history and establish it as a benchmark to develop our pipeline for application to a larger sample of AM CVns. We determine the binary parameters from photometric modelling and constrain the atmospheric parameters of the WD accretor, including Teff, logg, and chemical abundances, by fitting the UV spectrum with synthetic spectral models. We then infer the system's formation channel by comparing our results with theoretical evolutionary models. We measure a Teff=23300$\pm$600K and a surface gravity of logg=8.4$\pm$0.3, which implies an accretor mass of 0.86$\pm$0.16 solar masses. We find a high N/C abundance ratio by mass of &gt;153. The accretor is significantly hotter than previous estimates based on simplified blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution, underscoring the importance of detailed spectral modelling for determining accurate system parameters. Our results show that UV spectroscopy is well-suited to constraining the formation channels of AM CVn systems. We conclude that the He-star channel can be excluded based on the high N/C ratio, while the WD and CV channels remain consistent with the observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04154" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resolving the terrestrial planet-forming region of HD 172555 with ALMA: I. Post-impact dust distribution</a><span class="id">[2512.04154]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant impacts between planetary embryos are a natural step in the terrestrial planet formation process and are expected to create disks of warm debris in the terrestrial regions of their stars. Understanding the gas and dust debris produced in giant impacts is vital for comprehending and constraining models of planetary collisions. We reveal the distribution of millimeter grains in the giant impact debris disk of HD 172555 for the first time, using new ALMA 0.87 mm observations at $\sim$80 mas (2.3 au) resolution. We modeled the interferometric visibilities to obtain basic spatial properties of the disk, and compared it to the disk's dust and gas distributions at other wavelengths. We detect the star and dust emission from an inclined disk out to $\sim$9 au and down to 2.3 au (on-sky) from the central star, with no significant asymmetry in the dust distribution. Radiative transfer modeling of the visibilities indicates the disk surface density distribution of millimeter grains most likely peaks around $\sim$5 au, while the width inferred remains model-dependent at the S/N of the data. We highlight an outward radial offset of the small grains traced by scattered light observations compared to the millimeter grains, which could be explained by the combined effect of gas drag and radiation pressure in the presence of large enough gas densities. Furthermore, SED modeling implies a size distribution slope for the millimeter grains consistent with the expectation of collisional evolution and flatter than inferred for the micron-sized grains, implying a break in the grain size distribution and confirming an overabundance of small grains.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tighter constraints on the atmosphere of GJ 436 b from combined high-resolution CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$ observations</a><span class="id">[2512.04161]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We aim to study the atmospheric properties of the warm Neptune GJ 436 b by combining a set of five transit events observed with the CARMENES spectrograph with one transit from CRIRES$^+$ so as to provide the most constrained results possible at high resolution. We removed telluric and stellar signals from the data using SysRem and potential planetary signals were investigated using the cross-correlation technique. Following standard procedures for undetected species, we performed injection recovery tests and Bayesian retrievals to place constraints on the detectability of the main near-infrared absorbers. In addition, we simulated ELT/ANDES observations by computing end-to-end in silico datasets with EXoPLORE. No molecular signals were detected in the atmosphere of GJ 436 b, which is consistent with previous studies. Combined CARMENES-CRIRES$^+$ injection-recovery and Bayesian retrieval analyses show that the atmosphere is likely covered by high-altitude clouds ($\sim$ $1$ mbar) at low and intermediate metallicities or, alternatively, is very metal-rich ($\gtrsim$ $900\times$ solar), which would suppress spectral features without invoking clouds. Simulations of ELT/ANDES observations suggest a boost by nearly an order of magnitude to the upper limit in the photon-limited regime, reaching $0.1$ mbar at $10$-$300\times$ solar metallicities. The joint analysis of all useful transit observations from CARMENES and CRIRES$^+$ provides the most stringent constraints to date on the atmospheric properties of GJ 436 b. Complementary CCF-based and retrieval approaches consistently indicate that the atmosphere is either cloudy or highly metal enriched. Any weak near-infrared absorption lines, if present, are likely to be below current detection limits. However, according to our simulations, these features may be revealed with ELT/ANDES even in single-transit observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04181" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dispersion in pulsar $γ$-ray efficiency</a><span class="id">[2512.04181]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The observational efficiency of pulsars, defined as the ratio of the observationally derived isotropic-equivalent luminosity, $4\pi d_{obs}^2 F_{obs}$, where $F_{obs}$ is the average pulsed energy flux of a pulsar and $d_{obs}$ is its estimated distance, to its energy budget, shows a wide range of values. This dispersion is believed to be a combination of beaming effects, different geometries, and case-by-case variability of the emission mechanism efficiency, but it is not clear in what proportion. In this work we focused on the gamma-ray range and analysed the four main ingredients that likely contribute to this dispersion: the geometrical term arising from the anisotropic emission (beaming), viewing and inclination angles, the uncertainty on the pulsar distance, the uncertainty on the moment of inertia, and the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism producing the gamma-ray emission. Estimating the expected ranges of the moment of inertia and the distance errors, and considering a geometrical and spectral model that we have recently used to fit the light curves and spectra of the entire gamma-ray pulsar population, we estimate the a priori distribution of the first three ingredients in order to obtain the a posteriori distribution of the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism. We found the latter to peak at $\sim 5-15 \%$ and to have a dispersion of around one order of magnitude. That is, we found the intrinsic efficiency of the mechanism to be the leading factor in the observed dispersion. In addition, we found little sensitivity of these results on different distributions of the estimated pulsar distance errors, and saw that the weak, alleged correlation with the spin-down power can only explain part of the observed dispersion. This methodology can be easily applied to other geometrical models of the emission, to test the sensitivity of these results on the beaming distribution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04186" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in the Virga Cloud Code II: Exploring the Effects of Key Cloud Parameters in Warm Neptune, Hot Jupiter and Brown Dwarf Atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2512.04186]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Aerosols and clouds are expected to be ubiquitous in exoplanet and brown dwarf atmospheres, where they can have a significant impact on transmission and emission spectra. The cloud code Virga is capable of quickly modeling cloud particle sizes as a function of altitude, and has recently been updated to include functionality for aggregates (ranging from very fluffy chains to compact fractals). We analyze the effect that these aggregates have on transmission spectra for typical warm Neptune and hot Jupiter environments, as well as their effect on emission spectra for an L-type brown dwarf, over the wavelength range 0.3 - 15 um. We find significant, measurable differences in spectra when particle shape is changed (particularly the shortest wavelengths where particle morphology strongly affects the scattering slope). We provide some intuitive rules for how non-absorbing aggregates impact spectra: when particle sizes are small compared to the wavelength of light, the most elongated and chain-like particles have the highest opacities. When particles are large, the inverse is true (the most compact shapes have the highest opacities). We present an explanation for these effects in terms of the dynamics of how the particles form and move through the atmosphere, as well as in terms of fundamental optics theory. Given the significant impact that particle shape can have on spectra, we strongly encourage the community to include shape as a free parameter in future case studies, atmospheric models, and retrievals.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04199" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primordial Black Holes from Inflation with a Spectator Field</a><span class="id">[2512.04199]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>How is the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in single-field models of inflation impacted by the presence of additional scalar fields? We consider the effect of a spectator field - a free scalar field with sub-Hubble mass, no direct coupling to the inflaton, and which makes a subdominant contribution to the total energy density - in the context of single-field models of inflation featuring a transient phase of ultra-slow roll (USR) evolution. Despite the modest title, a spectator field can have a dramatic impact: the slow-roll evolution of the spectator prevents the combined inflaton-and-spectator system from entering into USR, which naively might be expected to preclude the production of PBHs. However, we demonstrate that the growth of perturbations is maintained or enhanced by the spectator, through the rich interplay of curvature and isocurvature perturbations. We show in a model-independent way that the single-field phase of ultra-slow-roll is replaced by two turns in field space encompassing a phase of tachyonic instability for the isocurvature perturbations and a transfer of power from isocurvature to curvature modes. Furthermore, we highlight a degeneracy between the fine-tuning of the feature in the inflaton potential and the parameters of the spectator, leading to an overall resilience of model predictions to parameter variations. This makes it easier for the underlying PBH model to accommodate both high-precision CMB constraints and production of PBHs in the asteroid-mass range.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confronting cosmic shear astrophysical uncertainties: DES Year 3 revisited</a><span class="id">[2512.04209]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Cosmology from weak gravitational lensing has been limited by astrophysical uncertainties in baryonic feedback and intrinsic alignments. By calibrating these effects using external data, we recover non-linear information, achieving a 2% constraint on the clustering amplitude, $S_8$, resulting in a factor of two improvement on the $\Lambda$CDM constraints relative to the fiducial Dark Energy Survey Year 3 model. The posterior, $S_8=0.832^{+0.013}_{-0.017}$, shifts by $1.5\sigma$ to higher values, in closer agreement with the cosmic microwave background result for the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Our approach uses a star-forming 'blue' galaxy sample with intrinsic alignment model parameters calibrated by direct spectroscopic measurements, together with a baryonic feedback model informed by observations of X-ray gas fractions and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect profiles that span a wide range in halo mass and redshift. Our results provide a blueprint for next-generation surveys: leveraging galaxy properties to control intrinsic alignments and external gas probes to calibrate feedback, unlocking a substantial improvement in the precision of weak lensing surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04265" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Separating flare and secondary atmospheric signals with RADYN modeling of near-infrared JWST transmission spectroscopy observations of TRAPPIST-1</a><span class="id">[2512.04265]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Although TRAPPIST-1's temperate planets have the highest transmission signals of any known system, flares contaminate 50-70% of transits at the 1000 ppm level, far above 100 ppm secondary atmospheres. Efforts to mitigate flare contamination and assess impacts on radiation environments are each hampered by a lack of empirical spectral analysis and physics-based modeling. We present spectrotemporal analysis and radiative-hydrodynamic modeling of 5.5 hr of NIRISS and NIRSpec observations of 6 TRAPPIST-1 flares of 2.2-8.7x10^30 erg. Flare lines and continua are characterized using grid searches of RADYN beam-heating models spanning 10$^4\times$ in electron beam parameters. Best-fit models indicate these flares result from moderate-intensity beams with emergent electron fluxes of 10^12 erg s^-1 cm^-2 and energies $\leq$37 keV, although all models over-predict the Paschen jump. These models predict XUV, FUV, and NUV counterparts to the infrared peak fluxes of 8.9-28.9x10^27, 4.3-13.9x10^26, and 3.4-11.4x10^27 erg s^-1, respectively. Scaling the flare rate into the XUV suggests flaring contributes 1.35$_{-0.15}^{+2.0}\times$ quiescence yr$^{-1}$. We bin integrations of similar flare effective temperature to construct fiducial flare spectra from 2000-4500 K in order to develop separate empirical and RADYN-based mitigation pipelines. Both pipelines are applied to all 5.5 hr of R=10 data, resulting in maximum residuals from 1-2.8$\mu$m of 100-140 ppm and typical residuals of 54$\pm$14 and 65$\pm$17 ppm for the empirical and RADYN-based pipelines, respectively. Injection testing supports 3$\sigma$ detection capability for CO2 atmospheres with features of 150-250 ppm, with weak evidence (BF$\approx$3) still obtained at 130 ppm. Our results motivate multi-wavelength observations to improve model fidelity and test high-energy predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04266" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reanalyzing DESI DR1: 3. Constraints on Inflation from Galaxy Power Spectra &amp; Bispectra</a><span class="id">[2512.04266]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Models of cosmic inflation generically predict a weak but potentially detectable amount of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), which can be used to obtain insights into the degrees of freedom during inflation and their interactions. The simplest types of PNG are the local and non-local (equilateral and orthogonal) shapes of the primordial three-point correlators, which are predicted by models with multiple light fields and derivative interactions in single-field inflation, respectively. In this paper we place constraints on local, equilateral, and orthogonal non-Gaussianities using the power spectrum and bispectrum extracted from first public release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis makes use of higher-order clustering information through a consistent effective field theory (EFT) model for both the power spectrum and bispectrum at one-loop order. Using robust scale cuts where the EFT description is valid, we find the following constraints on PNG amplitudes: $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.1\pm 7.4$, $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=719\pm 390$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-200\pm 100$ (at $68\%$ CL). Non-local PNG constraints can be further improved by combining high-redshift DESI with legacy BOSS data and using simulation-based priors on bias parameters, yielding the strongest large-scale structure constraints to date $f^{\rm equil}_{\rm NL}=200\pm 230$, $f^{\rm orth}_{\rm NL}=-24\pm 86$. Our constraint on $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}$ is competitive with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) limit; the combination gives $f^{\rm loc}_{\rm NL}=-0.0\pm 4.1$, $18\%$ stronger than the CMB only result, which represents the strongest bound on multi-field inflation yet obtained.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04337" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Analysis of a Coronal Mass Ejection Leading Edge by Means of Multi-Spacecraft-in-Beam Phase Scintillation</a><span class="id">[2512.04337]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) was detected crossing the radio signals transmitted by the Mars Express (MEX) and Tianwen-1 (TIW) spacecraft at a solar elongation of $4.4^{o}$. The impact of the CME was clearly identifiable in the spacecraft signal SNR, Doppler noise and phase residuals observed at the University of Tasmania's Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) antenna in Ceduna, South Australia. The residual phases observed from the spacecraft were highly correlated with each other during the transit of the CME across the radio ray-path despite the spacecraft signals having substantially different Doppler trends. We analyse the auto- and cross-correlations between the spacecraft phase residuals, finding time-lags ranging between 3.18-14.43 seconds depending on whether the imprinted fluctuations were stronger on the uplink or the downlink radio ray-paths. We also examine the temporal evolution of the phase fluctuations to probe the finer structure of the CME and demonstrate that there was a clear difference in the turbulence regime of the CME leading edge and the background solar wind conditions several hours prior to the CME radio occultation. Finally, autocorrelation of the MEX two-way radio Doppler noise data from Ceduna and closed-loop Doppler data from ESA's New Norcia ground station antenna were used to constrain the location of the CME impact along the radio ray-path \add{to a region 0.2 AU from the Sun, at a heliospheric longitude consistent with CME origin at the Sun. The results presented demonstrate the potential of the multi-spacecraft-in-beam technique for studying CME structures in great detail, and providing measurements that complement the capabilities of future solar monitoring instruments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asymptotic constraints for 1D planar grey photon diffusion from linear transport with special-relativistic effects</a><span class="id">[2512.04342]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive a grey linear diffusion equation for photons with respect to inertial (or lab-frame) space and time, using asymptotic analysis in 1D planar geometry. The solution of the equation is the comoving radiation energy density. Our analysis does not make use of assumptions about the magnitude of velocity; instead we derive an asymptotic scaling in the lab frame such that we avoid apparent non-physical pathologies that are encountered with the standard static-matter scaling. We permit the photon direction to be continuous (as opposed to constraining the analysis to discrete ordinates). The result is a drift-diffusion equation in the lab frame for comoving radiation energy density, with an adiabatic term that matches the standard semi-relativistic diffusion equation. Following a recent study for discrete directions, this equation reduces to a pure advection equation as the velocity approaches the speed of light. We perform preliminary numerical experiments comparing solutions to relativistic lab-frame Monte Carlo transport and to the well-known semi-relativistic diffusion equation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solar Cycle Variation of Sustained Gamma Ray Emission from the Sun</a><span class="id">[2512.04360]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigated the occurrence rate of the sustained gamma ray emission (SGRE) events from the Sun using Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data covering solar cycle (SC) 24 and the rising and maximum phases of SC 25. Due to a solar array drive assembly malfunction starting in March 2018, only small number (15) of SGRE events were observed during SC 25. Over the first 61 months, the average sunspot number (SSN) increased from 56.9 in SC 24 to 79.0 in SC 25. Fast and wide (FW) CMEs and decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts also increased significantly in SC 25 by 29% and 33%, respectively when normalized to SSN. Therefore, the increase in solar activity should result in a higher number of SGREs in SC 25. We estimated the number of SGREs in SC 25 using three methods. (i) If the SGRE number varies commensurate FW CMEs and DH type II bursts, SC 25 should have 45-47 SGRE events. (ii) In SC 24,  17% of FW CMEs and 25% of DH type II bursts were associated with SGRE events. At this rate, SC 25 should have 46 SGRE events. (iii) Since SGRE events are invariably associated with &gt;100 keV hard X-ray (HXR) bursts, we identified DH type II bursts associated with &gt;100 keV HXR bursts from Fermi gamma ray burst monitor (GBM) during LAT data gaps. Based on our finding that SGRE events in SCs 24 and 25 were all associated with HXR bursts of duration &gt;  5 min, we found only 27 of the 79 LAT-gap type II bursts had &gt;100 keV HXR bursts with duration &gt;  5 min. These DH type II bursts are likely to indicate SGRE, bringing the total number of SGRE events to 42 (15 observed + 27 inferred). Thus, the three methods provide similar estimates of the number of SGRE events in SC 25. We, therefore, conclude that that SC 25 is stronger than SC 24 based on the estimated number SGRE events. Halo CMEs, ground level enhancement (GLE) events, and intense geomagnetic storms are also consistent with a stronger SC 25.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04378" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mini-supernovae from white dwarf-neutron star mergers: Viewing-angle-dependent spectra and lightcurves</a><span class="id">[2512.04378]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Unstable mass transfer may occur during white dwarf-neutron star (WD-NS) mergers, in which the WD can be tidally disrupted and form an accretion disk around the NS. Such an accretion disk can produce unbound wind ejecta, with synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mixed in. Numerical simulations reveal that this unbound ejecta should be strongly polar-dominated, which may cause the following radioactive-powered thermal transient to be viewing-angle-dependent. This issue has so far received limited investigation. We investigate how the intrinsically non-spherical geometry of WD-NS wind ejecta affects the viewing-angle dependence of the thermal transients. Using a two-dimensional axisymmetric ejecta configuration and incorporating heating from the radioactive decay of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, we employ a semi-analytical discretization scheme to simulate the observed viewing-angle-dependent photospheric evolution, as well as the resulting spectra and lightcurves. The observed photosphere evolves over time and depends strongly on the viewing angle: off-axis observers can see deeper, hotter inner layers of the ejecta and larger projected photospheric areas compared to on-axis observers. For a fiducial WD-NS merger producing 0.3 solar mass of ejecta and 0.01 solar mass of synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$, the resulting peak optical absolute magnitudes of the transient span from   -12 mag along the polar direction to   -16 mag along the equatorial direction, corresponding to luminosities of $10^{40}$-$10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The typical peak timescales are expected to be 3-10 d. We for the first time explore the viewing-angle effect on WD-NS merger transients. Since their ejecta composition and energy sources resemble those of supernovae, yet WD-NS merger transients are dimmer and evolve more rapidly, we propose using &quot;mini-supernovae&quot; to describe the thermal emission following WD-NS mergers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04420" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Exoplanetary Worlds and Elemental Survey (JEWELS) I: High-Precision Chemical Abundances of 20 FGK Planet-Hosting Stars from JWST Cycle 2</a><span class="id">[2512.04420]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present high-precision chemical abundances for 20 FGK stars hosting planets observed in JWST Cycle 2 GO programs. Using high-resolution, high-signal-to-noise ratio spectra from the ESO and Keck archives, we perform a strict line-by-line differential analysis relative to the Sun to derive stellar parameters and abundances of 19 elements from C to Zn. The stars span effective temperatures of 4500-6500 K and metallicities from -0.57 to +0.50 dex. The sample includes hosts of both gas giants and terrestrial planets, allowing direct comparison between stellar composition and planetary properties. Several of the giant planets orbit metal-rich stars. The detailed abundance patterns show clear chemical diversity, including carbon-enhanced but mildly metal-poor stars (TOI-824, TOI-1130, GJ 9827) and $\alpha$-enhanced metal-poor stars (TOI-561, GJ 9827, TOI-824). These variations trace differences in protoplanetary disk composition and may influence planetary interiors and atmospheric chemistry. The planet-hosts show a range of [C/O] ratios, and the diverse [Mg/Si] ratios may suggest varied interior compositions for their rocky planets. This homogeneous stellar abundance, together with future uniform JWST planetary atmosphere measurements, provides a foundation for exploring the planet mass-metallicity relation and the connection between stellar chemistry and planetary formation pathways. These results constitute the first step in a larger survey spanning multiple JWST cycles to systematically examine how host star composition shapes exoplanetary systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04508" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chlorine and Potassium Enrichment in the Cassiopeia A Supernova Remnant</a><span class="id">[2512.04508]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The elements in the universe are synthesized primarily in stars and supernovae, where nuclear fusion favors the production of even-Z elements. In contrast, odd-Z elements are less abundant and their yields are highly dependent on detailed stellar physics, making theoretical predictions of their cosmic abundance uncertain. In particular, the origin of odd-Z elements such as phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K), which are important for planet formation and life, is poorly understood. While the abundances of these elements in Milky Way stars are close to solar values, supernova explosion models systematically underestimate their production by up to an order of magnitude, indicating that key mechanisms for odd-Z nucleosynthesis are currently missing from theoretical models. Here we report the observation of P, Cl, and K in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM, with the detection of K at above the 6$\sigma$ level being the most significant finding. Supernova explosion models of normal massive stars cannot explain the element abundance pattern, especially the high abundances of Cl and K, while models that include stellar rotation, binary interactions or shell mergers agree closely with the observations. Our observations suggest that such stellar activity plays a significant role in supplying these elements to the universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining regular primordial black holes with isocurvature gravitational waves</a><span class="id">[2512.04548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We find the constraint on the population of ultra-light regular primordial black holes (RPBHs) by using isocurvature gravitational waves (GW). If ultra-light RPBHs dominated the early Universe, the initial isocurvature perturbation is converted into curvature perturbation that induce second-order GW background upon evaporation of RPBHs. The upper limit of extra relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, which could be inferred from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis or Cosmic Microwave Background observations, places a constraint on the maximum energy density of GW, which in turn can be used to constrain the RPBH population. As RPBHs have different lifetime from their singular counterparts, the constraint must be modified accordingly. While the formalism that we provide is generic, we work out explicitly the case of Simpson-Visser metric for demonstration. The RPBHs associated with this metric have lower Hawking temperature and smaller horizon size, leading to a longer lifetime than the singular Schwarzschild black holes. This implies a stronger constraint on RPBH population as they dominate the Universe for a longer period of time and generate stronger GW.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04606" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The GAPS programme at TNG LXXI.

A complete understanding of the population of long-period GPs and BDs would be pivotal in understanding this topic, but the number of such objects with precisely measured orbital and physical parameters is still small. Moreover, their dynamical influence on smaller companions in inner orbits is still unclear. Within the GAPS programme, we aim to confirm and characterize sub-stellar companion candidates from Gaia DR3, and to study the potential presence of additional lower-mass planets in their systems. We present the results of an intensive high-precision RV monitoring of HD 128717, which hosts the astrometric candidate Gaia-ASOI-009. We used the HARPS-N spectrograph at TNG to collect a high-cadence RV time series of the target. We used MCMC analyses to refine the Gaia DR3 orbital solution of the companion and, finally, performed a combined model of RV and proper motion anomaly (PMa) to derive the complete 3-D orbit of the companion. We also ran a suite of numerical simulations to confirm our results. We confirm the sub-stellar nature of Gaia-ASOI-009, i.e. Gaia-6 B: from the combined RV+PMa fit, we confirm that it is a high-eccentricity low-mass brown dwarf with $P_\text{B} = 9.37^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$ yr, $M_\text{B} = 19.8 \pm 0.5$ $M_\text{J}$, $e_\text{B}=0.85$, $i_\text{B} = 130^{\circ}$. The derived orbital solution differs significantly from the one published in Gaia DR3. Through a series of dedicated simulations, we demonstrate that this discrepancy arises from a degeneracy in the Gaia DR3 astrometric solution. Specifically, the combination of Gaia-6 B long orbital period and high eccentricity, both poorly constrained by the limited timespan of DR3, led to an incorrect solution characterized by a shorter period and lower eccentricity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04627" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connections between the cycle-to-cycle light curve and O-C variations of the Blazhko RR Lyrae stars</a><span class="id">[2512.04627]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent studies have shown that the irregular O-C variations observed in many non-Blazhko RR Lyrae stars may result from random, cycle-to-cycle (C2C) variations in their light curves. However, centuries-long data series reveal that the O-C diagrams of Blazhko stars exhibit particularly large-amplitude, irregular variations. In this Letter, we extend the previous investigation of non-Blazhko stars to Kepler Blazhko stars to explore the role of C2C variations in the O-C diagrams. We derived the O-C diagrams from Kepler space telescope light curves using a precise template-fitting method. Based on their Fourier analyses, we also constructed residual O-C diagrams that were pre-whitened for frequencies associated with the Blazhko effect. We then fitted the same statistical models to both types of O-Cs that we had previously applied to non-Blazhko stars. The optimal statistical model includes the C2C variation for 74% of the O-C curves in our Blazhko sample, and the parameter describing the strength of the C2C variation is significantly larger than that obtained for non-Blazhko stars. This may explain the strong irregular O-C variations previously observed in Blazhko stars. Furthermore, we found a strong positive correlation between the C2C variation strength and the amplitude of the frequency-modulation component of the Blazhko effect, indicating a connection between the two phenomena.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the magnetic field evolution of interplanetary coronal mass ejections from 0.07 to 5.4 au</a><span class="id">[2512.04730]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A central question for understanding interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) physics and improving space weather forecasting is how ICMEs evolve in interplanetary space. We have updated one of the most comprehensive in situ ICME catalogs to date, which now includes 1976 events from 11 space missions covering over 34 years, from December 1990 to August 2025. We have combined existing catalogs including magnetic obstacles and identified and added boundaries of an additional 807 (40.8%) events ourselves. With this catalog, we demonstrate the most extensive analysis to date of total ICME magnetic field values as a function of heliocentric distance. Parker Solar Probe has observed 6 ICMEs at $&lt; 0.23$ au (until April 2025), and Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo have added more events near 0.3 au, bridging the major observational gap towards the solar corona. Our main result is that a single power law can describe the evolution of the mean total magnetic field (exponent value of $k=-1.57$) and maximum field ($k=-1.53$) in the magnetic obstacle (MO), from 0.07 to 5.4 au. Extending the power law to the solar photosphere reveals a strong inconsistency with magnetic field magnitudes observed in the quiet Sun and active regions by 2 and 4 orders of magnitude, respectively. We introduce a multipole-type power law with two exponents, $k_1=-1.57$, and $k_2=-6$, relating the ICME magnetic field magnitude to an average solar active region field strength. These results present important observational constraints for the evolution of ICMEs from the Sun to the heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of the Dormant Black Holes with Luminous Companions from Binary or Triple Systems</a><span class="id">[2512.04774]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, a class of dormant black hole binaries with luminous companions (dBH-LC) has been observed, such as $Gaia$ BH1, BH2, and BH3. Unlike previously discovered X-ray BH binaries, this type of dBH-LC has relatively long orbital periods (typically more than several tens to a few hundred days) and shows very weak X-ray emission. Therefore, studying the formation and evolution of the whole dBH-LC population is also a very interesting problem. Our aim is to study the contribution of massive stars to the dBH-LC population under different evolutionary models (isolated binary evolution (IBE) and hierarchical triple evolution), and different formation channels (such as mass transfer, common envelope evolution). Using the Massive Objects in Binary Stellar Evolution (MOBSE) code, the Triple Stellar Evolution (TSE) code, and the latest initial multiple-star distributions, we model the populations of massive stars. Finally, we calculate the orbital properties, mass distributions, and birthrates of the BH-LC populations formed under these different conditions. In the Milky Way, we calculate that the birthrate of dBH-LC formed through IBE is about 4.35$\times$$10^{-5}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$, while the birthrate through triple evolution is about 1.47$\times$$10^{-3}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$. This means that the birthrate from triple evolution is one to two orders of magnitude higher than that from IBE. We find that in triple evolution, the main formation channel of dBH-LC is post-merger binaries formed from inner binary mergers triggered by von Zeipel$-$Lidov$-$Kozai oscillations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-term X-ray variability of the multiple-planet host L 98-59: Hints of an activity cycle</a><span class="id">[2512.04817]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-energy irradiation in X-rays and UV (XUV) can transform the planetary atmospheres through photoevaporation and photochemistry. This is more crucial for M stars, whose habitable zones for Earth-like planets are located within a few percent of an AU. Transiting exoplanets around M dwarfs offer the opportunity to study their characteristics and habitability conditions. L 98-59 is an M3 dwarf hosting six Earth-like planets, with two of them in the habitable zone of the star. X-ray observations made in 2020 and 2021 detected significant flares above a quiescent luminosity of 4-10 x 10^26 erg/s. We present the results from two short XMM-Newton observations of L 98-59, which are part of a monitoring survey to detect long-term X-ray variability and activity cycles. In October 2024 the X-ray quiescent luminosity of the star was about 5.9 x 10^25 erg/s, and it was about 6.3 x 10^26 erg/s in February 2025. We speculate that in late 2024 the star had a minimum of activity; in 2021 the star was near a maximum of an activity cycle, and in 2025 it was at the middle of the cycle. We suggest a coarse estimate of the period of about 2 years and a peak-to-peak amplitude of about 10, which is the highest among the stars with a known X-ray cycle other than the Sun. We also infer that even the outer planet in the habitable zone, L 98-59f, is exposed to an X-ray dose between 100 and 1600 times the X-ray irradiation of the Earth in the XMM band.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing TeV Afterglow Emission of GRB 221009A with Gaussian Structured jet in Wind-driven medium</a><span class="id">[2512.04893]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent detections of very high energy (VHE; GeV-TeV) photons from gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows, most notably the extreme event GRB 221009A, require refined models that include realistic jet structures and complex circumburst environments. The jet's angular structure is crucial for shaping afterglow emission. Our recent work demonstrates that Gaussian jets, with their smooth angular decline, naturally produce early bright peaks for on-axis observers and delayed, softer, dimmer peaks at higher inclinations. The gradual decline suppresses excessive lateral expansion, unlike the sharp edge in top-hat jets, making Gaussian jets a compelling alternative to both top-hat and other structured-jet models. Here we implement a Gaussian structured-jet model to explain TeV afterglows from adiabatic forward shocks propagating in a wind-driven medium. We show that the TeV peak time and flux depend sensitively on jet geometry, kinetic energy, wind density, and on microphysical parameter ratios that scale the SSC component. We identify the afterglow parameter space that is favourable for detecting sub-TeV photons with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), finding that only about ten per cent of simulated TeV events exceed CTA sensitivity in a wind medium. These detections arise from near core-aligned views, with high kinetic energy and wind density, moderate initial Lorentz factor and downstream magnetic field, and a relatively large fraction of energy in nonthermal electrons. Applying this model to GRB 221009A, we perform multi-band fits including wind-modified dynamics, Klein-Nishina effects, and EBL attenuation, and find that a mildly off-axis geometry reproduces the observed X-ray and GeV-TeV light curves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04900" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Local mixing length theory with compositional effects:\ First application to asymptotic giant branch evolution</a><span class="id">[2512.04900]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>During the evolution of stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB), thermal pulses lead to the formation of strongly stratified layers in the outer regions of the CO core, which might lead to inversions in the chemical gradient. Such inversions would produce instabilities beyond the ones predicted by the Schwarzschild criterion and the standard use of mixing length theory (MLT). We used a set of MLT equations that consider the impact of the background chemical gradients. This extension of MLT is referred to in this work as MLT$\sharp$, to make a distinction between both prescriptions. We applied MLT$\sharp$ in tandem with the more general Ledoux instability criterion. We computed the evolution in the AGB phase and compared the chemical profiles resulting from MLT, MLT$\sharp$ and the double diffusive GNA theory. We continued the evolution through a post-AGB thermal pulse and performed a pulsational analysis of the resultant GW Vir models to asses $g$-mode pulsation periods. Finally, we tested our results with pulsation properties of known GW Vir stars derived from recent observations. We find that the much simpler MLT$\sharp$ set of equations closely reproduces the results from the GNA theory. As such, MLT$\sharp$ offers a simple way to include chemically driven convection in stellar evolution computations. Stellar evolution simulations show that Rayleigh-Taylor and thermohaline instabilities can play an important role during the TP-AGB. We obtained significantly different chemical profiles using a standard MLT approach compared to those resulting from our MLT$\sharp$ and GNA computations. Our adiabatic pulsational analysis shows that these differences in the chemical stratification leave clear mode-trapping signatures in the pulsation spectrum of the GW Vir models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oxygen Isotope Constraints on the Importance of Photochemical Processing in Protoplanetary Disks</a><span class="id">[2512.04944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations have revealed evidence of photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks. This processing occurs in the photon dominated layer, the optically thin regions of the disk high above the disk midplane. It remains unclear, however, how much this photochemical processing impacts the compositions of the planets and their building blocks within the disk. Here we use the oxygen isotopic compositions of Solar System solids, which has been attributed to photochemistry in the solar nebula, to quantitatively evaluate whether this processing could have produced the conditions needed to provide the diversity of compositions seen in the Solar System. We do this by modeling the chemical evolution while fine dust grows into the building blocks of the planets. We find that the oxygen isotopic evolution cannot be attributed to processing in the solar nebula and must instead be inherited from the parent molecular cloud. Further, our results indicate that the observed photochemical processing in protoplanetary disks does not significantly impact the compositions of planets that form within.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04946" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MALLORN: Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on Observations of Real Nuclear transients</a><span class="id">[2512.04946]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's 10-Year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to produce a hundredfold increase in the number of transients we observe. However, there are insufficient spectroscopic resources to follow up on all of the wealth of targets that LSST will provide. As such it is necessary to be able to prioritise objects for followup observations or inclusion in sample studies based purely on their LSST photometry. We are particularly keen to identify tidal disruption events (TDEs) with LSST. TDEs are immensely useful for determining black hole parameters and probing our understanding of accretion physics. To assist in these efforts, we present the Many Artificial LSST Lightcurves based on the Observations of Real Nuclear transients (MALLORN) data set and the corresponding classifier challenge for identifying TDEs. MALLORN comprises 10178 simulated LSST light curves, constructed from real Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations of 64 TDEs, 727 nuclear supernovae and 1407 AGN with spectroscopic labels using Gaussian process fitting, empirically-motivated spectral energy distributions from SNCosmo and the baseline from the Rubin Survey Simulator. Our novel approach can be easily adapted to simulate transients for any photometric survey using observations from another, requiring only the limiting magnitudes and an estimate of the cadence of observations. The MALLORN Astronomical Classification Challenge, launched on Kaggle on 15/10/2025, will allow competitors to test their photometric classifiers on simulated LSST data to find TDEs and improve upon their capabilities prior to the start of LSST.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intertwined birth and death: a Herbig-Haro outflow resolves the distance to Vela Junior</a><span class="id">[2512.04956]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The distance to the Vela Junior supernova remnant (RX J0852.0-4622 or G266.2-1.2) has long remained uncertain, limiting our understanding of its physical properties.

This link ties stellar birth and death, with the young star Ve 7-27 embedded in material expelled by Vela Junior's massive progenitor, and the remnant's blast wave is expanding through the same medium. Adopting the Gaia-based distance to Ve 7-27, we revise Vela Junior's distance to $1.41\pm0.14$ kpc. At this distance, the remnant's physical radius is $23.3\pm2.3$ pc, and X-ray proper motions of the northwestern rim correspond to shock speeds of $(2.8\pm0.7)\times10^3$ to $(5.6\pm1.5)\times10^3$ km s$^{-1}$. These imply an age of $\sim$1.6-3.3 kyr and a very low ambient density, indicating that Vela Junior is expanding within a highly rarefied wind-blown cavity carved by a massive progenitor – consistent with the non-detection of strong thermal X-ray emission. This distance update also resolves long-standing inconsistencies, with major implications for its energy budget, particle acceleration efficiency, and compact object evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04972" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Internal superfluid response and torque evolution in the giant glitch of PSR J1718-3718</a><span class="id">[2512.04972]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the post-glitch rotational evolution of pulsars by analyzing the 2007 giant glitch of PSR J1718$-$3718 using a vortex creep model that incorporates both inward and outward nonlinear vortex motion, along with a time-varying external torque. A comprehensive fitting framework is developed, constrained by prior knowledge of moment of inertia participation from previous glitch studies. We apply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to quantify uncertainties and parameter correlations. The model reproduces the observed timing data and yields physically consistent values for moment of inertia fractions and creep timescales. Our results indicate that inward creep and a long-term change in external torque dominate the observed increase in spin-down rate, pointing to structural changes within the star-likely triggered by a crustquake that initiated both vortex motion and a change in the moment of inertia. We estimate that the glitch involved approximately $2.4 \times 10^{12}$ inward-moving vortices and $\sim 142$ crustal plates with a typical size of $\sim 0.03$ km.

From detailed numerical simulations we find that the bubbles are generically surrounded by type-II curvature fluctuations. Special attention is given to the distribution of initial conditions, including the relevant mean profiles and shape dispersion around them. For the adiabatic channel, we extend the logarithmic template formula $\zeta[\zeta_G]$, which maps the Gaussian curvature perturbation to the fully non-Gaussian one while incorporating mode evolution, and we compare this with numerical results obtained using the $\delta N$ formalism. While the template departs from numerical results near its logarithmic divergence, it still provides accurate threshold values for PBH formation in the parameter range relevant to our analysis. Finally, we compute the PBH mass functions for both channels. We find that the adiabatic channel dominates over the bubble-induced channel by a factor $\sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^{2})$, and that both contributions are largely dominated by the mean profiles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">30.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sensitivity of Hongmeng 21cm experiment on scattering dark matter</a><span class="id">[2512.05056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scattering between dark matter and baryon can cool intergalactic medium temperature and deepen the 21cm signal.

The spectral index $n_s$ of the primordial power spectrum provides a window into early universe, and constraints on $n_s$ play an important role in discriminating early universe models such as models of cosmic inflation. Historically constrained by cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, the constraints on $n_s$ shift upward when CMB data is combined with the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Recent work explained the origin of this and the relation to the BAO-CMB tension between CMB experiments and DESI BAO, and as a case study presented constraints on $n_s$ from the combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 data and DESI DR2 data. Here we present constraints from Planck (PR3 and PR4), ACT, the South Pole Telescope (SPT), and the combination of all three CMB experiments, CMB-SPA, with and without DESI DR2 BAO data, and with and without CMB lensing data. In all cases the constraint on $n_s$ is shifted upwards when DESI is included, with the largest shift exhibited by ACT. This is accompanied by a commensurate shift in the constraint on the optical depth to reionization $\tau$, which is again greatest for ACT. When CMB data are combined into CMB-SPA and combined with DESI the $n_s$ constraint disfavors at more than $2\sigma$ the inflation models preferred by Planck alone, such as Higgs, Starobinsky, and exponential $\alpha$-attractors, in favor of other models, such as polynomial $\alpha$-attractors. This work motivates the further study of the tension between CMB and DESI BAO data, and of the rich interplay between $n_s$ and $\tau$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Questions related to the Deflection of Light by Gravity determined by Soldner, Einstein and Schwarzschild</a><span class="id">[2512.04128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Before we discuss the deflection of light in a gravitational field, we give a brief overview of some basic physical formulas on photon properties, generation and propagation.

A WIMP with mass around the weak scale not only happens to have the correct thermal relic abundance to be the dark matter (DM), it can also give rise to the necessary critical boundary at the TeV scale through its Yukawa couplings to the Higgs. We use a higgsino-like singlet-doublet model to illustrate our Higgs-DM criticality scenario and show that if this WIMP DM mass is observed to be greater than  1.2 TeV then it necessarily implies a strong bound on the Higgs mass and an upper bound on the scale of heavy new physics that restores vacuum stability. It can be thoroughly probed in direct detection experiments, astrophysical signals and future collider searches, further motivating a comprehensive exploration of the remaining heavy WIMP parameter space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04167" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Popcorn EMRIs: Transient Gravitational Wave Signals and Their Analysis in Schwartz Space</a><span class="id">[2512.04167]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate extreme-mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) with orbital periods exceeding the observational timescale of mHz gravitational wave observatories. In their early, highly eccentric phases, these systems generate transient gravitational wave bursts during pericentre passages, separated by long quiescent intervals; we designate these signals “popcorn EMRIs.” We utilize a steady-state analytical model based on the continuity equation in phase space to estimate the population in a Milky Way-like galaxy. The normalization of this model is linked to the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation describing stellar relaxation. Adopting a conservative one-year observation baseline ($P&gt;1$ year), we estimate the steady-state population of popcorn EMRIs. We forecast an observable burst rate of 5 to 44 events per year. The low duty cycle ($\sim 10^{-4}$) confirms their manifestation as isolated transients. Individual bursts from the Galactic Centre exhibit high detectability. Analyzing these intrinsically transient signals demands a rigorous mathematical framework, as standard windowing techniques distort burst morphology. We establish an analytical foundation using standard smoothing techniques commonly used in real analysis. This yields the mathematically correct definition for the Fourier transform of transient signals, justifying the use of the direct Fourier transform without ad hoc windowing and ensuring the integrity of spectral analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04168" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electroweak phase transition in SMEFT: Gravitational wave and collider complementarity</a><span class="id">[2512.04168]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the electroweak first-order electroweak phase transition (FO-EWPT) within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework induced by dimension-6 operators.

We demonstrate potentially observable consequences of inflation with a finite initial time in a model in five-dimensional warped anti-de Sitter space, with both a UV and an IR brane present during inflation. Considering an inflaton with an approximately flat potential localized on the UV brane, we derive the resulting brane motion in the bulk and the 4D effective action describing the dynamics. A concrete model allows us to evaluate possible consequences of a starting point of inflation. The background evolution is driven by the fast roll of the radion at early times and the slow roll of the inflaton at late times. We find that the action has the form of a two-field hyperbolic inflation model, the two fields being the radion and the inflaton, both of which have a time-dependent background solution. This setup is holographically dual to an inflaton coupled to a strongly coupled confined sector in which the confinement scale is larger than the Hubble scale, and a confinement scale whose ratio to the 4D Planck scale evolves cosmologically. Focusing on the period when the equation of state becomes that of inflation, we find that the presence of the IR brane leads to deviations from the approximate de Sitter background in addition to those from the slow-roll parameters of the inflaton potential. We quantify the effect of the presence of the IR brane on the two point function of the adiabatic scalar perturbations and tensor perturbations. The dominant deviations occur at large scales: the adiabatic power spectrum has a blue tilt, while the tensor power spectrum shows oscillatory features. We present numerical fits to the shape of the adiabatic power spectrum, and discuss the implications for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04206" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</a><span class="id">[2512.04206]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron–proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core–crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Z' portal dark matter from post-inflationary reheating: WIMPs, FIMPs, and UFOs</a><span class="id">[2512.04229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the production of dark matter (DM) via a heavy $Z'$ mediator during the post-inflationary reheating epoch.

This is the first systematic study of $Z'$ portal DM which includes UFO. We find that much of the available parameter space for keV to TeV DM lies in the UFO regime for $ 1 \text{ TeV}\lesssim M_{Z'} \lesssim 1 \text{ PeV}$. When the mediator mass $M_{Z'}$ is greater than both the DM mass and the reheating temperature, UFO is a robust mechanism for producing cold DM. Although UFO DM is initially &quot;hot&quot; after freeze-out, it can easily become cold before structure formation if freeze-out occurs during post-inflationary reheating. Compared to standard freeze-in, UFO can accommodate significantly stronger interaction strengths (stronger couplings and/or smaller mediator masses).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04240" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations of Spectator Scalar Fields</a><span class="id">[2512.04240]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a mechanism for gravitational wave (GW) production from isocurvature perturbations in spectator scalar fields during inflation. These energetically subdominant fields develop blue-tilted power spectra through inflationary dynamics, generating second-order scalar perturbations that source a stochastic GW background. The mechanism naturally satisfies CMB constraints at large scales while producing enhanced signals at smaller scales across a broad frequency range $10^{-20} - 1$ Hz. We perform comprehensive numerical and analytical calculations of the complete isocurvature spectrum evolution, including gravitational particle production, reheating dynamics, and scalar-induced GW generation. For spectator fields with effective masses $0.5 \lesssim m_{\chi,\mathrm{eff}}/H_I$, the resulting GW energy density reaches $\Omega_{\text{GW}} h^2 \sim 10^{-20}$-$10^{-12}$, accessible to pulsar timing arrays, space-based interferometers, and next-generation CMB experiments. Our analysis reveals that GW-induced constraints exceed current isocurvature bounds. We examine both unstable (curvaton-like) and stable (dark matter) spectator fields, demonstrating strong sensitivity to reheating temperature, inflaton-spectator coupling, and decay dynamics. This framework establishes isocurvature-sourced GWs as a powerful probe of early universe physics, enabling simultaneous constraints on inflationary dynamics, dark matter production, and reheating through coordinated multi-frequency GW observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04376" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linear stability of nonrelativistic Proca stars</a><span class="id">[2512.04376]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We study the linear stability of nonrelativistic Proca stars under generic perturbations.

In the model, the relativistic, gaussian quark wavefunction is used to describe the nucleon structure. We first evaluate the energy density, chemical potential, pressure and sound velocity within the ideal Fermi gas picture. In this case, those physical quantities are discontinuous or divergent at the quark saturation density, where quarkyonic phase emerges. To remove such singular behavior, we next introduce an infrared regulator, and combine the dual quarkyonic model and the QMC model to include the nuclear interaction – we call it the quarkyonic quark-meson coupling (QQMC) model. We then find that the quark saturation density depends strongly on the nucleon size. For example, when $r_p = 0.6\, (0.8)$ fm, where $r_p$ is the root-mean-square radius of proton, the quark saturation density is about $3.6\,(1.5) \times \rho_0$ in symmetric nuclear matter, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. It is notable that the nuclear interaction is quite important to consider physical quantities quantitatively. In fact, the QQMC model can produce the sound velocity which is consistent with that inferred from the observed data of several neutron stars. Furthermore, pressure in symmetric or pure neutron matter deduced from the experiments of heavy-ion collisions at high energy can be explained by the QQMC model as well. We discuss in detail the formulation for the QQMC model and the physical quantities calculated by the model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals Embedded in Dark Matter Halo II: Chaotic Imprints in Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2512.04848]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the imprints of chaos in gravitational waves from extreme-mass-ratio inspirals configuration, where a stellar massive object, confined in a harmonic potential, orbits a supermassive Schwarzschild-like black hole embedded in a Dehnen-type dark matter halo. In our first paper [1], we demonstrated the system's transition from non-chaotic to chaotic dynamics by analyzing Poincaré sections, orbital evolution, and Lyapunov exponents across different energies and dark matter halo parameters. In this work, we compute the gravitational waveforms of the small celestial object along different chaotic and non-chaotic orbits by implementing the numerical kludge scheme. We further perform a spectral analysis of the gravitational waveforms from such orbits. In particular, we show that when the system is in a chaotic state, the gravitational wave signals are characterized by broader frequency spectra with finite widths, enhanced amplitude and energy emission rate, distinctly differentiating them from the signals generated during the system's non-chaotic state. Through recurrence analysis we also show that the time series of gravitational waveforms strain carry unique information on the motion of chaotic dynamics, which can be used to distinctly differentiate from non-chaotic to chaotic motion of the source. Furthermore, we discuss the potential detectability of these orbits for upcoming observatories like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji, emphasizing the significant potential for detecting chaotic imprints in gravitational waves to substantially enhance our understanding of chaotic dynamics in black hole physics and the dark matter environments of galactic nuclei.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04934" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on Genesis Cosmology from the Smeared Null Energy Condition</a><span class="id">[2512.04934]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The violation of the null energy condition (NEC) is essential for constructing nonsingular cosmological scenarios, such as Genesis cosmology, which avoids the initial singularity by initiating cosmic evolution from an asymptotically Minkowski state.

Above the surface both fields are in good approximation harmonic vector fields determined by their values at the body's surface or any other surface enclosing the body. The intensity problem seeks to determine harmonic vector fields vanishing at infinity and with prescribed intensity of the field at the surface. This problem constitutes a nonlinear boundary value problem, whose general solvability is not yet established. In this paper {\em axisymmetric} harmonic fields ${\bf H}$ outside the unit sphere $S^2$ are studied and, given an axisymmetric Hölder continuous intensity function $I\neq 0$ on $S^2$, the existence of infinitely many solutions of the intensity problem is proved. These solutions can more precisely be characterized as follows: fix a number $\de \in \nat\setminus \{1 \}$ and a meridional plane $M$ through the symmetry axis $S\!A$, and in $M$ a unit circle $S^1$ (symmetric with respect to $S\!A$) and, furthermore, $2\, N$, $N \in \nat_0$, points $z_n \in M$ (symmetric with respect to $S\!A$, avoiding $S\!A$, and outside $S^1$), then the existence of an (up to a sign) unique harmonic field ${\bf H}$ is established that vanishes at (the axisymmetric circles piercing $M$ at) $z_n$ and nowhere else, that has intensity $I$ at $S^2$ and (exact) decay order $\de$ at infinity. The proof is based on the solution of a nonlinear elliptic equation with discontinuous coefficients, which are, moreover, singular at the symmetry axis. Its combination with fixed boundary conditions was the basis of a recent treatment of the “geomagnetic direction problem” \cite{KR22}. Here we have instead natural boundary conditions, which provide less information, and which require, therefore, in part new solution techniques and sharper estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the treatment of thermal effects in the equation of state on neutron star merger remnants</a><span class="id">[2512.05118]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present results from long-term, numerical-relativity simulations of binary neutron star mergers modeled using both, fully tabulated, finite-temperature, equations of state and their corresponding hybrid representations.

Our study focuses on the analysis of the spectra of the post-merger gravitational-wave signals and on how these are affected by the treatment of thermal effects in the two EOS representations. Our simulations highlight distinct differences in the GW frequency evolution related to the thermal modeling of the EOS, demonstrating that deviations from established quasi-universal relations become significant at late post-merger phases. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the HMNS against convection. Employing both the Ledoux criterion, necessary condition for the development of convective instabilities, and the Solberg-Høiland criterion, a generalized criterion for axisymmetric perturbations based on a combined analysis of the Brunt-Väisälä frequency and of the epicyclic frequency, we show that differential rotation and thermal stratification in the HMNS give rise to local (yet sustained) convective patterns that persist beyond 100 ms after merger. Those convective patterns, while substantially different between tabulated and hybrid EOS treatments, trigger the the excitation of inertial modes with frequencies smaller than those attained by the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and are potentially within reach of third-generation GW detectors. The late-time excitation of inertial modes, previously reported in studies based on hybrid EOS, is fully supported by the tabulated, finite-temperature EOS simulations presented here, which account for thermal effects in a more consistent way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12792" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Resonant neutrino self-interactions and the $H_0$ tension</a><span class="id">[2303.12792]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we study the previously unexplored resonant region of neutrino self-interactions.

We use linear cosmological datasets to test neutrino self-interactions for a sample of fixed scalar mediator masses in the range $10^{-2}$ eV $\leq m_{\varphi}\leq 10^{2}$ eV. The resonant behavior produces observable effects at lower couplings than those reported in the literature for heavy and light mediators. We observe that in the best case scenario, using the Planck + BAO dataset, the tension with local measurements of $H_0$ eases from 4.9$\sigma$ (for $\Lambda$CDM) down to 2.8$\sigma$. Albeit, this is driven mainly by the addition of extra radiation, with $\Delta N_{\rm eff}\sim 0.5$. The joint dataset which includes Planck, BAO, and $H_0$ prefers a nonzero interaction from 2.3$\sigma$ to 3.9$\sigma$ significance in the range $0.5$ eV $\leq m_{\varphi}\leq 10$ eV.

In this first paper, we investigate a base-level model of the magnetohydrodynamic processes around the interface between these two regions, using five three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic simulations in the zero-net flux regime. We employ physically motivated profiles for Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar diffusion, alongside a simplified thermodynamic model comprising a cool disc and hot corona. Our results show that, first, large-scale coherent poloidal magnetic field loops form in the magnetorotational instability active region. These loops lead to the accumulation of tightly wound magnetic flux at the disc-corona temperature transition, driving strong, localised accretion flows in the surface layers of the active region. Second, an axisymmetric pressure maximum, extending across multiple disc scale heights, develops as a result of outward mass transport from the active region. This, in turn, triggers the Rossby wave instability and leads to the development of anticyclonic vortices. Third, the dead zone develops magnetic field with a distinct morphology, likely resulting from the outward diffusion of the large-scale poloidal loops in the active zone. This self-consistently generated field exhibits a vertical structure that can drive accretion in the inner dead zone via a weak magnetic-pressure wind. In the second paper in the series, we extend this work to the vertical-net flux regime, where global magnetic flux transport and magnetically driven outflows become dynamically significant.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03113" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Continued radio observations of the persistent radio source associated with FRB20190520B provides insights into its origin</a><span class="id">[2507.03113]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Follow-up studies of persistent emission from fast radio burst (FRB) sources are critical for understanding their elusive emission mechanisms and the nature of their progenitors. This work presents new observations of the persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20190520B. We observe a gradual decay in the PRS brightness, which is punctuated by periods of brightening and dimming at both 1.5 and 3 GHz. Furthermore, our low-frequency ($&lt;1$ GHz) observations–the first for this source–reveal evidence of a spectral break, which can be attributed to absorption processes. Interpreted within the framework of the magnetar wind nebula model, our data constrain the age of the magnetar progenitor to $52^{+16}_{-10}$ yr, broadly consistent with previous work. Assuming the observed 1.5 GHz variability is driven by scintillation, we discuss the constraints on the size of the persistent source. The observations presented here challenge the predictions of the previously published best-fit hypernebula model for this source.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15436" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Semi-empirical Framework of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution: Highlighting a possible tension between Demographics and Gravitational Wave Background</a><span class="id">[2507.15436]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution of the supermassive Black Hole (BH) population across cosmic times remains a central unresolved issue in modern astrophysics, due to the many noticeable uncertainties in the involved physical processes that span a huge range of spatial, temporal and energy scales. Here we tackle the problem via a semi-empirical approach with minimal assumptions and data-driven inputs. This is based on a continuity plus Smoluchowski equation framework that allows to unitarily describe the two primary modes of BH growth: gas accretion and binary mergers. Key quantities related to the latter processes are incorporated through educated parameterizations, and then constrained in a Bayesian setup from joint observational estimates of the local BH mass function, of the large-scale BH clustering, and of the nano-Hz stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background measured from Pulsar Timimg Array (PTA) experiments. We find that the BH accretion-related parameters are strongly dependent on the local BH mass function determination: higher normalizations and flatter high-mass slopes in the latter imply lower radiative efficiencies and mean Eddington ratios with a stronger redshift evolution. Additionally, the binary BH merger rate is estimated to be a fraction $\lesssim 10^{-1}$ of the galaxy merger rate derived from galaxy pairs counts by \texttt{JWST}, and constrained not to exceed the latter at $\gtrsim 2\sigma$. Relatedly, we highlight hints of a possible tension between current constraints on BH demographics and the interpretation of the nano-Hz GW background as predominantly caused by binary BH mergers. Specifically, we bound the latter's contribution to $\lesssim 30-50\%$ at $\sim 3\sigma$, suggesting that additional astrophysical/cosmological sources are needed to explain the residual part of the signal measured by PTA experiments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One-Loop Galaxy Bispectrum: Consistent Theory, Efficient Analysis with COBRA, and Implications for Cosmological Parameters</a><span class="id">[2507.22110]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an efficient and accurate pipeline for the analysis of the redshift-space galaxy bispectrum multipoles at one-loop order in effective field theory (EFT). We provide a systematic theory derivation based on power counting, which features the first comprehensive treatment of stochastic EFT contributions – these are found to significantly improve the match to data. Our computational pipeline utilizes the COBRA technique that expands the linear matter power spectrum over a basis of principal components based on a singular value decomposition, allowing the cosmology dependence to be captured to sub-permille accuracy with just eight templates. This transforms the problem of computing the one-loop EFT bispectrum to a simple tensor multiplication, reducing the computation time to around a second per cosmology with negligible loss of accuracy. Using these tools, we study the cosmological information in the bispectrum by analyzing PTChallenge simulations, whose gigantic volume provides the most powerful test of the one-loop EFT bispectrum so far. We find that the one-loop prediction provides an excellent match to the bispectrum data up to $k_{\rm max}=0.15~h$ Mpc$^{-1}$, as evidenced by the precise recovery of the dark matter density $\omega_\text{cdm}$, Hubble constant $H_0$, and mass fluctuation amplitude $\sigma_8$ parameters, and the amplitude of equilateral primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil}$. Combined with the power spectrum, the COBRA-based one-loop bispectrum multipoles yield tighter constraints than the tree-level bispectrum monopole, with the posteriors on $\omega_{\text{cdm}}$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$ shrinking by 41\%, 25\%, and 19\%, respectively. This suggests that the COBRA-based bispectrum analysis will be an important tool in the interpretation of data from ongoing redshift surveys such as DESI and Euclid.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02652" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PSR J0614-3329: A NICER case for Strange Quark Stars</a><span class="id">[2508.02652]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Precise measurements of neutron star masses and radii by the NICER mission impose important constraints on the nuclear equation of state.

Considering all the NICER measurements to date, we find substantial evidence using Bayesian hypothesis ranking for strange quark stars over physically motivated models of neutron stars compatible with this low radius. This provides a strong case for quark matter in neutron stars and also for the possible existence of strange quark stars, a consequence of the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis, suggesting that they could be considered among the population of compact stars during analyses of astrophysical data.

The satellite Actaea was fully blended with Salacia at the spatial resolution of the integral field unit, and we extracted the combined spectrum. The 0.7$-$5.1 $\mu$m reflectance spectra of Salacia$-$Actaea and Máni display prominent water-ice absorption bands at 1.5, 2, 3, and 4$-$5 $\mu$m. The $\nu_{3}$ fundamental vibrational band of carbon dioxide ice at 4.25 $\mu$m is present in both spectra. From a quantitative band-depth analysis of the entire current JWST spectroscopic sample of water-ice-rich KBOs, we find strong evidence for a positive covariance between relative water-ice abundance and size, which may indicate the emergent impacts of internal differentiation and cryovolcanic production of surface water ice on midsized KBOs. A detailed look at the distribution of 2 and 3 $\mu$m band depths suggests additional sources of variability, such as different water-ice grain sizes. In addition, we report an apparent transition in the carbon dioxide band depth at object diameters of roughly 300$-$500 km, with larger objects showing systematically weaker absorptions, although selection effects within the sample do not allow us to confidently distinguish between a size-dependent phenomenon and a correlation with dynamical class.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19235" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Silane-Methane Competition in Sub-Neptune Atmospheres as a Diagnostic of Metallicity and Magma Oceans</a><span class="id">[2508.19235]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The James Webb Space Telescope is characterising the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes. The presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes is expected to strongly alter the chemistry of their envelopes and observable atmospheres. At the magma ocean-envelope boundary (MEB, $&gt;$10 kbar), gas properties deviate from ideality, yet the effects of real gas behaviour on chemical equilibria remain underexplored. Here, we compute equilibrium between magma-gas and gas-gas reactions using real gas equations of state in the H-He-C-N-O-Si system for TOI-421b, a canonical hot sub-Neptune potentially hosting a magma ocean. We find that H and N are the most soluble in magma, followed by He and C. We fit real gas equations of state to experimental data on SiH$_4$, and show that, for a fully molten mantle, SiH$_4$ dominates at the MEB under accreted gas metallicity of 1$\times$ solar, but is supplanted by CH$_4$ at 100$\times$ solar. Lower mantle melt fractions lower both magma-derived Si abundances in the envelope and the solubility of H and He in magma, yielding H$_2$- and He-rich envelopes. Projecting equilibrium chemistry through the observable atmosphere (1 mbar-100 bar), we find that `clouds' of Si-bearing condensates strongly deplete Si-bearing gases, although SiH$_4$ remains key, especially when a solar gas is accreted. SiH$_4$/CH$_4$ and Si/C ratios increase with mantle melt fraction and decrease with accreted gas metallicity. The competition between SiH$_4$ and CH$_4$ is therefore diagnostic of metallicity and presence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes with equilibrium temperatures below 1000 K. The corollary is that H$_2$- and He-rich, SiH$_4$-deficient and CH$_4$-bearing observable atmospheres may indicate a limited role or absence of magma oceans on sub-Neptunes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05885" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What is the most massive gravitational-wave source?</a><span class="id">[2509.05885]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the presence of significant measurement uncertainties, the events which appear to be the most extreme are very likely to be those exhibiting the greatest statistical fluctuations.

I argue that its total mass may be significantly lower than $238^{+28}_{-49}$ solar masses as reported by Abac et al. (2025a). The maximum total binary black hole mass from an analysis of the entire detected population is below 170 solar masses if the same priors that are used for individual event analyses in the GWTC catalogs, including for the analysis of GW231123, are applied to the population as a whole.

The poloidal flux is approximated by the self-similar twisted dipole field. The toroidal field is obtained by the minimum torque model. Under this approximation, it is found that: (1) The Y-point radius decreases with the increase of twist of the magnetic field. (2) The polar cap is larger for larger twist. (3) The particle outflow luminosity is larger for larger twist. (4) The maximum acceleration potential, pulse width of magnetar radio emission both increase with the twist. (5) For an untwisting magnetosphere, the physical properties evolve toward that of the normal pulsars. The above findings are consistent with previous analytical and numerical results. The larger polar cap may correspond to the hot spot during magnetar outburst. In general, a rotating twisted magnetosphere has larger open field line regions. The radio emission of magnetars and fast radio bursts may both originate in the larger and evolving open field line regions of magnetars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12675" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cislunar Resonant Transport and Heteroclinic Pathways: From 3:1 to 2:1 to L1</a><span class="id">[2509.12675]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Understanding the dynamical structure of cislunar space beyond geosynchronous orbit is critical for both lunar exploration and for high-Earth-orbiting trajectories. In this study, we investigate the role of mean-motion resonances and their associated heteroclinic connections in enabling natural semi-major axis transport in the Earth-Moon system. Working within the planar circular restricted three-body problem, we compute and analyze families of periodic orbits associated with the interior 4:1, 3:1, and 2:1 lunar resonances. These families exhibit a rich bifurcation structure, including transitions between prograde and retrograde branches and connections through collision orbits. We construct stable and unstable manifolds of the unstable resonant orbits using a perigee-based Poincaré map, and identify heteroclinic connections - both between resonant orbits and with lunar $L_1$ libration-point orbits - across a range of Jacobi constant values. Using a new generalized distance metric to quantify the closeness between trajectories, we establish operational times-of-flight for such heteroclinic-type orbit-to-orbit transfers. These connections reveal ballistic, zero-$\Delta v$ pathways that achieve major orbit changes within reasonable times-of-flight, thus defining a network of accessible semi-major axes. Our results provide a new dynamical framework for long-term spacecraft evolution and cislunar mission design, particularly in regimes where lunar gravity strongly perturbs distant circumterrestrial orbits.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbulence and dust fragility in protoplanetary discs</a><span class="id">[2509.24818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dust growth from micron- to planet-size in protoplanetary discs involves multiple physical processes, including dust collisions, the streaming instability, and pebble accretion. Disc turbulence and dust fragility matter at almost every stage. Previous studies typically vary one of them while fixing the other, failing to provide a complete picture. Here, we use analytical models and numerical dust evolution models DustPy to study the combinations of gas turbulence and dust fragility that can reproduce multi-wavelength ALMA observables. We find that only appropriate combinations – fragile dust (fragmentation velocity $v_\mathrm{frag}$= 1-2 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-4}$ or resilient dust ($v_\mathrm{frag}$= 6-10 m/s) in discs with viscous $\alpha=10^{-3}$ – can reproduce observations. Our result is robust to two widely used opacities (DSHARP and Ricci opacities). Regardless of the strength of disc turbulence, reproducing observations requires observed dust rings to be optically thick at $\lambda=1.3$ and $3$ mm. As only small dust can be lifted above the midplane to reach the emitting layers, SED analysis probably yields lower limits on the maximum grain sizes. We highlight the challenge of creating detectable dust rings at large radii when incorporating bouncing in models, and the need for earlier formation of dust rings at smaller radii to reproduce the decreasing ring brightness with radius observed across ALMA wavelengths.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07234" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing new-physics scenarios with the combined LHAASO and Carpet-3 fluence spectrum of GRB 221009A: axion-like particles and Lorentz-invariance violation</a><span class="id">[2510.07234]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>From gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A, very high-energy photons were detected: &gt;10 TeV with LHAASO and &gt;100 TeV with Carpet-3.

Our population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z&gt;6$: $\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and $\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z&gt;6$ of $&lt;0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and $&lt;0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z&gt;5.5$. Our results indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z&lt;10$, their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching $\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z&gt;10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z&gt;16$ for \emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of $\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$.

We introduce a new dynamic model to describe the forms of the striae observed in comets Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1), West (C/1975 V1), and Seki-Lines (C/1962 C1). Charged particles made of refractory materials, with radii less than 0.5micrometer, are expelled from the comet's nucleus and accelerated by Lorentz forces near the nucleus. These particles decay many times to form striae, which have a lifespan of less than about 100 days at a distance of 1 astronomical unit from the sun. Over time, they continue to decay and eventually disappear from view. The following dynamic model explains these material science processes. Particles expelled from the comet's nucleus are subjected to three forces: solar gravity, solar radiation pressure, and Lorentz forces near the nucleus. As these particles decrease in size, the Lorentz forces and radiation pressure cause fluctuations, increasing and decreasing to form striae. This model, which is less of a dynamic approximation than previous theories (FLM3), explains the structure of the striae, enables predictions of their luminosity, and clarifies their origin.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21991" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Numerical implementation of flat FLRW models of cosmic expansion with Planck 2018 cosmological parameters</a><span class="id">[2511.21991]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present an explicit numerical implementation of the Friedmann equations to model the expansion of the Universe in spatially flat, homogeneous and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies.

Several studies have shown that Mars may play a significant role in these Milankovitch cycles, such as the 2.4 Myr eccentricity cycle related to perihelion precession dynamics. Here we provide the results of a detailed dynamical analysis that explores the Earth Milankovitch cycles as a function of the Martian mass to quantify the extent that Mars influences variations in Earth's orbital eccentricity, the longitude of perihelion, the longitude of the ascending node, and obliquity (axial tilt). Our results show that, although the 405 kyr long-eccentricity metronome driven by $g_2$ (Venus) and $g_5$ (Jupiter) persists at all Mars masses, the $\sim$100 kyr short-eccentricity bands driven by $g_4$ (Mars) lengthen and gain power as Mars becomes more massive, consistent with enhanced coupling among inner-planet $g$-modes. The 2.4 Myr grand cycle is absent when Mars approaches zero mass, reflecting the movement of $g_4$ with the Martian mass. Meanwhile, Earth's obliquity cycles driven by $s_3$ (Earth) and $s_4$ (Mars) lengthen from the canonical $\sim$41 kyr with increasing Mars mass, relocating to a dominant 45–55 kyr band when the mass of Mars is an order of magnitude larger than its present value. These results establish how Mars' mass controls the architecture of Earth's climate-forcing spectrum and that the Milankovitch spectrum of an Earth-like planet is a sensitive, interpretable probe of its planetary neighborhood.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</a><span class="id">[2512.03120]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$.

To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfvén velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfvén waves. The timescales on which Alfvén waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfvén waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfvén waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes.

The generation and acceleration of these non-thermal particles have been extensively studied, however, how these particles feed back on the shock hydrodynamics has not been fully treated. This work presents the results of self-consistent hybrid particle-in-cell simulations that show the effect of self-generated non-thermal particle populations on the nature of collisionless, quasi-parallel shocks. They contribute to a significant heat flux density upstream of the shock. Non-thermal particles downstream of the shock leak into the upstream region, taking energy away from the shock. This increases the compression ratio, slows the shock down, and flattens the non-thermal population's spectral index for lower Mach number shocks. We incorporate this into a revised theory for the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions that include this effect and it shows excellent agreement with simulations. The results have the potential to explain discrepancies between predictions and observations in a wide range of systems, such as inaccuracies of predictions of arrival times of coronal mass ejections and the conflicting radio and x-ray observations of intracluster shocks. These effects will likely need to be included in fluid modeling to accurately predict shock evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-living Equilibria in Kinetic Astrophysical Plasma Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2408.02656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Turbulence in classical fluids is characterized by persistent structures that emerge from the chaotic landscape.

Inspired by the Harris pinch model for inhomogeneous equilibria, we describe these metastable solutions with a self-consistent kinetic model in a cylindrical coordinate system centered on a representative vortex, starting from an explicit form of the particle velocity distribution function. Such new equilibria can be simplified to a Gold-Hoyle solution of the modified force-free state. Turbulence is mediated by the long-living structures, accompanied by transients in which such vortices merge and form self-similarly new metastable equilibria. This process can be relevant to the comprehension of various astrophysical phenomena, going from the formation of plasmoids in the vicinity of massive compact objects to the emergence of coherent structures in the heliosphere.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">74.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05687" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the competition between the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in light of the multimessenger observations of neutron stars</a><span class="id">[2408.05687]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We extend the parity doublet model for hadronic matter and study the possible presence of quark matter inside the cores of neutron stars with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Considering the uncertainties of the QCD phase diagram and the location of the critical endpoint, we aim to explore the competition between the chiral phase transition and the deconfinement phase transition systematically, regulated by the vacuum pressure $-B$ in the NJL model. Employing a Maxwell construction, a sharp first-order deconfinement phase transition is implemented combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase and the NJL model for the high-energy quark phase. The position of the chiral phase transition is obtained from the NJL model self-consistently. We find stable neutron stars with a quark core within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. The observations suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600$ MeV in the parity doublet model and a larger split between the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions while assuming the first-order deconfinement phase transition. The maximum mass of the hybrid star that we obtain is $\sim 2.2 M_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Supercooled Audible Axions</a><span class="id">[2504.05386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the audible axion mechanism, axion-like particles source primordial gravitational waves via their coupling to a dark Abelian gauge field. The original setup, however, relies on a large axion decay constant and coupling to produce sizable signals. In this article, we show that delaying the onset of axion oscillations opens up the testable parameter space and reduces the required coupling to $\alpha \gtrsim 1$. Furthermore, we investigate the emission of gravitational waves via the axion coupling to the Standard Model photon in the presence of Schwinger pair production, generating a strong signal in the $\mu$Hz or ultra-high frequency range. Cosmological constraints and gravitational wave projections are provided for both scenarios.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From Capture to Collapse: Revisiting Black Hole formation by Fermionic Asymmetric Dark Matter in Neutron Stars</a><span class="id">[2507.22881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fermionic asymmetric dark matter (ADM) can be captured in neutron stars (NSs) via scatterings with the star constituents. The absence of dark matter annihilation due to its asymmetric nature leads to ADM accumulation in the NS core, potentially reaching densities sufficient to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit and trigger its gravitational collapse into a black hole (BH), eventually consuming the NS from within. Therefore, the existence and observation of old neutron stars provide a means to constrain the properties of ADM. We revisit previous constraints on the mass and scattering cross section off neutrons of fermionic ADM across a class of models. We critically examine common simplifying approximations used in the literature to derive these limits. Our analysis includes improved treatments of dark matter capture, thermalization, BH formation, accretion, and evaporation. We find that previous results can be relaxed by a few orders of magnitude once these effects are properly accounted for.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on cosmological parameters and CMB first acoustic peak in conformal Killing gravity</a><span class="id">[2508.02603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In the frame of conformal Killing gravity cosmology, we performed a Bayesian analysis on two different datasets of Baryon Acoustic oscillations (DESI and SDSS DR16), two datasets of SNeIa (Pantheon+ and Union3), and using the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Planck likelihood. The results for $H_0$ and $\Omega_M$ in a spatially flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) background are consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We obtain a non-negligible negative value for the novel density of dark sector, $\Omega_D$, and its relevance in the evolution of the cosmological observables, thus finding quantitatively what its contribution is on real data to match the standard scenario. The results confirm the dynamical character of dark energy. We also calculate the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and the present time dark energy equation of state parameter $w_0$: the latter belongs to the quintessence regime. The evaluation of the first acoustic peak of CMB places it near to the best value provided by the Planck collaboration. In this scenario, we can conclude that late time and early time data can be successfully matched under the same standard.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09776" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extraction of neutron-capture cross sections on $^{92}$Zr using the charge-exchange Oslo method</a><span class="id">[2509.09776]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The $^{93}$Nb($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction at 115 MeV/u was studied to demonstrate that nuclear level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength functions can be extracted from charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies using the Oslo technique. The matrix of excitation energy in $^{93}$Zr, reconstructed from the ($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction, versus the energy of $\gamma$ rays emitted by the excited $^{93}$Zr nuclei, was obtained in an experiment with the S800 Spectrograph operated in coincidence with the GRETINA $\gamma$-ray detector. The extracted level density and $\gamma$-ray strength function obtained by applying the Oslo method to this matrix were used to estimate the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section by combining the new results with other experimental data and theoretical calculations for $E$1 and $M$1 strength functions at higher energies. Good agreement with direct measurements of the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section was found. The contribution from the upbend in the extracted $\gamma$-ray strength function was important to achieve the consistency as the neutron-capture cross section without this contribution is significantly below the direct measurements otherwise. Since charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies have long been used for extracting Gamow-Teller strengths, the successful demonstration of the charge-exchange Oslo method enables experiments in which ($n$,$\gamma$) cross sections and Gamow-Teller strengths can be measured simultaneously, which is of benefit for astrophysical studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20557" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Natural inflation in Palatini $F(R)$</a><span class="id">[2511.20557]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>$F(R)$ Palatini gravity provides a robust framework for constructing viable inflationary potentials.
