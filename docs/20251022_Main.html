General relativistic radiative transfer is employed to compute synchrotron emission from thermal electrons and generate horizon-scale images. For the RIAF model, we analyze the dependence of image morphology on the deformation parameter, observing frequency, and flow dynamics. The photon ring and central dark region expand with increasing deformation parameter, with brightness asymmetries arising at high inclinations and depending on flow dynamics and emission anisotropy. The BAAF disk produces narrower rings and darker centers, while polarization patterns trace the brightness distribution and vary with viewing angle and deformation, revealing spacetime structure. These results demonstrate that intensity and polarization in thick-disk models provide probes of KZ black holes and near-horizon accretion physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sub-Snowline Formation of Gas-Giant Planets in Binary Systems</a><span class="id">[2510.17955]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Giant planets are thought to build their cores beyond the snow line, where water ice solids catalyze efficient planetary core growth \citep{Pollack1996, Armitage2024}. In close binary star systems, however, the companion star's gravity shrinks the region where orbits are long-term stable \citep[]{Holman1999}, effectively excluding the zone where giants should form. Nevertheless, here we show that such systems exist and are not rare. Among 393 binary systems with measured orbits and circumstellar gas giants, we identify 19 for which the snowline region is unstable. The distribution of their metallicities and eccentricities is consistent with the background population, making a capture origin or enhanced solids abundance unlikely causes for their formation. Instead, we show that the sub-snowline formation paradox can be resolved by the tidal torque from the companion, which truncates the protoplanetary disk and creates a pressure bump and effective dust trap that facilitates the formation of gas giants. Using this model, we can successfully predict the observed locations of gas giants from their host binary properties. Moreover, the main inconsistent outliers from these predictions are found to be evolved stellar systems (white dwarfs or red-giant stars), further supporting the model and pointing to these being second-generation planets. Our results have therefore key implications for understanding planet formation processes and provide observational support for sub-snowline gas-giant formation and the role of trap-dusts in their formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17957" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Silent Majority: The Interacting Post-Common-Envelope Binaries Underlying Cataclysmic Variables</a><span class="id">[2510.17957]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the orbital period distribution of post-common-envelope white-dwarf-main-sequence (WDMS) binaries by cross-matching the new spectroscopic Gaia DR3 WDMS catalog with TESS light curves, and applying a uniform periodicity search and vetting pipeline. We identify 107 periodic systems, including 74 eclipsing binaries (32 new) and 33 binaries exhibiting only sinusoidal variations. Injection-recovery tests and a forward detectability model yield a completeness-corrected distribution that is well-described by a two-component function: a log-period Gaussian peaking at $P_{\rm orb} \approx 4.1 $ h with $\sigma \approx 1.8$ h, plus a rising component that begins near $P_{\rm orb}\approx12.9$ h. We refer to this extended component as the long-period tail. It consists exclusively of detached non-interacting post-common-envelope binaries (PCEBs) that likely emerged from the common envelope and have not yet initiated mass transfer. In contrast, the short-period Gaussian is dominated by interacting or near-contact systems (including 22 known cataclysmic variables), consistent with high Roche-lobe filling factors. From the completeness-corrected distribution we infer that $29.8\%\pm4.5\%$ of the spatially unresolved WDMSs in our parent catalog are close PCEBs. Binary population synthesis models with high common-envelope efficiencies overproduce long-period systems and fail to reproduce the sharp peak, whereas lower efficiencies ($\alpha\lambda \leq 0.3$) match the peak more closely, yet still underpredict the tail. Our results hint at a large, currently under-classified reservoir of pre-cataclysmic variables and weakly accreting binaries, and provide new constraints on common-envelope physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17958" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Attributing the O'Connell effect in contact binaries to a cooling mass-transfer stream</a><span class="id">[2510.17958]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Contact binaries are very short-period systems that are continuously interacting by transferring mass and energy. Obtaining large, statistical samples of contact binaries from photometric surveys can put valuable constraints on the various processes involved in their evolution. Modeling those systems however present some challenges. In some contact-binary light curves, the O'Connell effect is visible, where the maxima at both quarter phases are unequal. In the literature, this effect is typically attributed to magnetic spots on the surface of the binary. In this work, we model contact-binary surfaces using PHOEBE, and include a parametric prescription for a lateral mass- and energy-transfer stream that travels from the hotter primary to the cooler secondary. We allow this stream to have a variable heat capacity. We fit a system from the Kepler sample with a strong O'Connell effect, and show that a low-heat capacity stream can explain the unequal maxima. This suggests that, in such systems, surface flows can play a significant role in transferring heat between components. Our methods can be used on larger samples of contact binaries from OGLE, Kepler, or TESS to advance our understanding of contact binary structure and evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17963" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Contact-binary evolution with energy transfer and saturated magnetic braking</a><span class="id">[2510.17963]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The evolution of low-mass contact binaries is influenced by angular-momentum loss, mass and energy transfer, and the nuclear evolution of the components. They have periods shorter than one day, and we expect their period evolution to be dominated by magnetic braking. Evidence for saturated magnetic braking was presented by studying the period distribution of detached eclipsing binaries. This means the strength of magnetic braking likely does not cause a steep period-shrinking relation derived from the widely used Skumanich law. We find further evidence for saturated magnetic braking by considering evolutionary models of low-mass contact binaries. We also show that energy transfer must play an important role over a wide parameter range in producing the observed low mass ratios of contact binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking for Companionship: Radial Velocity Follow-Up of Lithium-Rich Giants with ESPRESSO</a><span class="id">[2510.17966]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Lithium-rich red giants have been a long-standing mystery in stellar astrophysics. A leading theory to explain these chemically peculiar and rare objects is interactions with a close companion. To investigate their companion fraction, we collected high-resolution spectra of 33 Li-rich red giants using ESPRESSO, and used The Joker constrain their orbital parameters. We find an overall companion rate of $27\%$ (9/33). Secondary masses reveal one planetary companion ($ M\sin i \approx 7 \; \rm M_{Jup}$), three brown dwarfs ($ M\sin i=30-33 \; \rm M_{Jup}$), and five stellar-mass companions ($M\sin i= 0.2-0.8 \;\rm M_\odot$). Our findings suggest that Li-rich red giants with lower lithium abundance ($\rm A(Li) \approx 1.5 \; dex$) tend to be in binaries as compared to those with higher lithium abundance, and Li-rich red giants with $\log g = 2-3 \rm \; dex$ have a higher companion rate than those outside of this range. We offer two potential formation mechanisms of our Li-rich sample: (i) the progenitor mass of stellar mass companions suggest that these objects were potentially lithium-producing, intermediate-mass AGB stars; (ii) the sub-stellar companions were initially in multi-planet systems, but dynamical instability caused the tidal dissipation of close-in planets thereby enhancing the red giant in lithium. Extended baselines and dedicated follow-up with Gaia DR4 astrometry are required to confirm the orbital parameters of our systems and distinguish between mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17970" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating the mysterious nature of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u through deep XMM-Newton observations</a><span class="id">[2510.17970]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>1LHAASO J1740+0948u is a very-high-energy (VHE) source reported by LHAASO, with no counterpart at other wavelengths. It is located at 0.2° from PSR J1740+1000, a radio and gamma-ray pulsar placed well above the Galactic plane, which displays an X-ray tail. Despite the offset, the association between the two sources is likely. We aim to study the diffuse X-ray emission around PSR J1740+1000 and its tail to investigate the origin of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u through a multi-wavelength SED fitting, testing different scenarios. We analysed  500 ks of XMM-Newton observations and studied for the first time the diffuse emission around the pulsar. We also analysed the tail and how its emission evolves as a function of distance. We then performed a fit of the SED, including the spectrum of 1LHAASO J1740+0948u and the X-ray data obtained from either the analysis of the tail or the diffuse emission, to understand whether one of the two X-ray sources could be related to the TeV emission and attempt a source classification. The diffuse X-ray emission analysis resulted in upper limits in the 0.5-10 keV range. The tail is best fitted with a power law with $\Gamma=1.76\pm0.06$ in 0.5-8 keV, with no significant detection of spectral variations with distance. We do not find a good SED fit that can explain both the X-ray tail and the LHAASO spectrum with reasonable parameters, suggesting that the TeV emission likely comes from an older X-ray-faint electron population. We then performed an SED fitting of the VHE spectrum combined with the upper limits on the diffuse emission, constraining the magnetic field to be as low as $B\leq1.2 \mu$G. We suggest that 1LHAASO J1740+0948u could represent either the relic PWN of PSR J1740+1000 or its pulsar halo. Our energy density results hint at a halo-like nature for 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, but deeper multi-wavelength observations are required to confirm this hypothesis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17973" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fragmentation Cross Sections for the Understanding of Cosmic-Ray Transport in the Galaxy: Results and Prospects from NA61/SHINE</a><span class="id">[2510.17973]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate measurements of cosmic-ray fragmentation cross sections are essential for maximizing the physics potential of precise measurements of secondary and primary cosmic-ray fluxes from current balloon and space-borne experiments. NA61/SHINE, operating at the CERN SPS H2 beamline, is uniquely suited to studying these interactions at energies above 10 GeV/c per nucleon. In this contribution, we present the fragmentation cross sections for the breakup of carbon into $^{10}$B, $^{11}$B and $^{11}$C at 13.5 GeV/c per nucleon that are needed for interpreting the cosmic-ray boron-to-carbon ratio. These results are based on data from a pilot run conducted in 2018. We also give an overview of the high-statistics data-taking campaign in 2024, which covered projectile nuclei from lithium to silicon. With over 40 million recorded beam triggers, this data set will enable the reconstruction of the full reaction network required to study light secondary cosmic rays. Furthermore, we report on data collected in 2025 with a primary oxygen beam at 150 GeV/c per nucleon, aimed at verifying the expected flattening of fragmentation cross sections at high energies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growth of Structure in Multi-species Wave Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2510.17977]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explore the growth of structure in multi-species wave (and particle) dark matter. We derive the evolution of the power spectrum of total density contrasts for an arbitrary number of component species, density fractions, and initial field power spectra.

Our framework includes cold and warm wave dark matter, which can give rise to significant intrinsic Poisson-like density fluctuations along with scale-dependent evolution connected to the free-streaming and Jeans scales. Such dark matter components could be globally or locally misaligned scalar fields as well as multi-component fields with spin $&gt;0$.

These objects can be used to infer the composition of exoplanetary material and identify evidence for key geological processes. However, the white dwarf atmospheric physics distorts the inferred material composition away from the true composition, mainly through differential atomic diffusion of the accreted metals. Correcting for this effect is essential, but is dependent on various physical assumptions associated with the white dwarf itself. We first focus on the effect of assumptions related to convective overshoot and thermohaline mixing on the atomic diffusion timescales. For white dwarfs with H-dominated atmospheres between 12000 K and 18000 K, we find that including a complete treatment of convective overshoot decreases the inferred Fe and O abundances in accreted material. For these white dwarfs, we also find that including thermohaline mixing decreases Fe and O abundances. For He-dominated systems, the effect of convective overshoot is comparatively minor. We then explore the overall effect of other physical assumptions by comparing publicly available grids of diffusion timescales. We find that the choice of model grid can have a large impact for white dwarfs with He-dominated atmospheres, notably on the inferred core to mantle ratio of accreted material. We identify several systems for which the geological interpretation is robust against these systematics. We also present a `discrepancy metric' which can be used to estimate the potential impact of changing the stellar physics without requiring detailed modelling.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Piling up in the darkness: Features of the BBH mass distribution from isolated binaries</a><span class="id">[2510.17987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>After the third LIGO–Virgo–KAGRA observing run, the number of detected binary black hole (BBH) mergers became sufficient to identify statistical features of the population. We explore how different prescriptions for the final fate of massive stars and key binary-evolution processes shape isolated binaries and their remnants. Using \textsc{sevn}, we evolved $10^{7}$ binaries across 15 metallicities, 3 core-collapse supernova models, 4 PPISN models, and 6 common-envelope (CE) prescriptions, for a total of 990 runs ($9.9 \times 10^{9}$ systems). Both single- and binary-star physics shape the BH mass distribution: single-star processes control the high-mass tail ($M_{\rm BH} \geq 45M_{\odot}$), while binary evolution produces pile-ups in specific intervals. In particular, the bump at $\sim 35 M_{\odot}$, often attributed to PPISNe, also emerges from binaries evolving only through stable mass transfer, without CE. Finally, we test a top-heavy IMF, finding it boosts merger numbers and alters the abundance of systems with a given primary BH mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic shear with one component and its application to future radio surveys</a><span class="id">[2510.18011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new approach to measuring cosmic shear: the one-component Kinematic Lensing (KL) method. This technique provides a simplified implementation of KL that reduces shape noise in weak lensing (WL) by combining kinematic information with imaging data, while requiring less observational effort than the full two-component KL. We perform simulated likelihood analyses to assess the performance of the one-component KL and demonstrate its applicability to future radio surveys. Our forecasts indicate that, for radio surveys, the one-component KL is not yet competitive with traditional WL due to the shallow redshift distribution of HI-selected galaxies. However, when applying this method to deeper spectroscopic surveys with stronger emission lines, the one-component KL approach could surpass WL in constraining power, offering a promising and efficient pathway for future shear analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18044" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4 Second and 169 Second Rotation of Two Isolated, Ultramassive, Strongly Magnetic White Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2510.18044]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Photometric variability in massive, magnetic white dwarfs (WDs) on the timescales of less than a few hours is oft interpreted as being due to magnetic spots on the surface of a rotating star. Increasingly, numbers of these short period variables are being discovered with the continued growth of time-domain astronomy, testing theories of magnetic white dwarf formation and angular momentum evolution. We present the detection of extremely rapid rotation in the WDs SDSS J1557+0411 and PG 1312+099, with periods of 168.94 s and 83.72 s, respectively. We consider other possible causes of the monoperiodic photometric variability, including binarity (eclipses and ellipsoidal variations) and asteroseismic pulsations. Though these cannot be ruled out with the existing data, these alternative explanations seem unlikely. SDSS J1557+0411 was predicted to be a rapidly rotating oxygen-neon core WD by Camisassa et al. (2022), a prediction borne out at least in part by our observations. PG 1312+099 was previously observed via polarimetry to be rotating with a period of  5.4 h; we propose that this object may be an unresolved double degenerate system.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18065" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can the CMB be Odd? Effect of a Parity-Violating Matter 4-Point Function on the Low-$\ell$ CMB Trispectrum</a><span class="id">[2510.18065]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Here we explore from a theoretical perspective the sensitivity of the primary CMB anisotropy trispectrum to parity violation (PV) in large-scale structure (LSS). We focus on the Sachs-Wolfe term, which dominates at $\ell &lt; 40$, after which the Doppler term takes over. We consider a model where the PV is only present out to some maximal scale $R$ of order a few hundred Mpc/$h$, consistent with what recent LSS 4PCF measurements seem to indicate. We find that the odd CMB trispectrum must be suppressed by at least one factor of $R/\chi_*$$\simeq$1\%, with $\chi_*$ the distance to last scattering, relative to the input matter 4PCF. Thus, a non-detection of PV in the CMB trispectrum is \textit{not necessarily inconsistent} with a genuine detection of PV in the LSS 4PCF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clouds as the driver of variability and colour changes in brown dwarf atmospheres</a><span class="id">[2510.18090]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Brown dwarfs are massive, giant exoplanet analogues subject to variability and colour changes, known as the L/T transition, fundamental for their thermal evolution. The drivers of the L/T transition remain elusive, with atmospheric circulations and/or clouds usually suggested as potential mechanisms. Using a three-dimensional Global Climate Model including cloud formation, transport and multi-wavelength radiative effects, we show that clouds play a major role in shaping the atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs. Cloud radiative effect, which triggers atmospheric convection, leads to spectral, spatial, and temporal variability in the modelled brown dwarfs, in agreement with the observed variability and L/T transition. Low latitudes are subject to sustained wave activity, whereas eddies dominate higher latitudes. Our results highlight that the role of clouds as a driver of atmospheric dynamics and climate, well known for giant exoplanets, extends to all sub-stellar bodies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18098" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Atmospheric Composition of Sub-Neptune K2-18 b and Implications for its Formation</a><span class="id">[2510.18098]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Unlocking the atmospheres of sub-Neptunes is among JWST's major achievements, yet such observations demand complex analyses that strongly affect interpretations. We present an independent reanalysis of the original JWST transmission spectrum of K2-18 b, to assess the robustness of previously claimed detections, explore the parameter space, and implications for its formation. The observations were reduced using a combination of public and customized pipelines producing a total of 12 different versions of the transmission spectrum by varying: spectral binning, limb-darkening, and a novel correction for the occulted stellar spot. We then performed atmospheric retrievals using TauREx 3, comparing models of varying complexity, robustly detecting CH$_4$ (3-4$\sigma$) across all configurations. The evidence for CO$_2$ is weaker and highly model-dependent. The tentative detection of dimethyl sulphide (DMS) vanishes in our most comprehensive retrieval models. We find that correcting the stellar spot in the NIRISS transit is a critical step, introducing a uniform offset that primarily drives the inference of a lower mean molecular weight atmosphere. Furthermore, the assumed complexity of the retrieval model itself introduces significant biases; including more molecules systematically increases the retrieved CH$_4$ abundance and atmospheric mean molecular weight, even for species without spectral features. The data are consistent with a hydrogen-rich atmosphere with an elevated O and an even more elevated C abundance, leading to a super-solar C/O. We show that the physical properties of the system planets K2-18 c, and K2-18 b are consistent with those expected by the in situ formation theory of Inside-Out Planet Formation (IOPF), interior to the carbon &quot;soot&quot; line, where an elevated C/O ratio of a primordial atmosphere is expected to be inherited from the protoplanetary disk.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on the Correlation of IceCube Neutrinos with Tracers of Large-Scale Structure</a><span class="id">[2510.18119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The IceCube Neutrino Observatory has observed extragalactic astrophysical neutrinos with an apparently isotropic distribution. Only a small fraction of the observed astrophysical neutrinos can be explained by known sources. Neutrino production is thought to occur in energetic environments that are ultimately powered by the gravitational collapse of dense regions of the large-scale mass distribution in the universe. Whatever their identity, neutrino sources likely trace this large-scale mass distribution. The clustering of neutrinos with a tracer of the large-scale structure may provide insight into the distribution of neutrino sources with respect to redshift and the identity of neutrino sources. We implement a two-point angular cross-correlation of the Northern sky track events with an infrared galaxy catalog derived from WISE and 2MASS source catalogs that trace the nearby large-scale structure. No statistically significant correlation is found between the neutrinos and this infrared galaxy catalog. We find that &lt;  54% of the diffuse muon neutrino flux can be attributed to sources correlated with the galaxy catalog with 90% confidence. Additionally, when assuming that the neutrino source comoving density evolves following a power-law in redshift, $dN_s/dV \propto (1+z)^{k}$, we find that sources with negative evolution, in particular k &lt; -1.75, are disfavored at the 90% confidence level</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18124" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The s process in massive stars, a benchmark for neutron capture reaction rates</a><span class="id">[2510.18124]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A clear definition of the contribution from the slow neutron-capture process (s process) to the solar abundances between Fe and the Sr-Zr region is a crucial challenge for nuclear astrophysics. Robust s-process predictions are necessary to disentangle the contribution from other stellar processes producing elements in the same mass region. Nuclear uncertainties are affecting s-process calculations, but most of the needed nuclear input are accessible to present nuclear experiments or they will be in the near future. Neutron-capture rates have a great impact on the s process in massive stars, which is a fundamental source for the solar abundances of the lighter s-process elements heavier than Fe (weak s-process component). In this work we present a new nuclear sensitivity study to explore the impact on the s process in massive stars of 86 neutron-capture rates, including all the reactions between C and Si and between Fe and Zr. We derive the impact of the rates at the end of the He-burning core and at the end of the C-burning shell, where the $^{22}$Ne($\alpha$,n)$^{25}$Mg reaction is is the main neutron source. We confirm the relevance of the light isotopes capturing neutrons in competition with the Fe seeds as a crucial feature of the s process in massive stars. For heavy isotopes we study the propagation of the neutron-capture uncertainties, finding a clear difference of the impact of Fe and Co isotope rates with respect to the rates of heavier stable isotopes. The local uncertainty propagation due to the neutron-capture rates at the s-process branching points is also considered, discussing the example of $^{85}$Kr. The complete results of our study for all the 86 neutron-capture rates are available online.

We interpret the plasma cloud as an eruptive filament directly heated in the corona via magnetic reconnection that occurs when a rising filament interacts with this eruptive filament. Previous disk-integrated solar soft X-ray spectral measurements of this flare using the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer CubeSat-1 (MinXSS-1) inferred coronal abundances at the flare peak. However, MinXSS synthetic spectra from AIA observations show that the plasma cloud is too tenuous to be detected in MinXSS-1 and thus the coronal abundances of low FIP elements must be in emission from the flare loops. Furthermore, we demonstrate the non-negligible differences in differential emission measures (DEMs) between coronal and photospheric abundance models. These results highlight the importance of instruments capable of simultaneous spectral and spatial diagnostics during large-scale solar events. Such coordinated measurements would enable more accurate thermal and compositional analyses and deeper insight into the underlying physical mechanisms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electron Acceleration via Lower-Hybrid Drift Instability in Astrophysical Plasmas: Dependence on Plasma Beta and Suprathermal Electron Distributions</a><span class="id">[2510.18182]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Density inhomogeneities are ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas, particularly at magnetic reconnection sites, shock fronts, and within compressible turbulence. The gradients associated with these inhomogeneous plasma regions serve as free energy sources that can drive plasma instabilities, including the lower-hybrid drift instability (LHDI). Notably, lower-hybrid waves are frequently observed in magnetized space plasma environments, such as Earth's magnetotail and magnetopause. Previous studies have primarily focused on modeling particle acceleration via LHDI in these regions using a quasilinear approach. This study expands the investigation of LHDI to a broader range of environments, spanning weakly to strongly magnetized media, including interplanetary, interstellar, intergalactic, and intracluster plasmas. To explore the applicability of LHDI in various astrophysical settings, we employ two key parameters: (1) plasma magnetization, characterized by the plasma beta parameter, and (2) the spectral slope of suprathermal electrons following a power-law distribution. Using a quasilinear model, we determine the critical values of plasma beta and spectral slope that enable efficient electron acceleration via LHDI by comparing the rate of growth of instability and the damping rate of the resulting fluctuations. We further analyze the time evolution of the electron distribution function to confirm these critical conditions. Our results indicate that electron acceleration is generally most efficient in low-beta plasmas ($\beta &lt; 1$). However, the presence of suprathermal electrons significantly enhances electron acceleration via LHDI, even in high-beta plasmas ($\beta &gt; 1$). Finally, we discuss the astrophysical implications of our findings, highlighting the role of LHDI in electron acceleration across diverse plasma environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Origin of Self-similar FRED Profiles in Gamma-Ray Bursts Pulses</a><span class="id">[2510.18207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To understand the physical mechanisms underlying the prompt emission of gamma-ray bursts (GRB), single FRED (Fast-Rise-Exponential-Decay) profile GRBs serve as an ideal sample, as they origin from single epoch central engine activity.

Here we propose a physical model which includes radiation locations sequentially triggered by propagating magnetic perturbations. It naturally explains all observed properties of these GRBs, including the self-similar FRED profile, multi-band aligned subpulses, hard-to-soft spectral evolution, local intensity tracking, and increasing subpulse durations. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the duration of these GRBs is not reflecting the activity timescale of the central engine, reconciling recent challenges to the traditional merger-short/collapsar-long dichotomy of GRBs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sympathetic Eruption of Two Filaments and Associated Solar Coronal Jet</a><span class="id">[2510.18294]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Combining the high-quality observations from the {\it Solar Dynamics Observatory} (SDO), the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG), and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE), we report a solar coronal jet triggered by the sympathetic eruption of two filaments on 2024 January 11. Initially, the western segment of an active region filament erupted. The erupting plasma propagated eastward, approximately along the filament's axis. This eruption perturbed the magnetic field of a second filament situated near its eastern footpoint, the second filament then erupted sympathetically about one hour later. The eruption of the second filament is a failed one, with the majority of the filament material falling back after the initial lifting. Although no GOES flare accompanied these filament eruptions, distinct brightenings were observed following each eruption. The second eruption produced a large coronal jet, which propagated along a bent trajectory with an apparent deflection angle of approximately 90 degrees. No clear evidence of magnetic reconnection was detected at the deflection site, thus we suspect that the jet may have traveled along an S-shaped trans-equatorial loop and shown a curved trajectory. This event exhibits multiple phenomena: partial filament eruption, failed filament eruption, sympathetic filament eruption, jet initiation by filament eruption, and apparently deflected jet propagation. Collectively, these observations highlight the complexity and diversity of solar activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18301" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Growth of the Central Black Holes in Quasi-stars</a><span class="id">[2510.18301]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations by JWST have confirmed the presence of supermassive black holes (BHs) at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, lending support to scenarios in which BHs experience rapid growth through intense gas accretion. Here we investigate the growth of a BH embedded at the center of a quasi-star, a theoretically predicted object formed via direct collapse. In a quasi-star, the central BH accretes at a highly super-Eddington rate, while the excess energy is transported outward by convection and radiated at approximately the Eddington luminosity of the entire star. We employ the open-source stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} to construct quasi-star models and follow the time-dependent growth of the central BH under different prescriptions for the accretion rate at the inner boundary $R_i$, and further considering the effect of winds. For the case $R_i=NR_{\rm B}$, where $N$ is a constant and $R_{\rm B}$ is the Bondi radius corresponding to the mass of the BH and the gas infalling onto it, our models terminate when the BH mass reaches a critical value $M_{\mathrm{crit}}(N)=c_{s,i}^3/(12\sqrt{N^3G^3\pi\rho_i})$ (where $c_{s,i}$ and $\rho_i$ are the sound speed and density at $R_i$, respectively), a limit we also derive analytically. Models that feature an inner convective region matched to an outer adiabatic envelope exhibit BH growth up to approximately $M_{\mathrm{BH}}/M_\star\simeq 0.33$, largely independent of the stellar mass $M_\star$ itself. This ratio is approximately preserved even in the presence of mass loss, as several properties of the model are independent of the quasi-star's total mass.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18312" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ Forecasts and the search for primordial intermittent non-Gaussianity</a><span class="id">[2510.18312]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the $\mathtt{WebSky}$ $\mathrm{[CII]}$ line-intensity mock maps and forecast the capabilities of upcoming wide-field submillimeter-wave surveys of cosmological $\mathrm{[CII]}$ emission from the epoch of reionization (EoR).

X-ray flares, observed during the afterglow phase, are generally believed to originate from the prolonged activity of the central engine, though direct evidence has been scarce. In this study, we present a comprehensive statistical analysis of X-ray flares from 315 GRBs observed by the Swift/X-ray Telescope over nearly two decades. We categorize flares into prompt flares (occurring during the prompt emission phase) and afterglow flares and compare their temporal and luminosity properties. Our analysis reveals that both types of flares exhibit similar morphological characteristics, with prompt flares being brighter and occurring earlier than afterglow flares. We find strong correlations between flare parameters, such as peak time, duration, and luminosity, which follow consistent patterns across both flare types. These findings suggest that X-ray flares, regardless of their timing, share a common origin in the central engine's activity. Our results imply that the central engine's activity duration extends beyond the prompt gamma-ray emission phase, highlighting the importance of considering X-ray flares when studying GRB progenitors and central engine properties. This work provides robust statistical evidence supporting the central engine origin of X-ray flares and underscores the need for future observations with missions like the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor and Einstein Probe to further elucidate the nature of GRB central engines.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The implications of inflation for the last ACT</a><span class="id">[2510.18320]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We explored a parameterized slow-roll inflationary model within the $\Lambda$CDM framework, utilizing a combination of data from Planck 2018, ACT DR6, DESI DR2, and BICEP/Keck 2018 (P-ACT-LB-BK18).

This paper aims to investigate the acceleration during planetary migration in detail using numerical simulations, delving deeper into the early solar system's preserved information. We confirm that planetary migration is a positive feedback process: the faster the migration, the more efficient the consumption of planetesimals; once the migration slows down, Neptune clears the surrounding space, making further migration more difficult to sustain. Quantitatively, a tenfold increase in migration rate corresponds to an approximately 30% reduction in the mass of planetesimals consumed to increase per unit angular momentum of Neptune. We also find that Neptune's final position is correlated with the initial surface density of planetesimals at that location, suggesting that the disk density at 30au was approximately 0.009$M_{\oplus}/au^2$ in the early solar system. Two mechanisms that can accelerate planetary migration are identified: the first is MMR between Uranus and Neptune. Migration acceleration will be triggered whenever these two giant planets cross their major MMR. The second mechanism is the ring structure within the planetesimal disk, as the higher planetesimal density in this region can provide the material support necessary for migration acceleration. Our research indicates that Neptune in the current solar system occupies a relatively delicate position. In case Neptune crossed the 1:2 MMR with Uranus, it could have migrated to a much more distant location. Therefore, under the influence of the positive feedback mechanism, the evolution of the solar system to its current configuration might be a stochastic outcome rather than an inevitable consequence.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18495" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the influence of component orbital motion on the photometric variability of DF Tau</a><span class="id">[2510.18495]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Based on the analysis of the long-term light curve of the young binary DF Tau spanning approximately 125 years, we infer that its brightness variations are associated with changes in the accretion rate from the circumstellar protoplanetary disk onto the primary.

The relationship between the long-term brightness variations and the orbital motion of DF Tau, if present, appears to be inconsistent with theoretical predictions. Notably, similar discrepancies between theory and observations are also seen in other young binary systems. Furthermore, the source of the polarized radiation in the optical range is found to be located at a distance of $\lesssim 0.5^{\prime\prime}$ from the star, with the polarization variability showing no dependence on the orbital phase.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18505" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multi-band Photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the dwarf novae IU Leo</a><span class="id">[2510.18505]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>IU Leo was first identified as a cataclysmic variable star in 2006.

We reviewed the physical parameters of IU Leo and simulated the evolution process using a stellar evolution code MESA with $M_{1}$=0.982 $M_{\bigodot}$, $M_{2}$=0.835 $M_{\bigodot}$, and an orbital period of 0.376308 days. The evolved other parameters are basically consistent with the parameters in the literatures. Based on the quiescence Kepler Mission 2.0 light curve, the quiescence Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite light curve, and 89 Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope medium resolution spectra, we derived an orbital period of 0.376307 $\pm$ 0.000004 days, 0.3762 $\pm$ 0.0001 days, and 0.3763 days for IU Leo respectively.

We reevaluated the $^{42}$Ti($p$,$\gamma$)$^{43}$V rate by the sum of the isolated resonance contribution instead of the Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. A Monte Carlo method is used to derive the uncertainties of new rates. The nucleosynthesis simulations are performed via the NuGrid post-processing code ppn. The new rates differ from previous estimations because of using a series of updated resonance parameters and direct S-factor. Compared with the previous results from Hauser-Feshbach statistical model, which assumes compound nucleus $^{43}$V with a sufficiently high-level density in the energy region of astrophysical interest, differences exist over the entire temperature region of rp-process interest, even up to 4 orders of magnitude. Using a trajectory with a peak temperature of 1.95$\times$10$^9$ K, we perform the rp-process nucleosynthesis simulations to investigate the impact of the new rates. Our calculations show that the adoption of the new forward and reverse rates result in abundance variations for Sc and Ca by 128\% and 49\% respectively compared to the case using statistical model rates. On the other hand, the overall abundance pattern is not significantly affected. The results of using new rates also confirm that the rp-process path does not bypass the isotope $^{43}$V.

Classic pebble drift models treat volatile species individually as sublimating at their respective snowlines, although observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that ices are likely mixed; laboratory studies suggest ice mixtures can exhibit more complex sublimation behaviours, remaining trapped beyond their nominal sublimation temperatures. We present the first model that couples pebble growth and drift with CO entrapment inside water ice - preventing a fraction (up to  60%) of the CO from sublimating at its snowline, instead desorbing via volcanic desorption at the water crystallisation front, at 130K. Our models show that CO entrapment will significantly impact the carbon and oxygen distributions, enhancing the gas-phase C/O and C/H inside the water snowline by up to a factor of 10 over 1 Myr and a factor of a few around the CO2 snowline; O/H is also increased around the CO2 snowline, but is water-dominated in the inner disc. Entrapment therefore provides a means of introducing more carbon to the inner disc whilst retaining a large amount of water. We discuss connections to planet formation, noting that CO entrapment can increase the gas-phase heavy element content around the water snowline by up to 150%. We also consider links to JWST observations and highlight the importance of entrapment for pebble drift models to accurately model disc composition.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">34.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18595" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J-PAS: forecast on the primordial power spectrum reconstruction</a><span class="id">[2510.18595]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the capability of the J-PAS survey to constrain the primordial power spectrum using a non-parametric Bayesian method.

The analysis reveals OJ 287's consistent flux-dependent transitional spectral behavior: quiescent states show hard X-ray spectra dominated by inverse Compton emission; intermediate states exhibit contributions from both inverse Compton and synchrotron components with moderately hard spectra; flaring events are characterized by predominantly synchrotron emission, resulting in soft X-ray spectra.

As a result of its unique high-altitude orbit, instruments onboard are capable of obtaining a full geographic and local time coverage of the Martian atmosphere every 9-10 Martian days, approximately  5° in solar longitude (LS). This enables investigations of the diurnal variation of the current climate on Mars on a planetary scale without significant local time (LT) gaps or confusions from correlated seasonal variations. Here, we present the results of diurnal temperature variations and thermal tides in the Martian atmosphere using temperature profiles retrieved from the Emirates Mars InfraRed Spectrometer (EMIRS) observations. The data during the primary mission is included, covering an entire Martian Year (MY) starting from MY 36 LS = 49°. The diurnal temperature patterns suggest a dominant diurnal tide in most seasons, while the semi-diurnal tide presents a similar amplitude near perihelion. The seasonal variation of the diurnal tide latitudinal distribution is well explained by the total vorticity due to zonal wind, while that of the semi-diurnal tide following both dust and water ice clouds, and the ter-diurnal tide following the dust only.

Our technical goal is to establish a multimodel sparse sampled ensemble approach for coherently exploring large unconstrained parameter spaces typical in exoplanet science. Our science goal is to determine relationships that connect observations to the underlying climate across a large parameter space of atmospheric compositions for TRAPPIST-1 e. We consider atmospheric compositions of N2, CO2, CH4, and H2O, with water clouds and photochemical hazes. We use a 1D photochemical model, a 3D climate model, and a transmission spectral model, filtered through a quasi-Monte Carlo sparse sampling approach applied across atmospheric compositions. While clouds and hazes have significant effects on the transmission spectra, CO2 and CH4 can be potentially detected in &lt;10 transits for certain compositional and climate states. Colder climates have better prospects for characterization, due to being relatively dry and having fewer clouds, permitting transmission observations to probe more deeply into their atmospheres. CH4 volume mixing ratios of &gt;$10^{-3}$ trigger strong antigreenhouse cooling, where near-IR absorption simultaneously creates an inversion in the stratosphere and reduces the stellar radiation reaching the planet surface. In such cases, interpreting the disk-averaged emission and albedo at face value can yield misleading conclusions, as here low albedo and high thermal emission are associated with cold planets.

Such universal relations are of utmost importance as they allow for the imposition of constraints on stellar properties without directly measuring them and they may also serve as a probe of General Relativity. In the present study, we investigated the possible existence of a universal relation between the binding energy of compact stars and the frequency of their non-radial oscillations. The main motivation was related to the fact that both of the aforementioned quantities might be measured in the occurrence of a supernova explosion. Interestingly, we found that there is a empirical relation between the oscillation frequency and the binding energy for both $f$ and $p_1$ modes, assuming hadronic stellar matter. The inclusion of hybrid equations of state, incorporating sharp phase transitions, was shown to result into deviations from the aforementioned quasi-universal relation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18727" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational-wave and electromagnetic detections in the context of the CosmoDC2 LSST synthetic catalog</a><span class="id">[2510.18727]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We release CosmoDC2_BCO, a synthetic catalog of gravitational-wave events and electromagnetic counterparts associated with galaxies from CosmoDC2.

Our results show that third-generation detector networks substantially increase detection rates and improve parameter estimation. Second-generation detectors, when combined with third-generation ones, significantly enhance sky localization and distance precision, particularly for BNS mergers. Assuming a simplified Target of Opportunity strategy, we estimate that an LSST-like survey, partnered with the CE+ET+LVK network at 70% duty cycle, could detect about 5000 kilonovae with GW counterparts over a 10-year period on a 16000 deg^2 footprint, predominantly from low-mass BNS mergers that produce long-lived supermassive neutron star remnants. While this is a substantial number, it represents only a small fraction of the total neutron star mergers expected to be observed by third-generation networks. These projections rely on several simplifying assumptions-including the adopted merger rate, the kilonova luminosity distribution, and the configuration and scheduling of future surveys-which introduce notable uncertainties.

During the AdS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}&lt;0$) phase, prior to the transition redshift $z_\dagger$, reduced Hubble friction dynamically enhances the growth of perturbations; after the switch, with dS-like CC ($\Lambda_{\rm s}&gt;0$), the larger late-time expansion rate partly suppresses, but does not erase, the earlier amplification. Consequently, the ratio $P_{\Lambda_{\rm s}\rm CDM}/P_{\Lambda\rm CDM}$ exhibits a pronounced, redshift-dependent shape feature: a crest peaking at ${\sim 20-25\%}$ around ${k \simeq 1-3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ near the transition, which then migrates to larger physical scales and persists to ${z = 0}$ as a robust ${\sim 15-20\%}$ uplift at ${k \simeq 0.6-1.0\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$. These wavenumbers correspond to group/poor-cluster environments and lie within the sensitivity range of weak lensing, galaxy-galaxy lensing, cluster counts, and tSZ power, providing a concrete, falsifiable target that cannot be mimicked by a scale-independent change in $\sigma_8$ or $S_8$.

Turbulence in post-flare loops, particularly from Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (KHI), has been suggested and investigated as a mechanism for trapping and accelerating electrons in such scenarios. Starting from past results, we aim to characterize the energization process of electrons trapped in a turbulent post-flare looptop, quantifying the contributions of different acceleration mechanisms, and establishing a coherent numerical framework for describing particle energetics. We perform test-particle simulations with the guiding-centre approximation on top of a 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic model of a time-evolving post-flare coronal looptop. We implement an improved formulation of the guiding-centre equations that explicitly conserves energy, enabling a consistent analysis of electron acceleration in the turbulent plasma. We find that, in the plasma turbulence inside the looptop, electrons develop suprathermal energy distributions with tails compatible with hard X-ray emission. The dominant energization channel arises from perpendicular gradient effects in the form of second-order Fermi-like stochastic acceleration, while curvature effects are dominant for particles on long trajectories. Statistical correlations with the measured particle pitch angle confirm that the strongest acceleration occurs for electrons trapped in bouncing motions within turbulent magnetic structures. Our results provide an understanding of how KHI-induced turbulence in coronal looptops produces and sustains populations of trapped nonthermal electrons. We dissect and clarify the relative roles of different magnetic effects and the emergence of stochastic Fermi-like energization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18752" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing cosmology with bright sirens from the CosmoDC2_BCO LSST synthetic catalog</a><span class="id">[2510.18752]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bright sirens, i.e. gravitational-wave detections of compact binary mergers with electromagnetic counterparts, provide a self-calibrated distance-redshift relation and are therefore powerful probes of cosmic expansion. Using the CosmoDC2_BCO catalog, we forecast cosmological constraints from current (LVK) and next-generation (ET, CE) detector networks, in combination with a Roman-like Type Ia supernova sample. We find that third-generation networks reach sub-percent precision on the Hubble constant within a few years, achieving 0.2% after a decade with CE+ET+LVK, while LVK remains limited to the 6% level. The LVK fifth observing run may shed light on the H_0 tension only if the inferred value falls outside the range spanned by the Planck and SH0ES determinations, which currently achieve far higher precisions. Supernovae do not directly tighten H_0 but stabilize its inference through parameter correlations and enable an absolute calibration of the supernova magnitude M_B. In dynamical dark-energy models, the joint analysis of Roman supernovae and bright sirens yields a Figure of Merit of 25 for ET+LVK and 76 for CE+ET+LVK, to be compared with the state-of-the-art DESI DR2 BAO plus DESY5 supernovae value of 56.

We study the possibility for DSA to energize particles from the thermal pool and from pre-existing cosmic rays at radiative shocks, focusing on the case of supernova remnants (SNRs). We rely on a semi-analytical description of particle acceleration at collisionless shocks in the test-particle limit, estimating the total proton and electron content from SNRs throughout the radiative phase. Our results indicate that DSA can lead to significant particle acceleration during the first few tens of kyrs of the radiative phase. Although the associated multi-wavelength emission from SNRs in the radiative phase may not be detectable with current observatories in most cases, the radiative phase is found to lead to substantial deviations from the canonical p$^{-4}$ of the test-particle limit. The hardening/steepening is due to an interplay between a growing contribution of the reaccelerated term as the SNR volume expands and the effects of adiabatic and radiative losses on trapped particles as particles are confined for a longer time. The slope of the cumulative proton and electron spectra over the SNR lifetime thus depends on the environment in which the SNR shock propagates, and on the duration of the radiative phase during which DSA can take place. Overall, DSA in the radiative phase can lead to a total electron spectrum steeper than the proton spectrum, both at SNRs from thermonuclear and core-collapse SNe. Finally, we comment on the case of young radiative SNRs (in the first month to a few years after the explosion) for which the denser environments (with mass-loss rates of $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-1} - 1$ M$_{\odot}$/yr) tend to inhibit DSA.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18782" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple shells in supernova 2023ixf support the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM)</a><span class="id">[2510.18782]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Examining the photospheric time evolution of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 2023ixf from the literature, we identify three evolutionary time periods with constant expansion velocities, which we attribute to three ejecta shells.

By analyzing the latest observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim}, we demonstrate that the observed preference for positive running ($\alpha_s$) of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ imposes significant restrictions on the parameter space of ultra slow roll scenarios (USR). This tension becomes progressively pronounced for more massive PBHs, posing substantial challenges for USR models to yield a detectable PBH abundance, especially in the mass range probed by ongoing and future gravitational-wave experiments such as LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) and the Einstein Telescope (ET). However, this discrepancy is minimal for asteroid-mass PBHs, which are still capable of feasibly constituting the entirety of dark matter (DM). To numerically probe the six-dimensional parameter space of polynomial models, we adapted a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to efficiently scan over the space of viable models. Our results further indicate that, in non-minimally coupled polynomial inflation, a viable cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is best obtained at an inflection point for which second-order slow-roll approximation is necessary for precise CMB predictions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">N-body Simulations of cosmologies with Light Massive Relics</a><span class="id">[2510.18797]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The presence of additional relativistic particles at the time of recombination can be inferred through their contribution to $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$.

Here we focus on double degenerate systems, where two WDs are interacting, and on the double detonation mechanism, where a detonation of a helium shell triggers a detonation of the carbon-oxygen core of the primary WD. We take the results from three-dimensional SN simulations of Pakmor et al 2022 ( arXiv:2203.14990 ) and carry them into the supernova remnant (SNR) phase, until 1500 yr after the explosion. We reveal signatures of the SN imprinted in the SNR morphology. We confirm the impact of a companion on the SNR: its presence induces a conical shadow in the ejecta, that is long lived. Its intersection with the shocked shell is visible in projection as a ring, an ellipse, or a bar, depending on the orientation. New, we test the case of a nested explosion model, in which the explosion of the primary induces the secondary to also explode. As the explosion of the secondary WD is weaker only the primary outer ejecta interact with the ambient medium and form the main SNR shell. The secondary inner ejecta collide with the reverse shock, which enhances the density and thus the X-ray emissivity. The composition at the points of impact is peculiar, since what is revealed are the outer layers from the inner ejecta. This effect can be probed with spatially-resolved X-ray spectroscopy of young SNRs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ever Elusive Exospheres: One Probable Detection and Two Non-Detections of Hα Transits in Young Systems</a><span class="id">[2510.18820]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gaps in the exoplanet population, such as the Neptunian Desert, point to the importance of mass-loss in sculpting the radii of close-in exoplanets.

We search for evidence of an H$\alpha$ transit in high-resolution spectra of three young planets, HD 63433b (400 Myr), DS TucAb (45 Myr), and HIP 67522b (17 Myr) using HARPS-N, Magellan-PFS, and CHIRON respectively. We validate our method by testing it on several photospheric lines less impacted by stellar variability. We find no evidence of a transit signal for HD 63433b and DS Tuc A b (3$\sigma$ limits of 0.9% and 0.3%, respectively). For HIP 67522b, we detect significant excess absorption (3.44$\pm$0.28%) aligned with the transit time, narrow compared to the stellar line, and blueshifted from the stellar rest frame. In combination, these suggest the signal is from the planet. However, stellar variation in the H$\alpha$ line over the course of the observations is comparable in size to the transit signature and the duration is shorter than the photometric transit, so this detection requires confirmation. Our findings, and other recent results in the literature, suggest that planets younger than 50 Myr are more favorable for the detection of atmospheric escape with H$\alpha$ observations, though older populations might still show escape in other diagnostics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">49.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18854" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AT2025ulz and S250818k: zooming in with the Hubble Space Telescope</a><span class="id">[2510.18854]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k.

In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce.

HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W\!\approx\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova.

We simultaneously characterize the transition in the distribution of BBH mass-ratios, effective aligned and effective precessing spins using our flexible models. From the transitions in our inferred spin and mass-ratio distributions, we find that the high-mass broad-spin sub-population has a significant fraction ($52^{+18}_{-23}\%$) of systems with mass ratios in the range $0.6-1$. This suggests that alternatives to the hypothesis of 2G+1G hierarchical systems dominating BBH formation above $\sim 40-50 M_{\odot}$ are more consistent with the GWTC-4 detection sample. By comparing with the predictions of star cluster simulations, we further show that contributions from (2G+2G) systems are not abundant enough to alleviate this discrepancy. We also demonstrate the effects of strong model assumptions on this inference, which can lead to biased astrophysical interpretation from restricted priors.

However, the presence of Galactic foregrounds poses significant challenges, possibly biasing the $r$ estimate. In this study we explore the viability of using Minkowski functionals (MFs) as a robustness test to validate a potential $r$ detection by identifying non-Gaussian features associated with foregrounds contamination. To do so, we simulate sky maps as observed by a LiteBIRD-like CMB experiment, with realistic instrumental and foregrounds modelling. The CMB $B$-mode signal is recovered through blind component separation algorithms, and the obtained (biased) value of $r$ is used to generate Gaussian realisation of CMB signal. Their MFs are then compared with those computed on maps contaminated by foreground residual left by component separation, looking for a detection of non-Gaussianity. Our results demonstrate that, with the experimental configuration considered here, MFs can not be reliably adopted as a robustness test of an eventual $r$ detection, as we find that in the majority of the cases MFs are not able to raise significant warnings about the non-Gaussianity induced by the presence of foreground residuals. In the most realistic and refined scenario we adopted, the test is able to flag non-Gaussianity in $\sim 26\%$ of the simulations, meaning that there is no warning on the biased tensor-to-scalar ratio in $\sim 74\%$ of cases. These results suggest that more advanced statistics than MFs must be considered to look for non-Gaussian signatures of foregrounds, in order to be able to perform reliable null tests in future CMB missions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generalized Perturbed Kepler Problem: Gravitational Wave Imprints from Eccentric Compact Binaries</a><span class="id">[2508.06245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Observations of astrophysical binaries may reveal departures from pure Keplerian orbits due to environmental influences, modifications to the underlying gravitational dynamics, or signatures of new physics.

Beyond an effective field theory treatment with higher-order operators, it is important to identify consistent theories with higher-curvature terms at the nonperturbative level. Two well-studied examples are $f(\mathcal{R})$ gravity and Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity. The former shares the same vacuum solutions as General Relativity, including black holes, while the latter suffers from well-posedness issues due to quadratic curvature terms in the strong-coupling regime. We show that combining these two theories leads to genuinely new phenomena beyond their simple superposition. The resulting framework falls outside Horndeski's class, as it can be recast as a gravitational theory involving two nonminimally coupled scalar fields with nontrivial mutual interactions. This construction naturally extends EdGB gravity to include arbitrary higher-curvature terms, providing a versatile setting to address fundamental questions. Focusing on quadratic and quartic corrections, we find that: (i) black holes are modified by $f(\mathcal{R})$ terms, unlike the case without Gauss-Bonnet interactions; (ii) the resulting solutions retain the qualitative nonperturbative features of EdGB black holes with certain couplings, such as a minimum mass and multiple branches; (iii) a nontrivial mechanism suppresses the divergence of the Ricci scalar in the black-hole interior; (iv) still, even with quartic corrections, the singularity structure and elliptic regions inside the horizon remain similar to those of pure EdGB gravity. This suggests that, at the nonperturbative level, the theory's ill-posedness cannot be resolved by adding individual higher-order terms. This conjecture could be tested by studying the nonlinear dynamics, which remains governed by second-order field equations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17967" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scalar fields around black hole binaries in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</a><span class="id">[2510.17967]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Light scalar particles arise naturally in many extensions of the Standard Model and are well-motivated dark matter candidates.

Furthermore, the solar plasma generates intense magnetic fields. Due to the photon-dark photon mixing, this simultaneously sources a “dark magnetic field&quot;. For sufficiently low dark photon masses, this dark magnetic field is capable of deflecting dark matter particles traversing the Sun. We found that if the dark magnetic force is sufficiently strong, the dark magnetic field becomes a wall, preventing the dark matter particles from reaching the deep core region, suppressing their reflected flux. This scenario correct the sensitivity of solar-reflected dark matter detection, offering critical insights for ground-based experiments aiming to probe dark matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultra-Strongly Self-Interacting Dark Matter: From Phenomenology to Astrophysical Observables</a><span class="id">[2510.18142]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We develop a minimal, testable framework for two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which a dominant, moderately self-interacting species coexists with an ultra-strongly self-interacting subcomponent (uSIDM). A light vector mediator induces velocity-dependent self-scattering, while early-universe dynamics - standard $2 \to 2$ annihilation supplemented by interconversion $\chi_1\chi_1 \to \chi_2\chi_2$ - determine the relic abundance analytically. From observations of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxy rotation curves, as well as strong cluster lensing, we place constraints on the microphysics parameters. From these constrained regions, we map the microphysics to effective \texttt{ETHOS} parameters and evolve the linear power spectrum in \texttt{CLASS}. We then confront the model with direct-detection constraints and place an upper bound on our parameter space. We identify a region where: (1) the SIDM dominant component attains $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m = 20 - 40~\text{cm}^{2}\text{g}^{-1}$ at dwarf velocities while satisfying cluster upper bounds $\sigma_{\rm{eff}}/m &lt; 0.13~\rm{cm}^{2}\rm{g}^{-1}$; (2) a subpercent uSIDM fraction drives accelerated gravothermal collapse in early halos, providing seeds relevant to high-redshift quasar formation and “little red dots”; and (3) the small-scale cutoff in the matter power spectrum remains consistent with Lyman-$\alpha$ and satellite counts, but exhibits non-standard features, potentially discernible with future observations. The allowed space can be organized by the mediator-to-DM mass ratio and the late-time uSIDM fraction, with a narrow window singled out by the combined cosmological and astrophysical requirements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Special Relativistic Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Based on Riemann Solver</a><span class="id">[2510.18251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper proposes a novel numerical method based on Godunov Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for special relativistic fluid dynamics.

The study is restricted to two-dimensional horizontal perturbations. It is therefore independent of the vertical (traditional) Coriolis parameter. However, the flow has three velocity components due to the horizontal (non-traditional) Coriolis parameter. Three different scenarios of non-linear evolution of the shear instability are identified, depending on the non-dimensional Brunt-Väisälä frequency $N$ and the non-dimensional non-traditional Coriolis parameter $\tilde{f}$ (non-dimensionalized by the maximum shear), in the range $\tilde{f}&lt;N$ for fixed Reynolds and Schmidt numbers $Re=2000$, $Sc=1$. When the stratification is strong $N\gg 1$, the shear instability generates stable Kelvin-Helmholtz billows like in the traditional limit $\tilde{f}=0$. Furthermore, when $N\gg1$, the governing equations for any $\tilde{f}$ can be transformed into those for $\tilde{f}=0$. This enables us to directly predict the characteristics of the flow depending on $\tilde{f}$ and $N$. When $N$ is around unity and $\tilde{f}$ is above a threshold, the primary Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex is destabilised by secondary instabilities but it remains coherent. For weaker stratification, $N\leqslant0.5$ and $\tilde{f}$ large enough, secondary instabilities develop vigorously and destroy the primary vortex into small-scales turbulence. Concomitantly, the enstrophy rises to high values by stretching/tilting as in fully three-dimensional flows. A local analysis of the flow prior to the onset of secondary instabilities reveals that the Fjortoft necessary condition for instability is satisfied, suggesting that they correspond to shear instabilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18419" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Causality as a guiding principle for physics beyond General Relativity</a><span class="id">[2510.18419]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This thesis is situated within the context of quantum gravity, broadly understood as any effort to explore the interplay between gravitation and the quantum realm, without necessarily requiring the quantization of the gravitational field itself.

Our attention is directed toward emergent approaches inspired by condensed matter physics. Rather than developing a full-fledged emergent theory and analyzing its detailed consequences, this work offers a concise roadmap of analyses and reflections relevant to emergent frameworks, without committing to any specific model. The thesis is divided into two parts, reflecting the distinct tools and analyses employed in each. The first addresses fundamental and conceptual aspects of emergent theories, focusing on the role of background structures, both regarding their implications for the theory and their constructive relevance.

The optimization problem is posed in the likeness of a multiple-shooting approach, aiming for segment-to-segment continuity while tracking proximity to the original CR3BP structures. The analysis of various formulations leads to the selection of an unconstrained least-squares problem for further investigation. The nonlinear optimization problem is convexified and the use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, as an alternative to the minimum-norm update equation found in most literature, is investigated for its control over the update step and inherent robustness. Additional techniques such as adaptive weighting are employed to further consolidate the behavior of the proposed algorithm in challenging scenarios. Numerical trials evaluate the adequacy of the methodology presented and compare it to the minimum-norm baseline over various application cases, including the generation of quasi-periodic trajectories and orbital transfers between them. The proposed approach is found to outperform the baseline in applications where the initial guess is poor and the ease of including proximity constraints provides benefits in control over the shape of the converged solution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">63.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter:connecting precision muon physics, cosmology, and colliders</a><span class="id">[2510.18564]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive study of the Muonic Portal to Vector Dark Matter (MPVDM), a minimal yet phenomenologically rich extension of the Standard Model featuring a new SU(2)_D gauge symmetry and vector-like muons. In this framework the dark sector interacts with the Standard Model only through these heavy leptons, linking dark matter and the muon sector. The MPVDM can simultaneously explain the observed relic abundance and the muon anomalous magnetic moment a_mu under both the &quot;tension&quot; and &quot;compatibility&quot; scenarios motivated by recent (g-2)_mu results. A key finding is a generic off-resonance velocity suppression mechanism that allows light (&lt;1 GeV) vector dark matter to evade CMB limits near 2*m_DM   m_H_D. Unlike scenarios based on ultra narrow Breit-Wigner resonances and early kinetic decoupling, the suppression follows from the temperature evolution of the annihilation cross section in a moderately detuned near resonant regime, where being 10-20 percent below resonance gives the required CMB era suppression without fine tuning. A five dimensional parameter scan shows that the tension scenario requires sub GeV dark matter with g_D   1e-3 and TeV scale vector like muons, while the compatibility scenario admits a broad mass range up to multi TeV. Recasting ATLAS and CMS searches for mu+ mu- + E_T^miss sets a lower bound of about 850 GeV on vector like muons. The MPVDM thus offers a unified, predictive, and experimentally accessible framework linking dark matter and muon physics across cosmological and collider frontiers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18656" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on Attractor Models of Inflation and Reheating from Planck, BICEP/Keck, ACT DR6, and SPT-3G Data</a><span class="id">[2510.18656]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyze the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ from Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope Data Release 6 (ACT DR6), and the South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) data, focusing on their implications for attractor models of inflation. We compare systematically observational bounds with theoretical predictions for both E-model ($\alpha$-Starobinsky) and T-model potentials. The observational constraints accommodate E-models with $\alpha \lesssim 25$, with the canonical Starobinsky model ($\alpha = 1$) predicting $n_s = 0.958-0.963$ for reheating temperatures between $100 - 10^{10}$ GeV, in good agreement with Planck 2018 data and within the 95% CL region determined by the Planck-ACT-SPT combination, but below the 95% confidence region of the Planck-ACT-DESI combination. Higher reheating temperatures from near-instantaneous reheating improve the compatibility. T-models predict slightly lower $n_s$ values (0.956-0.961), in some tension with Planck 2018 data, and we find an upper limit of $\alpha \lesssim 11$ in these models. We extend our analysis to generalized $\alpha$-attractors with monomial potentials $V(\varphi) \propto \varphi^k$ near the minimum, demonstrating that models with $k \geq 6$ naturally predict $n_s \simeq 0.965 - 0.968$ for typical number of $e$-folds, in better agreement with the ACT DR6 data.

In this paper, we comprehensively study dissipative effects in gravitational waves induced by curvature perturbations, known as induced gravitational waves (IGWs). We find dissipative effects become especially significant at wavenumber $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$, where $k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ corresponds to the horizon scale at the decoupling of weakly-interacting particles. They can leave characteristic features on the IGW spectrum, including a notable suppression with a “double-valley” structure at $k \sim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$ and a modified infrared behavior without logarithmic running at $k \lesssim k_{\mathcal{H},\mathrm{dec}}$. Within the Standard Model of particle physics, dissipative effects caused by neutrinos at the nanohertz frequencies can be important in the analysis of pulsar timing array data. Furthermore, dissipation-induced features associated with possible new weakly-interacting particles can be detectable by a wide range of gravitational-wave experiments, serving as a promising probe of new physics at extremely high energy scales. As an extension, we also discuss dissipative effects in the presence of primordial non-Gaussianity and their impacts on the anisotropies of IGWs and the poltergeist mechanism. These dissipative effects not only provide a more realistic description of IGWs but also exhibit rich phenomenology and profound physical implications, opening a new window into understanding the early Universe and fundamental physics.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18733" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ultraviolet Completion of the Big Bang in Quadratic Gravity</a><span class="id">[2510.18733]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a quantum quadratic gravity inflationary scenario that can accommodate the new cosmological constraints, which have disfavored Starobinsky inflation.

When a large number of matter fields contribute to the beta functions, the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be phenomenologically viable. We find that as inflation ends, the theory approaches its strong coupling regime and general relativity must emerge, as an effective field theory, as the universe must reheat and enter its standard radiation era. In order to avoid strong coupling, a minimum tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.01 is predicted for this theory.

The combination of these two heating sources can, for a narrow range of planetary properties and orbital parameters, continuously maintain surface temperatures amenable for habitability for planets around white dwarfs over time scales up to 10 Gyr.

More recently, extended stellar halos have been uncovered around several of these dwarfs through deeper imaging and spectroscopy. Such core-halo structures are not a feature of conventional cold dark matter (CDM). In contrast, smooth and prominent dark matter cores are predicted for wave/fuzzy dark matter ($\psi$DM). The question arises as to what extent the visible stellar profiles should reflect this dark matter core structure. Here we compare cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of CDM, “WDM” (model used as a proxy for $\psi$DM) &amp; $\psi$DM, aiming to predict the stellar profiles for these three DM scenarios. We show that cores surrounded by extended halos are distinguishable for $\psi$DM, where the stellar density is enhanced in the core due to the presence of the relatively dense soliton. Our analysis demonstrates that, in our simulations, a distinctive core-halo structure does not appear in the case of CDM in the DM, gas, or stars. Whereas we do find a core-halo transition for DM, gas, and stars for $\psi$DM, and the scale of this transition is in line with the predicted core radius set by the soliton scale anticipated for the adopted boson mass of 2.5$\times10^{-22}$eV. The presence of a core-halo structure in the stellar profile for Galaxy 1 for $\psi$DM is visible for the most massive and the first galaxy to form in the simulation. Clearly, further simulations are needed to establish how strict this possible relationship is between the DM and stellar core-halo profile as a potential observational discriminator. Furthermore, we observe the anticipated asymmetry for $\psi$DM due to the soliton's motion (jumping and random walk), a distinctive characteristic not found in the symmetric distributions of stars in the warm and CDM models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12056" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fate of Oceans on First-Generation Planets Orbiting White Dwarfs</a><span class="id">[2412.12056]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Several groups have recently suggested that small planets orbiting very closely around white dwarf stars could be promising locations for life to arise, even after stellar death. There are still many uncertainties, however, regarding the existence and habitability of these worlds. Here, we consider the retention of water during post-main-sequence evolution of a Sun-like star, and during the subsequent migration of planets to the white dwarf's habitable zone. This inward migration is driven by dynamical mechanisms such as planet-planet interactions in packed systems, which can excite planets to high eccentricities, setting the initial conditions for tidal migration into short-period orbits. In order for water to persist on the surfaces of planets orbiting white dwarfs, the water must first survive the AGB phase of stellar evolution, then avoid being lost due to photoevaporation due to X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) radiation from the newly-formed white dwarf, and then finally survive the tidal migration of the planet inwards to the habitable zone. We find that while this journey will likely desiccate large swaths of post-main-sequence planetary systems, planets with substantial reservoirs of water may retain some surface water, especially if their migration occurs at later white dwarf cooling ages. Therefore, although stellar evolution may pose a challenge for the retention of water on exoplanet surfaces, it is possible for planets to retain surface oceans even as their host stars die and their orbits evolve.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</a><span class="id">[2502.15881]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437–4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17676" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The DECADE cosmic shear project III: validation of analysis pipeline using spatially inhomogeneous data</a><span class="id">[2502.17676]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the pipeline for the cosmic shear analysis of the Dark Energy Camera All Data Everywhere (DECADE) weak lensing dataset: a catalog consisting of 107 million galaxies observed by the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) in the northern Galactic cap.

Improvements in our redshift distribution estimation methodology, combined with our enhanced calibration data and multi-band image simulations, allow us to extend our lensed sample out to a photometric redshift of $z_{\rm B}\leq2.0$. Compared to previous KiDS analyses, the increased survey area and redshift depth results in a $\sim32\%$ improvement in constraining power in terms of $\Sigma_8\equiv\sigma_8\left(\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3\right)^\alpha = 0.821^{+0.014}_{-0.016}$, where $\alpha = 0.58$ has been optimised to match the revised degeneracy direction of $\sigma_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$.

We find agreement with a cosmological constant except for the 1-2$\sigma$ deviation at 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.9, where DESI DR2 BAO measurements deviate from a cosmological constant at similar statistical significance. Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06930" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New constraints on cosmological gravitational waves from CMB and BAO in light of dynamical dark energy</a><span class="id">[2507.06930]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we derive upper limits on the physical energy-density fraction today of cosmological gravitational waves, denoted by $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}$, via analyzing \emph{Planck} &amp; ACT &amp; SPT CMB and DESI BAO data combination. In the standard cosmological model, we establish 95\% CL upper limits of $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ for adiabatic initial conditions and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.7 \times 10^{-7}$ for homogeneous initial conditions, assuming a uniform prior for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$. In light of dynamical dark energy, we get $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 7.2 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2} &lt; 2.4 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous). In contrast, if a log-uniform prior was assumed for $\Omega_{\rm gw}h^{2}$, these constraints can become tighter by a factor of $\sim4$, suggesting the results to be prior-sensitive. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity achievable with LiteBIRD &amp; CMB Stage-IV measurements of CMB and CSST observations of BAO, forecasting 68\% CL uncertainties of $\sigma = 2.5 \times 10^{-7}$ (adiabatic) and $\sigma = 1.0 \times 10^{-7}$ (homogeneous) for ${\Omega_{\rm{gw}}h^{2}}$. The constraints we obtained in this work provide critical benchmarks for exploring the cosmological origins of gravitational waves within the frequency band $f \gtrsim 10^{-15}$ Hz and potentially enable joint analysis with direct gravitational-wave detection sensitive to this regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09482" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining intrinsic S-type AGB masses and third dredge-up using pulsation</a><span class="id">[2508.09482]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The lowest mass at which the third dredge-up (TDU) occurs for thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars remains a key uncertainty in detailed stellar models. S-type AGB stars are an important constraint on this uncertainty as they have C/O ratios between 0.5 and 1, meaning they have only experienced up to a few episodes of TDU. AGB stars are also long-period variable stars, pulsating in low order radial pulsation modes. In this paper we estimate the initial masses of a large literature sample of intrinsic S-type AGB stars, by analysing their visual light curves, estimating their luminosities with Gaia DR3 parallax distances and finally comparing to a grid of detailed stellar models combined with linear pulsation models. We find that the initial mass distribution of intrinsic S-type stars peaks at 1.3 to 1.4 \Msun, depending on model assumptions. There also appear to be stars with initial masses down to 1 solar mass, which is in conflict with current detailed stellar models. Additionally, we find that though the mass estimates for semiregular variable stars pulsating in higher order radial modes are precise, the Mira variables pulsating in the fundamental mode present challenges observationally from uncertain parallax distances, and theoretically from the onset of increased mass-loss and the necessity of non-linear pulsation models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22805" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steady state of fast-oscillating neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium</a><span class="id">[2509.22805]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The streaming of neutrinos in an inhomogeneous medium is known to affect the physics of flavor conversion. We employ an ensemble of single-crossed angular distributions and explore the physics of flavor conversion, while neutrinos propagate across a one-dimensional inhomogeneous medium. The advective term in the neutrino equations of motion is responsible for the cascade of flavor waves towards ever smaller spatial and angular scales. However, as the system evolves, perturbations with large wavenumbers are damped, with a resulting smearing of the flavor configuration. We provide a simple recipe that allows to forecast the steady-state flavor configuration achieved by neutrinos without solving their kinetic equations. In particular, we find that flavor equipartition on one side of the angular spectrum and the cancellation of the spectral crossing in the lepton number distributions, proposed in the literature as generic flavor outcome, is a special solution depending on the degree of neutrino-antineutrino asymmetry. This work constitutes a step forward towards the development of semi-analytic schemes to account for flavor conversion physics in hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae and neutron-star merger remnants.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">81.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05229" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbital decay candidates reconsidered: WASP-4 b is not decaying and Kepler-1658 b is not a planet</a><span class="id">[2510.05229]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fate of hot Jupiters is thought to be engulfment by their host stars, the outcome of tidal orbital decay. Transit timing has revealed a few systems with apparently shrinking orbital periods, but such signals can be mimicked by light travel-time effects (LTTE) of a distant companion. Combining transit timings with precise radial-velocity data, including new data, we reassessed three reported cases of orbital decay: WASP-4, WASP-12, and Kepler-1658. For WASP-4, the period change is best explained by LTTE due to an  8-Jupiter-mass companion at  8 AU, with no need to invoke orbital decay. For WASP-12, in contrast, the data firmly exclude LTTE and confirm genuine orbital decay. For Kepler-1658, spectroscopic and photometric anomalies reveal the &quot;planet&quot; to be an eclipsing K/M binary bound to the F-type primary, with LTTE explaining the observed period change. Thus, among the known hot Jupiters, only WASP-12 b currently shows compelling evidence for orbital decay.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">82.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi II: NIRSpec Spectroscopy and CO Modeling at 285 and 385 Days Past the Explosion</a><span class="id">[2510.09600]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of SN 2024ggi, spanning wavelengths of 1.7–5.5 micron at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. These nebular spectra are dominated by asymmetric emission lines from atomic species including H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe, indicative of an aspherical explosion. The other strong features are molecular CO vibrational bands from the fundamental and first overtone. We introduce a novel, data-driven approach using non-LTE 3D radiative transfer simulations to model the CO emission with high fidelity. This method enables us to constrain the three-dimensional CO distribution and its radial temperature structure. CO formation is found to occur prior to day +285, with subsequent evolution characterized by progressive evaporation. The CO mass decreases from approximately 8.7 to 1.3*E-3 Mo, while the average temperature drops from about 2900 K to 2500 K. Concurrently, the CO distribution transitions from nearly homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast increasing from fc=1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of the CO-emitting region remains nearly constant (v1 = 1200 to 1100 km/s), significantly above the receding photosphere velocity (v(ph) = 500 km/s), suggesting the photosphere resides within Si-rich layers. However, the temperature profile indicates that only a narrow zone reaches the conditions necessary for SiO formation. Due to a lack of observational constraints, SiO clumping is not modeled, and thus, synthetic SiO profiles for mass estimates are not highlighted. We discuss the implications of these findings for dust formation processes in SN 2024ggi.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">83.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CHIME-o-Grav: Wideband Timing of Four Millisecond Pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset</a><span class="id">[2510.16668]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Wideband timing of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) datasets, where a single time-of-arrival (TOA) and a single dispersion measure (DM) are measured using the entire bandwidth of each observation, was first done for the 12.5-year dataset, and proved to be invaluable for characterizing the time-varying dispersion measure, reducing the data volume, and for improving the overall timing precision. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Telescope has been observing most NANOGrav millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at nearly daily cadence (compared to roughly monthly cadence for other NANOGrav observations) since 2019 with the objective of integration into future pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets. In this paper, we show the results of integration of high-cadence, low-observing-frequency CHIME data with data from the NANOGrav experiment for an isolated MSP PSR J0645$+$5158 and three binary MSPs PSR J1012$+$5307, PSR J2145$-$0750, and PSR J2302$+$4442. Using a wideband timing pipeline which we also describe, we present updated timing results for all four sources, including improvements in measurements of relativistic post-Keplerian parameters for the three binary pulsars in this analysis. For PSR J2302$+$4442, we report an updated strong detection of Shapiro delay from which we measured a companion mass of $0.35^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\ M_{\odot}$, a pulsar mass of $1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\ M_{\odot}$, and an orbital inclination of ${80^{\circ}}^{+1}_{-2}$. We also report updated constraints on the reflex motion for PSR J2145$-$0750 using a combination of Very Long Baseline Array astrometry and our updated measurement of the time derivative of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit as a prior.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">84.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational Production of Spin-3/2 Particles During Reheating</a><span class="id">[2309.15146]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compute the density of a spin-$\frac32$ particle, the raritron, produced at the end of inflation due to gravitational interactions.

They can be computed in asymptotically flat spacetimes using the conservation and evolution equations in the Bondi-Sachs framework. Modified theories of gravity have additional degrees of freedom with their own asymptotic evolution equations; these additional fields can produce differences in the memory effects in these theories from those in general relativity. In this work, we study a scalar-tensor theory of gravity known as the Damour-Esposito-Farèse extension of Brans-Dicke theory. We use the Bondi-Sachs framework to compute the field equations in Bondi-Sachs form, the asymptotically flat solutions, and the leading gravitational-wave memory effects. Although Damour-Esposito-Farèse theory has additional nonlinearities not present in Brans-Dicke theory, these nonlinearities are subleading effects; thus, the two theories share many similarities in the leading (and some subleading) solutions to hypersurface equations, asymptotic symmetries, and types of memory effects. The conservation equations for the mass and angular momentum aspects differ between the two theories, primarily because of the differences in the evolution equation for the scalar field. This leads to differences in the time dependence of the gravitational-wave memory signals that are produced during the quasicircular inspiral of compact binaries. These differences, however, are of second-order in a small coupling parameter of these theories, which suggests that it would be challenging to use memory effects to distinguish between these two theories. Nevertheless, our results can be used to analyze and interpret memory effects from numerical-relativity simulations of binaries in this theory.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">86.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02433" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals in relativistic accretion discs</a><span class="id">[2510.02433]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We compute relativistic Lindblad torques for circular, equatorial extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) embedded in relativistic thin accretion discs, including spinning black hole configurations. We find that relativistic effects can amplify the magnitude of these torques by orders of magnitude in the strong-field regime, and that the torque can even reverse direction as the EMRI approaches the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). However, we show that the location of this reversal is highly spin-dependent, shifting progressively closer to the ISCO, where gravitational-wave emission completely dominates the inspiral, as the spin of the central black hole increases. Spin also modifies the radial dependence of the Lindblad torques. We investigate whether Lindblad torques can be approximated by parametrised power laws of the form T_LR = A(r_s / 10M)^n_r (or combinations thereof), and find significant spin- and disc-dependent variations in the slope parameter n_r. For instance, for spin a/M = 0.9, we find n_r = 3.6 in the strong-field regime, compared to the Newtonian value of n_r = 4.5. Given current forecasts of parameter recovery for “golden”, loud EMRIs in accretion discs (\Delta n_r   0.5), we predict LISA could distinguish between different disc configurations through their relativistic Lindblad torque signatures, providing the first direct probe of the midplane structure of the inner region of accretion discs, which is inaccessible to electromagnetic observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17449" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers</a><span class="id">[2510.17449]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.</p></div></details></article></body>
