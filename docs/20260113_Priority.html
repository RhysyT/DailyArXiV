This poses a serious problem in the interpretation of both observations and numerical simulations. In this paper, we use filtering operators in real space to separate bulk motion from turbulence at different scales. We show how filters can be used to define consistent kinetic and magnetic energies for the bulk and turbulent component. We apply our GPU-accelerated filtering pipeline to a simulation of a major galaxy cluster merger, which is part of the PICO-Clusters suite of zoom-in cosmological simulations of massive clusters using the moving mesh code Arepo and the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model. We find that during the merger the turbulent pressure fraction on physical scales $\lesssim$160 kpc reaches a maximum of 5%, before decreasing to 2% after $\sim$1.3 Gyr from the core passage. These low values are consistent with recent observations of clusters with XRISM, and suggest that unless a cluster was recently perturbed by a major merger, turbulence levels are low. We then re-examine the popular multiscale iterative filter method. In our tests, we find that its use can introduce artifacts, and that it does not reliably disentangle fluctuations living on widely separated length scales. Rather, we believe it is more fruitful to use fixed-scale filters and turbulent energies to compare between simulations and observations. This work significantly improves our understanding of turbulence generation by major mergers in galaxy clusters, which can be probed by XRISM and next-generation X-ray telescopes, allowing us to connect high-resolution cosmological simulations to observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of massive multiple-star systems: early migration and mergers</a><span class="id">[2601.06251]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Massive stars are often found in multiple systems, yet how binary-star systems with very close separations ($\lesssim$ au) assemble remains unresolved. We investigate the formation and inward migration of massive-star binaries in Solar-metallicity environments using the star-cluster formation simulation of Chon et al. (2024), which forms a $1200\,M_\odot$ stellar cluster and resolves binaries down to 1 au separation. Our results indicate that stars more massive than $2\,M_{\odot}$ predominantly assemble in binary or triple configurations, in agreement with observations, with member stars forming nearly coevally. In most of these systems, the inner binary hardens by one to three orders of magnitude and reaches a steady-state within the first $0.1\,$Myr. Notably, all binaries whose final separations are below 10 au are hardened with the aid of circumbinary discs, highlighting disc-driven migration as a key to produce tight massive binaries. We further find that binaries form with random inclinations relative to the initial rotation axis of the cloud, and that mutual inclinations in triple systems follow an isotropic distribution, implying that stochastic interactions driven by turbulence and few-body dynamics are crucial during assembly and migration. Finally, stars with $M&gt;2\,M_{\odot}$ often undergo repeated merger events during cluster evolution, yielding extreme mass ratios ($q&lt;0.1$). Some of these products may evolve into compact-object binaries containing a black hole or neutron star, including X-ray binaries and systems detectable by Gaia.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Masers and Broad-Line Mapping Favor Magnetically-Dominated AGN Accretion Disks</a><span class="id">[2601.06253]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a novel and powerful constraint on the physics of supermassive black hole (BH) accretion disks. We show that in the outer disk (radii $R \gtrsim 0.01\,$pc or $\gtrsim 1000\,R_{G}$), models supported by thermal or radiation pressure predict disk masses which are much larger than the BH mass and increase with radius - i.e. rapidly-rising, extremely non-Keplerian rotation curves. More generally, we show that any observational upper limit to the deviation from Keplerian potentials at these radii directly constrains the physical form of the pressure in disks. We then show that existing maser and broad line region (BLR) kinematic observations immediately rule out the classic thermal-pressure-dominated Shakura Sunyaev-like $\alpha$-disk model, and indeed rule out any thermal or radiation (or cosmic-ray) pressure-dominated disk, as the required temperatures and luminosities of the gas at large radii would exceed those observed by orders of magnitude. We show that models where the pressure comes entirely from turbulence (without thermal, radiation, or magnetic sources) could in principle be viable but would require turbulent Toomre $Q \gtrsim 100$, far larger than predicted by self gravitating/gravito-turbulent models. However, recently proposed models of magnetic pressure-dominated disks agree with all of the observational constraints. These magnetically-dominated models also appear to agree better with constraints on maser magnetic fields, compared to the other possibilities. Observations appear to strongly favor the hypothesis that the outer regions of BH accretion disks are in the 'hyper-magnetized' state.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06255" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GA-NIFS: high prevalence of dusty and metal-enriched outflows in massive and luminous star-forming galaxies at $z\sim3-9$</a><span class="id">[2601.06255]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a search for and characterization of ionized outflows in 15 star-forming systems at $z\sim3-9$ with no evidence of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU as part of the GA-NIFS program. The targets often show satellites and complex substructure, from which we isolate 40 galaxies/regions. The sample probes the high-mass end of the galaxy population, with most sources having log$_{10}$ (M$_\star$/M$_\odot$)=$9.5-11$, extending previous studies on high-z star formation driven outflows that mainly focused on lower-mass galaxies. Using the [OIII]5007 and H$\alpha$ emission lines, we identify broad kinematic components consistent with galactic outflows in 14 galaxies/regions. We find that the outflowing gas is more dust attenuated (by $A_{\rm V}$$\sim0.59$ mag on average) and metal-enriched (0.13 dex) than the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxies, but its velocities are insufficient to escape the galaxies and reach the circumgalactic medium, suggesting that outflows mainly redistribute dust and metals around their hosts. The outflows identified in this study display velocity dispersions within $\sigma_{\rm out}=130-340$ km s$^{-1}$ and outflow velocities $v_{\rm out}=170-600$ km s$^{-1}$, and, when combined with less luminous and less massive star-forming galaxies from previous works, reveal a statistically significant correlation between $v_{\rm out}$ and star formation rate (SFR). The typically low mass-loading factors ($\eta=\dot{M}_{\rm out}/SFR$$\leq1$, in 9 out of 14 the outflows) indicate that these outflows do not strongly suppress star formation. Overall, our results suggest that ejective feedback via ionized outflows is inefficient in massive, luminous star-forming galaxies within the first 2 Gyr of the Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06258" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmological back-reaction of baryons on dark matter in the CAMELS simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.06258]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Baryonic processes such as radiative cooling and feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) directly redistribute baryons in the Universe but also indirectly redistribute dark matter due to changes in the gravitational potential. In this work, we investigate this &quot;back-reaction&quot; of baryons on dark matter using thousands of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations from the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) project, including parameter variations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. Matching haloes to corresponding N-body (dark matter-only) simulations, we find that virial masses decrease owing to the ejection of baryons by feedback. Relative to N-body simulations, halo profiles show an increased dark matter density in the center (due to radiative cooling) and a decrease in density farther out (due to feedback), with both effects being strongest in SIMBA (&gt; 450% increase at r &lt; 0.01 Rvir). The clustering of dark matter strongly responds to changes in baryonic physics, with dark matter power spectra in some simulations from each model showing as much as 20% suppression or increase in power at k   10 h/Mpc relative to N-body simulations. We find that the dark matter back-reaction depends intrinsically on cosmology (Omega_m and sigma_8) at fixed baryonic physics, and varies strongly with the details of the feedback implementation. These results emphasize the need for marginalizing over uncertainties in baryonic physics to extract cosmological information from weak lensing surveys as well as their potential to constrain feedback models in galaxy evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06270" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spectral Signatures of Spinning Dust from Grain Ensembles in Diverse Environments: A Combined Theoretical and Observational Study</a><span class="id">[2601.06270]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations of anomalous microwave emission (AME) reveal spectral features that are not readily reproduced by spinning dust models, motivating further investigation. We examine how dust grain distributions and environmental parameters determine the peak frequency and spectral width of AME spectral energy distribution (SED). Using Monte Carlo sampling and global sensitivity analysis, we find that AME features are dominantly controlled by three parameters: grain size, shape, and a phase-dependent environmental parameter. We also quantify the effects of SED broadening from ensembles of these dominant parameters, finding that the level of tension with observations is strongly phase dependent: Molecular Cloud (MC) is fully consistent, Dark Cloud (DC) shows minor deviations, and HII regions exhibit significant offsets in peak frequency. This points to possible issues in phase-dependent AME extraction, interstellar medium (ISM) environment identification, or underlying theoretical tension. Ensemble variations in both grain size and environmental parameters are required to reproduce the observed spread in peak frequency and spectral width. We further propose moment expansion and emulation-based inference methods for future AME spectral fit and feature analysis.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CAMELS Environments: The Impact of Local Neighbours on Galaxy Evolution across the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE Simulations</a><span class="id">[2601.06290]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Internal feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) play a key role in galaxy evolution, but external environmental effects can also strongly influence galaxies. We investigate the impact of environment on galaxy evolution, and its dependence on baryonic physics implementation, using Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations (CAMELS) spanning a wide range of stellar and AGN feedback implementations in the SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, ASTRID, and Swift-EAGLE galaxy formation models. We show that satellite galaxies are significantly affected by the environment in all simulation models, with their gas fraction and star formation rate (SFR) suppressed in overdense regions compared to similar mass satellites in underdense environments at $z=0$. Central galaxies are less sensitive to environment but tend to show lower gas fraction and SFR in overdense regions at low stellar mass, transitioning to higher gas fraction and SFR for massive galaxies in higher-density environments. Halo baryon fraction ($f_{\rm B}$) and circumgalactic medium mass fraction ($f_{\rm CGM}$) at $z=0$ show clear environmental effects. In SIMBA, low-mass haloes in overdense regions have systematically lower $f_{\rm B}$ and $f_{\rm CGM}$ at fixed halo mass, while Swift-EAGLE haloes in overdense regions have systematically higher $f_{\rm B}$ and $f_{\rm CGM}$ across the full halo mass range, and IllustrisTNG and ASTRID show opposite trends at the low and high mass ends. Environmental effects can flip at higher redshift, with SFR and $f_{\rm B}$ increasing with local density in low-mass haloes before quenching at an increasing overdensity threshold. Our results demonstrate that the impact of environment on galaxy evolution depends significantly on galaxy formation model, and higher-density environments can either suppress or enhance star formation depending on galaxy mass and cosmic epoch.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Star formation quenching precedes morphological transformation in COSMOS-WEB's richest galaxy groups</a><span class="id">[2601.06297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyzed the 25 richest galaxy groups in COSMOS-Web at z = 0.18-3.65, identified via the AMICO algorithm. These groups contain 20-30 galaxies with high (&gt;75%) membership probability. Our study reveals both passive-density and active-density relations: late-type galaxies (LTGs) prefer higher central overdensities than early-type galaxies (ETGs) across all groups, and many massive LTGs exhibit colors typical of quiescent galaxies. We identify red sequences (RS) in 5 groups, prominently established at z &lt; 1, with early emergence in the RS locus up to z   2.2. This suggests group environments represent a transitional phase where star formation quenching precedes morphological transformation, contrasting with the classical morphology-density relation in rich clusters. In the central regions ( 33 arcsec / 100 kpc from centers), we identified 86 galaxies: 23 ( 27%) ETGs and 63 ( 73%) LTGs. High-mass galaxies (M_star &gt; 10^10.5 M_sun) undergo rapid quenching over  1 Gyr, becoming predominantly spheroidal ETGs. This indicates morphological transformation accelerates in massive systems during peak cosmic star formation. Intermediate-mass galaxies (10^9 &lt; M_star/M_sun &lt; 10^10.5) show mild quenching, while low-mass galaxies (M_star &lt; 10^9 M_sun) remain largely star-forming; here, environmental processes suppress star formation without destroying disks, suggesting group quenching operates on longer timescales than mass quenching. Overall, mass-dependent quenching dominates the high-mass end, while environment shapes lower-mass systems. The HLAGN fraction for both groups and field increases with redshift, peaking at z   2, with groups consistently showing higher fractions. We suggest AGN feedback partially drives rapid quenching in high-mass galaxies, while mergers may trigger AGN activity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06355" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collision between molecular clouds IV: The role of feedback and magnetic field in head on collisions</a><span class="id">[2601.06355]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We systematically investigate how cloud-cloud collisions influence star formation, emphasizing the roles of collision velocity, magnetic field orientation, and radiative feedback. Using the first cloud-cloud collision simulations that model individual star formation and accretion with all stellar feedback mechanisms, we explore the morphological evolution, star formation efficiency (SFE), fragmentation, stellar mass distribution, and feedback-driven gas dispersal. Our results show that cloud collisions substantially enhance the rate and timing of star formation compared to isolated scenarios, though the final SFE remains broadly similar across all setups. Lower collision velocities facilitate prolonged gravitational interaction and accumulation of gas, promoting sustained star formation characterized by elongated filamentary structures. Conversely, high-velocity collisions induce rapid gas compression and turbulent motions, leading to intense but transient episodes of star formation, which are curtailed by feedback-driven dispersal. The orientation of the magnetic field markedly affects collision outcomes. Parallel fields allow gas to collapse efficiently along magnetic lines, forming fewer but more massive stars. In contrast, perpendicular fields generate significant magnetic pressure, which stabilizes the shock-compressed gas and delays gravitational collapse, resulting in more distributed and less massive stellar fragments. Radiative feedback from massive stars consistently regulates star formation, halting further gas accretion at moderate efficiencies (10-15%) and initiating feedback-driven dispersal. Although the cloud dynamics vary significantly, the stellar mass function remains robust across scenarios-shaped modestly by magnetic orientation but only weakly influenced by collision velocity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Generalized Bondi Accretion Flow with and without Outflow</a><span class="id">[2601.06397]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The properties of accretion flows are affected by the angular momentum of the accreting gas. M.-G. Park found that the mass accretion rate, specifically, decreases significantly as the gas angular momentum increases. However, R. Narayan &amp; A. C. Fabian found the decrease modest. We investigate global solutions for rotating polytropic flows in a much wider parameter space to understand their general properties within the slim disk approximation and a viscosity description suitable for both low- and high-angular-momentum flows. We find that the mass accretion rate for flows with a small Bondi radius decreases steeply as the gas angular momentum increases, while for those with a large Bondi radius, it decreases gradually. Therefore, the decrease of mass accretion rate due to gas rotation can be significant or mild depending on the Bondi radius. We further investigate global solutions of accretion with outflows using the ADIOS model of R. D. Blandford &amp; M. C. Begelman. Stronger outflows in general slightly increase the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary, but the actual mass accreted into the black hole decreases by orders of magnitude. Stronger outflows also weaken the dependence of the mass accretion rate on the gas angular momentum when the viscosity parameter {\alpha} is small. The intricate dependence of the mass inflow rate at the outer boundary and the mass accretion rate into the black hole on gas angular momentum will have interesting implications for the growth of black holes and their energy output.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06480" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ruling Out Compact Jets as the Dominant Source of Radio Emission in Radio-quiet, High Eddington-ratio Active Galactic Nuclei</a><span class="id">[2601.06480]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of core radio emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is still actively debated. General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations often predict the launching of moderately large-scale jets from super-Eddington accretion flows, but this prediction seems at odds with observations indicating most high/super-Eddington AGNs appear radio quiet. Here, we use the ratio of radio to X-ray luminosities as a multiwavelength diagnostic to probe the origin of radio emission in a sample of 69 radio-quiet, high/super-Eddington AGNs with black-hole masses $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}-10^{9}~M_\odot$. With this wide dynamic range in $M_{\rm BH}$, we adapt existing formalisms for how jetted radio emission and accretion-powered X-ray emission scale with black hole mass into the super-Eddington regime. We find that the radio/X-ray luminosity ratios observed across this $M_{\rm BH}$ range are inconsistent with a jet-dominated model for radio emission. We discuss how our results may instead be consistent with a corona-dominated radio emission origin with a contribution from outflows at higher accretion rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AstroSat UV Deep Field IV. An Extended UV disk around a massive spiral galaxy at z=0.67</a><span class="id">[2601.06581]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extended ultraviolet (XUV) emission in nearby disk galaxies supports the inside-out growth scenario through low-efficiency star formation in their outer regions. However, such detections have largely been limited to the local Universe (z   0) due to the need for deep, high-resolution UV imaging. We report the detection of a clumpy XUV disk in a massive, isolated spiral galaxy $(log(M_*/M_\odot) \approx 11.04)$ at z=0.67, observed with AstroSat/UVIT. The intrinsic rest frame FUV surface brightness profile, corrected for the instrument PSF, shows a more extended disk than its optical and IR counterparts. The XUV disk reaches nearly twice the optical radius and includes a large UV-bright low surface brightness (LSB) region $(S_{LSB}/S_{K80}\approx9.3, \mu_{FUV}-\mu_K\approx 1)$, consistent with the Type II XUV definition. Additionally, the detection of UV clumps without optical counterparts supports a Type I classification, suggesting gravitational instabilities and recent star formation. These features point to recent cold gas accretion onto the outer disk. From the asymmetric light profile, we estimate a gas accretion rate of $\sim 11 M_\odot$ $yr^{-1}$, providing evidence of active disk growth at intermediate redshift.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06589" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining Inflation Models with Spinning Voids</a><span class="id">[2601.06589]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a powerful new diagnostics by which the running of scalar spectral index of primordial density fluctuations can be tightly and independently constrained. This new diagnostics utilizes coherent rotation of void galaxies, which can be observed as redshift asymmetry in opposite sides dichotomized by the projected spin axes of hosting voids. Comparing the numerical results from the AbacusSummit of cosmological simulations, we derive a non-parametric model for the redshift asymmetry distribution of void galaxies, which turns out to be almost universally valid for a very broad range of cosmologies including dynamic dark energy models with time-dependent equation of states as well as the $\Lambda$CDM models with various initial conditions. We discover that the universality of this model breaks down only if the running of scalar spectral index deviates from zero, detecting a consistent trend that a more positive (negative) running yields a lower (higher) redshift asymmetry of voids than the model predictions. Given that non-standard inflations usually predict non-zero runnings of the spectral index and that the redshift asymmetry distribution of voids is a readily observable quantity, we conclude that this new diagnostics will pave another path toward understanding the true mechanism of inflation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06718" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evaluating the efficacy of a data cube treatment procedure for kinematic analyses: application to NGC 3115 and NGC 4699</a><span class="id">[2601.06718]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Data cubes have been increasingly used in astronomy. These data sets, however, are usually affected by instrumental effects and high-frequency noise. In this work, we evaluate the efficacy of a data cube treatment methodology, previously proposed by our research group, for analyses focused on the stellar and gas kinematics. To do that, we used data cubes of the central regions of the galaxies NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, obtained with the Integral Field Unit of the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph. For each galaxy, we analysed three data cubes: non-treated, filtered (with the Butterworth spatial filtering) and filtered and deconvolved (with the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution). For each data cube, we performed a dynamical modelling, using Jeans Anisotropic Models, to obtain, among other parameters, the masses of the central supermassive black holes. Both for NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, the values of the parameters provided by the dynamical modelling from the non-treated, filtered and filtered and deconvolved data cubes were compatible, at the 1-$\sigma$ level. However, the use of the Butterworth spatial filtering decreased the uncertainty of the parameters. The additional use of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution decreased even more the uncertainty of the parameters. The complete data treatment procedure resulted in decreases of 41% and 45% in the uncertainties of the supermassive black hole masses in NGC 3115 and NGC 4699, respectively. These results indicate that our treatment procedure not only does not compromise analyses of data cubes focused on the stellar or gas kinematics, but actually improves the quality of the results.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06759" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SPHEREx Re-Observation of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS in December 2025: Detection of Increased Post-Perihelion Activity, Refractory Coma Dust, and New Coma Gas Species</a><span class="id">[2601.06759]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In December-2025, the NASA SPHEREx spacecraft re-observed ISO 3I/ATLAS post-perihelion, finding a much more active object compared to August-2025 SPHEREx pre-perihelion observations, with marked evidence for development into an cometary body fully sublimating all its ices. The new imaging spectrophotometry is dominated by spatially resolved features due to dust scattered-light and thermal emission plus gas-emissions from CN (0.93 um), H2O (2.7 um), organic C-H (3.2 to 3.6 um), CO2 (4.25 to 4.27 um), and CO (4.6 to 4.8 um). The CO2 gas-coma continues to be extended out to a 3 arcmin radius. The continuum spectral signature of H2O-ice absorption has mostly disappeared, replaced by scattered-light plus thermal-emission from organo-silicaceous dust grains while the H2O gas-emission is 20 times brighter. All but the organics-gas comae are circularly symmetric, while a weak pear-shaped solar-pointing dust tail consistent with large dust grains is now present.

It represents a key phase of matter in the baryon cycle involving accretion, feedback, outflows, and gas recycling. Redshifted $21$ cm line emission originating from galaxies serves as a key tracer for investigating HI gas and its dynamics in the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM), and enables the study of galaxy evolution. Nonetheless, direct detections of HI are currently limited to $z \leq 0.4$ due to the inherently weak $21$ cm emission line. Ongoing and upcoming large radio surveys aim to detect $21$ cm emission from galaxies up to $z \gtrsim 1$ with unprecedented sensitivity. In current work, we present a novel approach for creating optical-HI joint mock catalogs for upcoming SKA precursor surveys: MIGHTEE-HI and LADUMA with MeerKAT and WALLABY with ASKAP. Incorporation of optical properties along with HI in our mock catalogs makes these a powerful tool for making predictions for upcoming surveys and provides a benchmark for exploring the HI science (e.g., conditional HIMF and optical-to-HI scaling relations) expected from these surveys. As a case study, we show the use of the joint catalogs for predicting the expected outcome of stacking detection for average HI mass in galaxies that are below the threshold for direct detection. We show that combining stacking observations with the number of direct detections puts a strong constraint on the HI mass function, especially in the regime where the number of direct detections is small, as often happens near the farther edge of HI surveys. This intermediate step may be used to set priors for the full determination of the HI mass function.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06924" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Isaac Newton Telescope Monitoring Survey of Local Group Dwarf Galaxies-VIII.

This study is accompanied by a public data release that includes two comprehensive catalogs, a catalog of the complete stellar populations for each galaxy and a separate catalog listing all identified LPV candidates. Both are available through CDS/VizieR and provide a valuable resource for investigating quenching timescales, stellar mass distributions, and the effects of mass-loss and dust production in dwarf galaxies. We derive updated structural parameters, including newly measured half-light radii, and determine distance moduli using the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) method with Sobel-filter edge detection, yielding values between $23.38\pm0.06$ and $25.35\pm0.06$ mag.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitrogen abundances in star-forming galaxies 2.2 Gyr after the Big Bang are not elevated</a><span class="id">[2601.06968]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using deep medium-resolution JWST rest-optical spectra of a sample of typical star-forming galaxies (Lyman break galaxies and Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters) from the LyC22 survey at $z \sim 3$, we determined the nebular abundances of N, O, and Ne relative to H for a subsample of 25 objects with the direct method, based on auroral [OIII]4363 line detections. Our measurements increases the number of accurate N/O determinations at $z \sim 2-4$ using a homogeneous approach. We found a mean value of $\log({\rm N/O})=-1.29^{+0.25}_{-0.21} $ over a metallicity range 12+log(O/H)=7.5 to 8.44. The observed N/O ratio and scatter are indistinguishable from that observed in low-z galaxies and HII regions over the same metallicity range, showing thus no redshift evolution of N/O for typical galaxies over a significant fraction of cosmic time. We also show that typical $z \sim 3$ galaxies show a similar offset in the BPT diagram as galaxies from the low-z Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), when compared to the average of SDSS galaxies, and show that this offset is not due to enhanced nitrogen abundances. Our results establish a basis for future studies of the evolution of N and O at higher redshifts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On the 3D time evolution of the dust size distribution in protostellar envelopes</a><span class="id">[2601.07088]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dust plays a fundamental role during protostellar collapse, disk and planet formation. Recent observations suggest that efficient dust growth may begin early, in the protostellar envelopes, potentially even before the formation of the disk. Three-dimensional models of protostellar evolution, addressing multi-size dust growth, gas and dust dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics, are required to characterize the dust evolution in the embedded stages of star formation. We aim to establish a new framework for dust evolution models, following in 3D the dust size distribution both in time and space, in MHD models describing the formation and evolution of star-disk systems, at low numerical cost. We present our work coupling the COALA dust evolution module into the code RAMSES, performing the first 3D MHD simulation of protostellar collapse including simultaneously polydisperse dust growth modeled by the Smoluchowski equation as well as dust dynamics in the terminal velocity approximation. Ice-coated micron-sized grains can rapidly grow in the envelope and survive by not entering the fragmentation regime. The evolution of the dust size distribution is highly anisotropic due to the turbulent nature of the collapse and the development of favorable locations such as outflow cavity walls, which enhance locally the dust-to-gas ratio. We analyzed the first 3D non-ideal MHD simulations that self-consistently account for the dust dynamics and growth during the protostellar stage. Very early in the lifetime of a young embedded protostar, micron-sized grains can grow, and locally the dust size distribution deviates significantly from the MRN initial shape. This new numerical method opens the perspective to treat simultaneously gas/dust dynamics and dust growth in 3D simulations at a low numerical cost for several astrophysical environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07127" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hierarchical Structure of the Open Cluster NGC 752</a><span class="id">[2601.07127]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The structure of open clusters provides key insights into their evolution and the dynamics of the Milky Way. Using Gaia DR3 data, we applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm to the open cluster NGC 752 based on the kinematical information and identified four substructures corresponding to different stages of disintegration. The cluster exhibits a pronounced signature of mass segregation. Its outer members show a clear expansion trend with a velocities of 0.25 $\rm{km~s^{-1}}$ in the plane of the sky. In addition, the system shows a projected rotational pattern with an angular velocity of approximately 0.03 $\rm{rad~Myr^{-1}}$. We also identified a correlation between the escape times of disturbed members and the epochs at which the cluster crossed the Galactic disk, highlighting the role of Galactic tidal forces in accelerating cluster dissolution. We conclude that hierarchical clustering based on projection bounding energy is effective for studying the internal structure of star clusters, but it has limitations when dealing with unconstrained structures such as tidal tails.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">First Submillimeter Lights from Dome A: Tracing the Carbon Cycle in the Feedback of Massive Stars</a><span class="id">[2601.07162]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cycling of carbon between its ionized, atomic, and molecular phases shapes the chemical compositions and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM).

Dome A, the most promising site for submillimeter astronomy, has long resisted successful submillimeter astronomical observations. Using the 60 cm Antarctic Terahertz Explorer, we present the first successful CO ($4-3$) and [CI] ($^3P_1 - ^3P_0$) mapping observations of two archetypal triggered massive star-formation regions at Dome A. These data, together with archival [CII], provide the first complete characterization of all three carbon phases in these environments. We find elevated C$^{0}$/CO abundance ratios in high-extinction regions, plausibly driven by deep penetration of intense radiation fields from massive stars into a clumpy ISM. These findings mark a major milestone for submillimeter astronomy at Dome A and offer valuable insights into the impact of massive star feedback on the surrounding ISM.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Study Revealing Physical Attributes of Supernova Remnant in G321.3-3.9</a><span class="id">[2601.07170]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a radio analysis of the recently identified supernova remnant G321.3-3.9 using archival multi-wavelength data spanning 88-2304 MHz.

To derive the initial mass function (IMF) of a large sample of NYMGs, we developed and applied an algorithm that uses photometry and astrometry from Gaia DR3 to detect NYMGs in a kinematic space. We inferred individual masses from the photometry of both the detected and the previously known candidates. We estimated the IMFs for 33 groups, 30 of them for the first time, in an average mass range $0.1&lt;m/M_\odot&lt;5$ with some groups going as low as $0.02~M_{\odot}$ and as high as $10~M_{\odot}$. We parameterized these IMFs using a log-normal for $m&lt;1~M_\odot$ and a power-law for $m&gt;1~M_\odot$. We detected 4166 source candidate members of 44 known groups, including 2545 new candidates. We recovered 44-54\% of the literature candidates and estimated a contamination rate from old field stars of 16-24\%. The candidates of the detected groups distribute along young isochrones, which suggests that they are potential members of NYMGs. Parameterizations of both the average of the 33 IMFs based on our detections ($m_c=0.25\pm0.17~M_{\odot}$, $\sigma_c=0.45\pm0.17$, and $\alpha=-2.26\pm0.09$) and the one based on the known candidates from the literature ($m_c=0.22\pm0.14~M_{\odot}$, $\sigma_c=0.45\pm0.17$, and $\alpha=-2.45\pm0.06$) are in agreement with the IMF parameterization of the solar neighbourhood and young stellar associations. Our parameterization of the average IMF together with the distribution of the detected group members along young isochrones provide strong evidence suggesting that the NYMGs are remnants of individual stellar associations and clusters and that there are no systematic biases in our detection and in the literature in the range $0.1&lt;m/M_{\odot}&lt;10$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07211" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Broad line regions behind haze: Intrinsic shape of Br$γ$ line and its origin in a type-1 Seyfert galaxy</a><span class="id">[2601.07211]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The broad-line region (BLR) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is an essential component, yet its small size keeps its origin, structure, and kinematics uncertain. Infrared interferometry with VLTI/GRAVITY is now resolving BLR-scale emission, with data for NGC 3783 consistent with a rotating, geometrically thick configuration. However, the processes shaping the spectra remain poorly constrained, and the cloud models are tuned phenomenologically rather than derived from first-principles predictions. We address this by coupling three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic (RHD) simulations of gas around a supermassive black hole with radiative-transfer calculations using Cloudy, comparing the results to the SINFONI Br$\gamma$ profile of NGC 3783. We find that Br$\gamma$ arises from ionized gas in the surface of the rotating thin disk, with electron temperatures of approximately $T_e \approx 10^4$ K and number densities of $n_e \approx 10^8-10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$. However, the intrinsic line profile produced by the RHD kinematics is narrower than observed and displays substructure. An approximate treatment of the electron scattering suggests that scattering in surrounding diffuse ionized gas significantly broadens and smooths the intrinsic Br$\gamma$ profile, making it consistent with the observed profile. This scattering medium has an electron temperature of $10^4 - 10^5$ K, and a number density of $n \lesssim 10^8$ cm$^{-3}$. Although a best-fit viewing angle of $\approx 15$ deg is suggested, the scattered line is notably less sensitive to inclination than the intrinsic line. The observed BLR profiles may be understood as the intrinsic emission viewed through an electron-scattering haze, such that some spectral detail is plausibly redistributed rather than seen directly.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07292" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photometric Redshift Estimation Using Scaled Ensemble Learning</a><span class="id">[2601.07292]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The development of the state-of-the-art telescopic systems capable of performing expansive sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Euclid, and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) has significantly advanced efforts to refine cosmological models. These advances offer deeper insight into persistent challenges in astrophysics and our understanding of the Universe's evolution. A critical component of this progress is the reliable estimation of photometric redshifts (Pz). To improve the precision and efficiency of such estimations, the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to large-scale astronomical datasets has become essential. This study presents a new ensemble-based ML framework aimed at predicting Pz for faint galaxies and higher redshift ranges, relying solely on optical (grizy) photometric data. The proposed architecture integrates several learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine, extreme gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, and artificial neural networks, within a scaled ensemble structure. By using bagged input data, the ensemble approach delivers improved predictive performance compared to stand-alone models. The framework demonstrates consistent accuracy in estimating redshifts, maintaining strong performance up to z   4. The model is validated using publicly available data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Survey Program by the Subaru Telescope. Our results show marked improvements in the precision and reliability of Pz estimation. Furthermore, this approach closely adheres to-and in certain instances exceeds-the benchmarks specified in the LSST Science Requirements Document. Evaluation metrics include catastrophic outlier, bias, and rms.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">26.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07297" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WISE/CatWISE Constraints on Dysonian Waste-Heat Technosignatures in Nearby Galaxies</a><span class="id">[2601.07297]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We search for galaxy-scale (Dysonian) waste heat in the mid-infrared using WISE.

This extension incorporates sub-resolution models for chemical enrichment, black hole and star formation, AGN kinetic and thermal feedback, supernova-driven feedback, galactic winds, and metal-line cooling. We present an inference framework based on high-fidelity emulators to aid in model calibration against observational targets, e.g., the galaxy stellar mass function, radial gas density profiles, and the cluster gas fraction.

This provides us with a unique opportunity to study the evolution of the inner accretion flow almost in real time. Here, we used over 1000 observations to study the broadband X-ray spectra of a sample of five CSAGNs, spanning three orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd}$), using phenomenological models to trace the evolution of key spectral components. We derive several fundamental parameters, such as the photon index, soft excess strength, reflection strength, and luminosities of the soft excess and primary continuum. We find that the soft excess and primary continuum emissions show a very strong positive correlation ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), suggesting a common physical origin. The soft excess strength does not show any dependency on the reflection parameter, suggesting that in these objects the soft excess is not dominated by a blurred ionized reflection process. On the other hand, the strength of the soft excess is found to be strongly positively correlated with the Eddington ratio ($p \ll 10^{-10}$), and we find that the soft excess vanishes below $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim -2.5$. Moreover, we find a clear `V'-shaped relation for $\Gamma-\lambda_{\rm Edd}$, with a break at $\log \lambda_{\rm Edd} = -2.47 \pm 0.09$. Our findings indicate a change in the geometry of the inner accretion flow at low Eddington ratios, and that the soft excess is primarily produced via warm Comptonization.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">29.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07345" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New $H(z)$ measurement at Redshift = 0.12 with DESI Data Release 1</a><span class="id">[2601.07345]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Hubble parameter ($H(z)$) is a function of the redshift and a reliable measurement is very important to understand the expansion history of the Universe.

We use an ultra-deep broadband spectral survey of G+0.693-0.027, carried out with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes, to conduct the astronomical search. We report the first interstellar detection of lactaldehyde (CH$_3$CH(OH)C(O)H) and methoxyacetaldehyde (CH$_3$OCH$_2$C(O)H), together with the second detections (i.e., confirmation) of methyl acetate (CH$_3$C(O)OCH$_3$) and hydroxyacetone (CH$_3$C(O)CH$_2$OH), and new detections in this source of both $anti$- and $gauche$- conformers of ethyl formate (CH$_3$CH$_2$OC(O)H), the latter tentatively. In contrast, neither propionic acid, CH$_3$CH$_2$C(O)OH, nor glycidol, c-CH$_2$OCHCH$_2$OH (i.e., the most and the least stable species within the C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ family, respectively) were detected, and we provide upper limits on their fractional abundances of $\leq$1.5 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$ and $\leq$3.7 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$. Interestingly, all C$_3$H$_6$O$_2$ isomers can be synthesized through radical-radical reactions on the surface of dust grains, ultimately tracing back to CO as the parent molecule. We suggest that formation of the detected isomers is mainly driven by successive hydrogenation of CO, producing CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CH$_2$OH as the primary parent species. Conversely, propionic acid is thought to originate from the oxygenation of CO via the HOCO intermediate, which help us rationalize its non-detection. Overall, our findings notably expand the known chemical inventory of the interstellar medium and provide direct observational evidence that increasingly complex chemistry involving O-bearing species occurs in space.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07374" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Possible evidence for a pair-instability supernova nature of ultra-early JWST sources</a><span class="id">[2601.07374]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent JWST observations have revealed a population of unexpectedly bright sources at ultra-high redshift ($z &gt; 15$), challenging current models of early galaxy formation.

Motivated by this variability, we explore the alternative hypothesis that Capotauro is a pair-instability supernova (PISN) originating from a massive ($250-260\,M_\odot$), metal-free star. Using state-of-the-art PISN light curves, spectral energy distributions, and synthetic spectra, we show that a PISN at $z\simeq 15$ can plausibly reproduce the observed brightness, temporal evolution, photometry, and NIRSpec spectrum. We compare this scenario with alternative interpretations, including a local Y0 brown dwarf, and discuss observational tests to discriminate among them.

This study characterizes the properties of this dynamic gas flow. Methods: Combining data from the Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) with single-dish data from the IRAM30m observatory, we mapped large spatial scales ( 81pc^2) at high angular resolution (7.0”x2.6” corresponding  2.3x10^4au or  0.1pc) down to core scales. The spectral setup in the 3mm band covers many spectral lines as well as the continuum emission. Results: The data reveal the proposed west-east converging gas flow in all observed dense gas tracers. We estimate a mass-flow rate along that flow around 10^-3M_sun/yr. Comparing these west-east flow rates to infall rates toward sources along the line of sight, the gas flow rates are roughly a factor of 25 greater than than those along the line of sight. This confirms the dominance of longitudinal motions along the converging gas flow in G28.37. For comparison, in the main north-south IRDC formed by the west-east converging gas flow, infall rates along the line of sight are about an order of magnitude greater than those along the west-east flow. In addition to the kinematic analysis, a comparison of CH_3CN-derived gas temperatures with Herschel-derived dust temperatures typically show higher gas temperatures toward high-density sources. We discuss whether mechanical heating from the conversion of the flow's kinetic energy into thermal energy may explain some of the observed temperature differences. Conclusions: The differences between flow rates along the converging flow, perpendicular to it, and toward the sources at the IRDC center indicate that at the interfaces of converging gas flows - where most of the active star formation takes place - originally more directed gas flows can convert into multidirectional infall motions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Guided Unconditional Diffusion Model to Synthesize and Inpaint Radio Galaxies from FIRST, MGCLS and Radio Zoo</a><span class="id">[2601.07485]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a masked guided approach for a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) trained to generate and inpaint realistic radio galaxy images.

While residual observational systematics and local-structure effects cannot be definitively excluded, this result motivates the exploration of alternative physical interpretations beyond the minimal $\Lambda$CDM framework. We investigate whether Scalar–Tensor–Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) can provide a consistent explanation for an enhanced large-scale anisotropic dipole without violating existing constraints from early-universe cosmology, the cosmic microwave background (CMB) dipole, galaxy dynamics, weak lensing, or the observed late-time matter power spectrum. The radio number-count dipole probes ultra-large-scale, anisotropic structure and coherent gravitational response, rather than virialized dynamics or linear growth alone. In STVG-MOG, a scale- and time-dependent effective gravitational coupling preserves standard cosmological evolution at early times and on small to intermediate scales, while amplifying gravitational response on gigaparsec scales. This scale-selective enhancement can increase the large-scale structure contribution to the radio dipole without overproducing power on smaller scales. If the observed dipole excess reflects a physical cosmological signal rather than residual systematics, STVG-MOG offers a viable and testable alternative interpretation. It is demonstrated that the radio dipole anomaly provides a novel probe of gravitational physics on the largest observable scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07543" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CASCO: Cosmological and AStrophysical parameters from Cosmological simulations and Observations IV.

We investigate the constraining power of galaxy scaling relations on cosmological, astrophysical, and WDM parameters through a joint analysis of hydrodynamic simulations and observational data. Our study is based on the DREAMS project and combines large-volume uniform-box simulations with high-resolution Milky Way zoom-in runs in a $\Lambda$WDM cosmology. To ensure consistency between the different simulation sets, we apply calibrations to account for resolution effects, allowing us to exploit the complementary strengths of the two suites. We compare simulated relations, including stellar size, DM mass and fraction within the stellar half-mass radius, and the total-to-stellar mass ratio, with two complementary galaxy samples: the SPARC catalog of nearby spirals and the LVDB catalog of dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. Using a bootstrap-based fitting procedure, we show that key cosmological parameters ($\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$) and supernova feedback strength can be recovered with good accuracy, particularly from the uniform-box simulations. While the WDM particle mass remains unconstrained, the zoom-in simulations reveal subtle WDM-induced trends at low stellar masses in both the DM mass and total-to-stellar mass ratio. We also find that the galaxy stellar mass function exhibits a measurable dependence on the WDM particle mass below log10(M_*/Msun) &lt;  8, which appears separable from the impact of feedback, suggesting it as a promising complementary probe. Our results highlight the importance of combining multi-resolution simulations with diverse observational datasets to jointly constrain baryonic processes and DM properties.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07555" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isochrone Fitting of Galactic Globular Clusters – VII.

We fit various colour–magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the clusters using isochrones from the DSED and BaSTI. The CMDs are constructed from data sets provided by the HST, Gaia, SMSS, a large compilation of Stetson, and other sources, using multiple filters for each cluster. Our cross-identification of almost all the data sets with those from Gaia or HST allows us to use their astrometry to precisely select cluster members in all the data sets. We obtain the following estimates, along with their total uncertainties, for NGC288, NGC362, NGC1904, NGC4372, NGC5904, NGC6205 and NGC6218, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.28$, $-1.26$, $-1.64$, $-2.28$, $-1.33$, $-1.56$, and $-1.27$ dex; ages $12.94$, $10.33$, $13.16$, $12.81$, $11.53$, $12.75$, and $13.03$ Gyr; distances $8.83$, $9.00$, $12.66$, $5.17$, $7.24$, $7.39$, and $4.92$ kpc; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.022$, $0.029$, $0.031$, $0.545$, $0.045$, $0.024$, and $0.210$ mag; extinctions $Av=0.09$, $0.09$, $0.11$, $1.58$, $0.13$, $0.09$, and $0.67$ mag; and extinction-to-reddening ratio $Rv=3.9$, $3.0$, $3.8$, $2.9$, $2.9$, $3.6$, and $3.2$. We confirm that the differences in horizontal branch morphology among the 16 Galactic globular clusters analysed in our studies can be explained by variations in their metallicity, age, mass-loss efficiency, and the loss of low-mass members during cluster evolution. Accordingly, most clusters indicate a relatively high mass-loss efficiency, consistent with the Reimers mass-loss law with $\eta&gt;0.3$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07604" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy Mergers in UNIONS – II: Predicting Timescales in the Post-Merger Regime</a><span class="id">[2601.07604]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy mergers are critical events that influence galaxy evolution by driving processes such as enhanced star formation, quenching, and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. However, constraining the timescales over which these processes occur in the post-merger phase has remained a significant challenge. This study extends the MUlti-Model Merger Identifier (\textsc{Mummi}) framework to predict post-merger timescales ($T_{PM}$) for galaxies, leveraging machine learning models trained on realism-enhanced mock observations derived from the IllustrisTNG simulations. By classifying post-merger galaxies into four temporal bins spanning 0 to 1.76 Gyr after coalescence, \textsc{Mummi} achieves time classification accuracies exceeding 70 per cent. We apply this framework to the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), yielding a catalog of 8,716 post-merger galaxies with $T_{PM}$ predictions and stellar masses $\log(M_*/M_\odot) \geq 10$ at redshifts 0.03 &lt; z &lt; 0.3. These results provide a robust methodology to connect galaxy interaction timescales with physical processes, enabling detailed studies of galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07623" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Impact of Nuclear Reaction Rates on Calcium Production in Population III Stars: A Global Analysis</a><span class="id">[2601.07623]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the sensitivity of calcium production to nuclear reaction rates of a 40 solar-mass Population III star using 1D multi-zone stellar models. A comprehensive nuclear reaction network was constructed, and all $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reaction rates were individually varied by a factor of 10 up and down, identifying 13 preliminary key reactions for calcium production. To propagate the reaction rate uncertainties on calcium production, two sets of Monte Carlo simulations were performed for these key reactions: one adopting STARLIB reaction rates and the other incorporating updated rates from recent experimental data and evaluations. Our results show that Monte Carlo simulations using the updated rates show good agreement with the observed calcium abundance of the extremely iron-poor star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3 within the 68% confidence interval predicted by the models. In contrast, the observed calcium abundance lies marginally outside the 68% C.I. when using the STARLIB rates. Spearman rank-order correlation analysis and SHAP values show that the $(p,\gamma)$ and $(p,\alpha)$ reactions of F18 and F19 exhibit strong coupled effects on calcium production. These reaction-rate uncertainties need to be reduced to constrain the stellar model predictions. Our study provides insights for future nuclear physics experiments aimed at reducing reaction rate uncertainties in the nucleosynthesis of Population III Stars. Additionally, comparisons between 20 solar-mass and 40 solar-mass Population III stellar models confirm that the latter, with updated reaction rates, is more capable of reproducing the observed Ca abundance and [Ca/Mg] ratio.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Core Scouring Dynamics and Gravitational Wave Consequences: Constraints on Supermassive Black Hole Binary Hardening</a><span class="id">[2601.07762]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this paper we perform a multi-messenger investigation of the efficiency of stellar scattering in tightening supermassive black hole binaries by jointly comparing models to the observed galaxy stellar core population and to results of nanohertz gravitational wave observations. Our model uses merger trees from the IllustrisTNG cosmological suite of simulations to predict stellar mass deficits in core galaxies. We take into account dynamical friction, stellar scattering, and gravitational wave emission and compare to the observed relation between core mass deficit and galaxy stellar mass. We find that to match observations, binary hardening in the stellar scattering regime must be about 1.6 times faster than N-body experiments suggest. Most importantly we find that, even assuming a full loss-cone, hardening by stellar scattering alone is insufficient to explain the low frequency turnover seen in the gravitational wave background. This strongly suggests that gas-dynamics play an important role in hardening and provides a reason to be optimistic about electromagnetically visible binary AGN.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07799" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing subhalo abundance matching with galaxy kinematics</a><span class="id">[2601.07799]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rotation velocities of disc galaxies trace dark matter halo structure, providing direct constraints on the galaxy–halo connection. We construct a Bayesian forward model to connect the dark matter halo population predicted by $\Lambda$CDM with an observed sample of disc galaxies (SPARC) through their maximum rotation velocities. Our approach combines a subhalo abundance matching scheme (accounting for assembly bias) with a parameterised halo response to galaxy formation. When assuming no correlation between selection in the SPARC survey and halo properties, reproducing the observed velocities requires strong halo expansion, low abundance matching scatter ($&lt;0.15$ dex at $1\sigma$) and a halo proxy that strongly suppresses the stellar masses in satellite haloes. This is in clear tension with independent clustering constraints. Allowing for SPARC-like galaxies to preferentially populate low $\Vmax$ haloes at fixed virial mass greatly improves the goodness-of-fit and resolves these tensions: the preferred halo response shifts to mild contraction, the abundance matching scatter increases to $\sint = 0.19^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ dex and the proxy becomes consistent with clustering. However, the inferred selection threshold is extreme, implying that SPARC galaxies occupy the lowest ${\sim}16$ per cent of the $\Vmaxhalo$ distribution at fixed $\Mvir$. Moreover, even with selection, the inferred scatter remains in statistical disagreement with the low-mass clustering constraints, which are most representative of the SPARC galaxies in our sample. Our analysis highlights the advantage of augmenting clustering-based constraints on the galaxy–halo connection with kinematics and suggests a possible tension using current data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07818" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmoglobe DR2. V. Spatial correlations between thermal dust and ionized carbon emission in Planck HFI and COBE-DIRBE</a><span class="id">[2601.07818]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We fit five tracers of thermal dust emission to ten Planck HFI and COBE-DIRBE frequency maps between 353 GHz and 25 THz, aiming to map the relative importance of each physical host environment as a function of frequency and position on the sky. Four of these correspond to classic thermal dust tracers, namely H i (HI4PI), CO (Dame et al. 2001a), H{\alpha} (WHAM, Haffner et al. (2003a, 2016)), and dust extinction (Gaia; Edenhofer et al. 2024), while the fifth is ionized carbon (C ii) emission as observed by COBE- FIRAS. We jointly fit these five templates to each frequency channel through standard multi-variate linear regression. At frequencies higher than 1 THz, we find that the dominant tracer is in fact C ii, and above 10 THz this component accounts for almost the entire fitted signal; at frequencies below 1 THz, its importance is second only to H i. We further find that all five components are well described by a modified blackbody spectral energy density (SED) up to some component-dependent maximum frequency ranging between 1 and 5 THz. In this interpretation, the C ii-correlated component is the hottest among all five, with an effective temperature of about 25 K. The H{\alpha} component has a temperature of 18 K, and, unlike the other four, is observed in absorption rather than emission. Despite the simplicity of this model, which relies only on external templates coupled to spatially isotropic SEDs, we find that it captures 98 % of the full signal root mean squared (RMS) below 1 THz. This high efficiency suggests that spatial variations in the thermal dust SED, as for instance reported by Planck and other experiments, may be more economically modelled on large angular scales in terms of a spatial mixing of individually isotropic physical components.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07822" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmoglobe DR2.

Following a companion analysis of Planck HFI, the four components of this model correspond to &quot;hot dust&quot;, &quot;cold dust&quot;, &quot;nearby dust&quot;, and &quot;Halpha correlated dust&quot;, respectively, and each component is modelled in terms of a fixed spatial template and a spatially isotropic spectral energy density (SED) defined by an overall free amplitude for each DIRBE channel. Except for the cold dust amplitude, which is only robustly detected in the 240 micron channel, we measure statistically significant template amplitudes for all components in all DIRBE channels between 12 and 240 micron. In the 3.5 and 4.9 micron channels, only the hot component is detected, while the 1.25 and 2.2 micron channels are too dominated by starlight emission to allow robust dust detections. The total number of DIRBE-specific degrees of freedom in this model is 25. Despite this low dimensionality, the resulting total SED agrees well with recent astrodust predictions. At both low and high frequencies, more than 95 % of the frequency map variance is captured by the model, while at 60 and 100 micron about 70 % of the signal variance is successfully accounted for. The hot dust component, which in a companion paper has been found to correlate strongly with C ii emission, has the highest absolute amplitude in all DIRBE frequency channels; in particular, at 3.5 micron, which is known to be dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, this component accounts for at least 80 % of the total signal. This analysis represents an important step towards establishing a joint concordance model of thermal dust emission applicable to both the microwave and infrared regimes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07831" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmoglobe DR2.

We include two classes of compact objects, namely bright stars with individual spectral energy densities (SEDs) measured by \textit{Gaia}, and a combined diffuse background of dim point source emission. Of the 424\ 829 bright sources that we fit, the number of stars with a flux density detected by WISE at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;20^{\circ}$ at more than $5\,\sigma$ is 94 680, for an average of 1.36 stars per DIRBE beam area. For each star, we adopt physical parameters ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, and [M/H]) from \textit{Gaia}; use these to identify a best-fit effective SED with the PHOENIX stellar model library; convolve with the respective DIRBE bandpass; and fit an overall free amplitude per star within the Bayesian end-to-end \texttt{Cosmoglobe} DR2 framework. The contributions from faint sources are accounted for by coadding all 710\ 825\ 587 WISE sources not included as bright stars, and fit one single overall amplitude per DIRBE band. Based on this model we find that total star emission accounts for 91 \% of the observed flux density at 2.2 $\mu$m; 54 \% at 4.9$\,\mu$m; and 1 \% at 25 $\mu$m. As shown in companion papers, this new model is sufficiently accurate to support high-precision measurements of both the Cosmic Infrared Background monopole and zodiacal light emission in the three highest DIRBE frequencies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06592" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matière noire et (ou) gravitation modifiée : une approche historique et épistémologique</a><span class="id">[2601.06592]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The current standard model of cosmology assumes that the majority of matter in the Universe is made of dark matter, and that the latter is fundamentally different from ordinary matter.

In inviscid flows within the stable wavenumber region $k$, no regular eigenmodes exist – the frequency spectrum $\omega$ consists of a continuous set of singular van Kampen modes with real frequencies. Nevertheless, initial perturbations of the total vorticity integrated across the flow decay exponentially, resembling the behavior of an eigenmode with complex eigenfrequency ${\rm Im}\,\omega&lt;0$ (Landau damping). However, the vorticity itself does not decay but becomes increasingly corrugated across the flow. We demonstrate that accounting for arbitrarily small viscosity transforms this exponentially decaying perturbation into a true eigenmode in which the vorticity preserves its spatial form. We numerically trace the transformation of the vorticity structure of this mode and its disappearance as viscosity approaches zero. We discuss similarities and differences between the behavior of damped perturbations in the transition from inviscid to nearly inviscid flows in hydrodynamics and their behavior in plasma and homogeneous stellar systems during the analogous transition from collisionless to very weakly collisional systems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10613" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring the interplay between star formation efficiency and dust in regulating the UV luminosity of early systems in the JWST and ALMA era</a><span class="id">[2409.10613]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations by the James Webb Telescope (JWST) have unveiled numerous galaxy candidates between $z \sim 9 - 16.5$, hinting at an over-abundance of sources at the bright-end of the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF) at z $\gtrsim$ 11. Complementarily, the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) has started yielding dust mass estimates at $z \sim 5 - 7$. In this work, we develop an analytic formalism baselined against the latest ALMA results, jointly exploring the impact of bursty star formation and its associated dust enrichment, on the visibility of early galaxies, while also modelling sources scattered off the main sequence of star formation. We incorporate dust production in type II Supernovae, dust destruction, ejection, growth and sputtering. Our key results are: (i) explaining the UV LF at $z \sim 5 - 13$ requires an average star formation efficiency that evolves as $f_*(z) = 10^{0.13z-3.5}$, with a number of observations exceeding this main sequence by a factor of 10. (ii) The dust enrichment of early systems is driven by dust production in SNII ejecta, while growth and sputtering impact the dust mass by 60\% and 40\% respectively at $z \sim 7$. (iii) galaxies at $z \gtrsim 9$ can retain significant dust, reaching average dust-to-stellar mass ratios of 0.19\% (0.14\%) at $z \sim 9$ ($z \sim 11$). Dust attenuation decreases with redshift as dust becomes more dispersed within halos. (iv) observations by ALMA at $z \sim 5$ and 7 are not representative of the average population that makes up the UV LF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15470" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The PAU Survey: Measuring intrinsic galaxy alignments in deep wide fields as a function of colour, luminosity, stellar mass and redshift</a><span class="id">[2505.15470]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the measurements and constraints of intrinsic alignments (IA) in the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) deep wide fields, which include the W1 and W3 fields from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) and the G09 field from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS).

A separate Hubble Space Telescope program provided Advanced Camera for Surveys optical imaging contemporaneous with the second and third epochs of the NIRCam observations. The NIRSpec spectroscopy on three transients confirmed a Type Ia supernova at z=1.63 and the host galaxies of the other two at z=2.64 and 1.90, respectively. Combining these with the photometric redshifts (z_ph) of the host galaxies in the rest of the sample, we find that the transients are in either a &quot;mid-z&quot; group at z&gt;1.6 with M_V &lt; -16.0 mag or a &quot;low-z&quot; group at z &lt; 0.4 with M_H &gt; -14.0 mag. The mid-z transients are consistent with supernovae. In contrast, the low-z transients' luminosities fall in the range of the so-called &quot;gap transients&quot; between supernovae and novae. However, this latter conclusion is only tentative due to possible catastrophic failures in z_ph that could bias them to low-z. Conversely, if they are indeed at z &lt; 0.4, it would be worth studying similar transients in the future. Our work further demonstrates the power of NIRCam in transient science and also shows that it would be more fruitful to carry out a long-term monitoring program with more passbands, a higher cadence and prompt follw-up spectroscopy.

We then performed Bayesian model fits on the correlation functions to infer the Halo Occupation Distribution parameters, star formation duty cycle, and galaxy bias in three redshift bins. We examined several cases where different combinations of parameters were varied, showing that our data can constrain the slope of the satellite occupation function, which previous studies have fixed. For an $M_{\rm{UV}}$-limited sub-sample, we found galaxy bias values of $b_g=3.18^{+0.14}_{-0.14}$ at $z\simeq3$, $b_g=3.58^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ at $z\simeq4$, $b_g=4.27^{+0.25}_{-0.26}$ at $z\simeq5$.

A popular explanation is that they are a sub-population of active galactic nuclei/supermassive black holes (AGN/SMBHs) predominantly found in the high-redshift Universe ($z\gtrsim3$). Similarly, direct collapse black holes (DCBHs), theorized to form from collapsing massive, extremely metal-poor gas clouds, have been invoked to explain high-redshift quasars, the most massive AGN sub-population. Here, we employ the semi-analytical code A-SLOTH to produce a population of DCBHs and compare them against observed LRD demographics and properties. Specifically, we compare the DCBH-seeded SMBH population against the standard stellar-remnant seeds and find that DCBH models agree better with observed LRD population statistics and host halo properties. Furthermore, for the most extreme and earliest LRD detections, interpreted to be systems with an AGN but little stellar component, DCBHs are able to reproduce the observed spectral shape and properties under multiple scenarios - high dust attenuation or AGN surrounded by dense gas - that have been proposed to explain the unique shape of LRD spectra. Even when super-Eddington accretion, invoked previously to explain the nature of LRDs, is enforced on stellar remnant seeds, the spectral characteristics of extreme LRDs cannot be reproduced.

We sample the posterior over Galacticus parameters with Markov Chain Monte Carlo and show that the resulting calibration reproduces the low-redshift SMF. We then extend the method to additional datasets, using a higher-redshift SHMR and the low-redshift stellar mass-size relation as examples, and assess performance for large scale structure survey-relevant properties: stellar masses, sizes, and emission-line strengths. The SMF matches data well at low redshift, but toward higher redshift the model yields too few massive galaxies and too many low-mass galaxies. Size evolution with redshift is approximately correct, but the mass-size relation is too flat, producing massive galaxies that are too small. The H$\alpha$ luminosity function is well reproduced at z 2, but by z 0.4 the model overproduces highly star-forming, H$\alpha$-bright systems. These discrepancies suggest the model lacks sufficient flexibility (e.g. in gas cooling/recycling or feedback) to reconcile all datasets simultaneously. Our strategy complements emulator-based methods for calibrating semi-analytic models by enabling rapid, low-cost scans of model choices and parameterisations - a capability we envision leveraging to supply calibrated starting points for more detailed follow-up inference.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Pristine Star-Forming Complex at z=4.19</a><span class="id">[2509.07073]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a faint (M_1700   -12.2), oxygen-deficient strongly-lensed ionizing source – dubbed LAP2 (Lensed And Pristine 2) – at a spectroscopic redshift of z=4.19. LAP2 appears to be isolated and lies very close to the caustic produced by the lensing galaxy cluster Abell 2744. It was observed with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec MSA in prism mode as part of the UNCOVER program. The NIRSpec spectrum reveals prominent Lya emission (7.1 sigma), clear Ha emission (6.2 sigma), tentative Hb emission (2.8 sigma), and no detectable [OIII]4959,5007 (  7 times fainter than Ha). The inferred [OIII] 2 sigma upper limit corresponds to an R3 index &lt;0.85 (assuming the Ha/Hb   2.86 case B recombination ratio), which, under high-ionization conditions, implies a metallicity of Z &lt; 6 X 10^(-3) Z_sun. The combination of faint ultraviolet luminosity, large rest-frame Ha equivalent width (  650 A), and extremely compact size (&lt; 10 pc) suggests that LAP2 is being caught in an early, pristine formation phase consistent with an instantaneous-burst scenario, with an estimated stellar mass of at most a few 10^4 Msun. Deep VLT/MUSE observations further reveal copious Lya emission forming an arclet that straddles the critical line. LAP2 thus joins the rare class of extremely metal-poor star-forming complexes that JWST has started to unveil at redshifts 3 - 7, and provides a rare glimpse into a still very poorly explored faint-luminosity regime.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Measuring the Central Dark Mass in NGC 4258 with JWST/NIRSpec Stellar Kinematics</a><span class="id">[2509.20519]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new stellar dynamical measurement of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4258, a critical benchmark for extragalactic mass measurements. We use archival JWST/NIRSpec IFU data (G235H/F170LP grating) to extract high-resolution two-dimensional stellar kinematics from the CO bandhead absorption features within the central $3'' \times 3''$. We extract the stellar kinematics after correcting for instrumental artifacts and separating the stellar light from the non-thermal AGN continuum. We employ Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM) to fit the observed kinematics, exploring a grid of 12 models to systematically test the impact of different assumptions for the point-spread function, stellar mass-to-light ratio ($M/L$) profile, and orbital anisotropy. All 12 models provide broadly acceptable fits, albeit with minor differences. The ensemble median and 68% (1$\sigma$) bootstrap confidence intervals of our 12 models yield a black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH} = (4.08^{+0.19}_{-0.33}) \times 10^7$ M$_\odot$. This paper showcases the utility of using the full model ensemble to robustly account for systematic uncertainties, rather than relying on formal errors from a single preferred model, as has been common practice. Our result is just 5% larger than, and consistent with, the benchmark SMBH mass derived from water maser dynamics, validating the use of NIRSpec stellar kinematics for robust SMBH mass determination. Our analysis demonstrates JWST's capability to resolve the SMBH's sphere of influence and deliver precise dynamical masses, even in the presence of significant AGN continuum emission.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11772" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MESA-QUEST: Tracing the formation of direct collapse black hole seeds via quasi-stars</a><span class="id">[2510.11772]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The origin of the first supermassive black holes (SMBHs) observed at redshifts $z\geq 9$ remains one of the most challenging open questions in astrophysics. Their rapid emergence suggests that massive “heavy seeds” must have formed early, possibly through the direct collapse of pristine gas clouds in the first galaxies. We present MESA-QUEST, a new framework built upon the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, designed to model the structure and evolution of quasi-stars – massive, radiation-supported envelopes hosting accreting black holes at their cores – believed to be the progenitors of direct-collapse black hole (DCBH) seeds. Our implementation introduces flexible boundary conditions representing both Bondi accretion and saturated-convection regimes, and explores the impact of several stellar wind and mass-loss prescriptions, including Reimers, Dutch, and super-Eddington radiation-driven winds. We find that quasi-stars can grow central black holes to $\geq 10^3\,M_{\odot}$ under favorable conditions, with saturated-convection models yielding BH-to-total mass ratios up to 0.55$M_*$ – five times higher than Bondi-limited cases. However, strong radiation-driven winds can dramatically curtail growth, potentially quenching heavy-seed formation unless balanced by sustained envelope accretion. Our results delineate the physical limits under which quasi-stars can remain stable and produce heavy seeds capable of evolving into the earliest SMBHs detected by JWST and Chandra. Future extensions will incorporate rotation, magnetic fields, and GR-radiation hydrodynamics to refine accretion physics and constrain the viability of the quasi-star pathway for early SMBH formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17952" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots</a><span class="id">[2510.17952]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (${z\sim3-10}$) objects referred to as “Little Red Dots” (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&amp;K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their “late-stage” which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\sim 20$ Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23549" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Vine: High abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster at z=3.44</a><span class="id">[2510.23549]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z&gt;3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)&gt;10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04119" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine-Learning Estimation of Energy Fractions in MHD Turbulence Modes</a><span class="id">[2511.04119]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence plays a central role in many astrophysical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation and cosmic-ray transport and acceleration. MHD turbulence can be decomposed into three fundamental modes-fast, slow, and Alfvén-each contributing differently to the dynamics of the medium. However, characterizing and separating the energy fractions of these modes was challenging due to the limited 2D information available from observations. To address this difficulty, we use 3D isothermal and multiphase MHD turbulence simulations to examine how mode energy fractions vary under different physical conditions. Overall, we find that the Alfvén and slow modes carry comparable kinetic-energy fractions and together dominate the turbulent energy budget in multiphase media, while the fast mode contributes the smallest fraction. Relative to isothermal conditions, multiphase simulations exhibit an enhanced fast-mode energy fraction. We further introduce a machine-learning-based approach that employs a conditional Residual Neural Network to infer these fractions directly from spectroscopic data. The method leverages the fact that the three MHD modes imprint distinct morphological signatures in spectroscopic maps owing to their differing contributions to density and velocity fluctuations. Our model is trained on a suite of isothermal and multiphase simulations covering typical ISM conditions. We demonstrate that our machine learning model can recover the mode fractions from spectroscopic observables, achieving mean relative normalized errors of approximately 0 and standard deviation of 0.01 - 0.02 for seen data and 0.1 - 1.8 for unseen data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SN 2016iog: A fast declining Type II-L supernova with an ultra-faint tail, persistently interacting with circumstellar material</a><span class="id">[2511.12929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present optical photometric and spectroscopic observations of the rapidly declining Type IIL supernova (SN) 2016iog. SN 2016iog reached its peak $\sim$ 14 days after explosion, with an absolute magnitude in the $V$ band of $-18.64 \pm 0.15$ mag, followed by a steep decline of $8.85 \pm 0.15$ mag (100 d)$^{-1}$ post-peak. Such a high decline rate makes SN 2016iog one of the fastest declining Type IIL SNe observed to date. The rapid rise in the light curve, combined with the nearly featureless continuum observed in the spectrum at +9.3 days, suggests the presence of interaction. In the recombination phase, we observed broad H$\alpha$ lines that persist at all epochs. In addition, the prominent double-peaked H$\alpha$ feature observed in the late-time spectrum (+190.8 days) is likely attributable either to significant dust formation within a cool dense shell or to asymmetric circumstellar material. These features suggest the presence of sustained interaction around SN 2016iog. We propose that the observed characteristics of SN 2016iog can be qualitatively explained by assuming a low-mass H-rich envelope surrounding a red supergiant progenitor star with low-density circumstellar material.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">61.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21840" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The HITRAN2024 methane update</a><span class="id">[2511.21840]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Spectroscopic parameters of methane from many different studies were gathered to improve the HITRAN database towards its 2024 version.

These changes amount to 51,000 transition wavenumbers, 18,000 line intensities, 33,000 pressure-broadening half-widths, and 3300 assignments. 44,000 new lines were added with 16,000 old lines removed, extending the database from 12,000 cm$^{-1}$ up to 14,000 cm$^{-1}$, and covering some gaps. A greater focus was brought on the pentad, octad, and tetradecad regions, targeted by several remote sensing instruments. In these regions, comparisons of spectral fits from multiple line lists were performed, taking only the parameters that provide best fit for each line. In the $\nu _3$ band, in addition to replacing the previous values, speed-independent pressure broadening parameters of $^{12}$CH$_4$ were gathered and used to fit Padé-approximant functions. These functions then replaced any outdated experimental data in $\nu _3$, missing data in the new lines, as well as the values that were determined to be outside their physical boundaries. The CH$_3$D broadening parameters were replaced in the same manner, for missing and low or high values, using a semi-empirical formula instead.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">62.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02106" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JCMT Constraints on the Early-Time HCN and CO Emission and HCN Temporal Evolution of 3I/ATLAS</a><span class="id">[2512.02106]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Interstellar objects (ISOs), particularly those with cometary activity, provide unique insight into the primordial physical and chemical conditions present during the formation of the planetary system in which they originated.

Here we present observations of the third ISO, 3I/ATLAS, with the `Ū`ū heterodyne receiver on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), which targeted emission from HCN($J = 3 - 2$) and CO($J = 2 - 1$). Our observations, taken between 16 July 2025 and 21 July 2025 (UT), when 3I/ATLAS was at a heliocentric distance between 4.01 and 3.84 au, provide the earliest sub-mm constraints on its activity. We do not detect HCN or CO in these epochs, with 3$\sigma$ upper-limits on the production rates of $Q(HCN) &lt; 1.7 \times 10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 4.01 - 3.97$ au and $Q(CO) &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ at $r_h = 3.94 - 3.84$ au, respectively. We combine this HCN limit with later JCMT observations of HCN to constrain its temporal evolution. Fitting the HCN detections with a $Q(HCN) \propto r_h^{-n}$ model and accounting for the upper-limits yields $n = 12.7^{+6.9}_{-2.5}$.

Comparing their narrow-lines (NL) to Seyfert2s in line-ratio diagrams, most of the NL of strong Sy 1.0 and Sy 1.2s (with dominant broad lines) are the same as those of pure Sy2s. In contrast, only 25-30 percent of the Sy1.8 and Sy1.9 nuclei (with weak broad lines) are located in the pure Sy2 region, with the rest falling in the composite-star-forming region. We explain these Seyfert-plus-star-formation spectra with a simple model. It shows that 85 percent of NL in Sy1.9 are from HII-regions, while 88 percent of the NL in Sy 1.0 arise from the same NLR as in pure Sy2. About 6 percent of the strong and weak Sy1's have NL dominated by LINER emission, while 15 percent of intermediate Seyferts (Sy 1.5 and Sy 1.6) do. To confirm this Seyfert 1 AGN plus star formation combination, we used stellar absorption-lines to compare their stellar populations. Their Hdelta strengths show that LINERs, pure Sy2s, and also the broad-line dominated Sy1s have old stellar populations. The weak Sy 1s show stronger Hdelta absorption, indicating larger proportions of young stars. About one third of the u band light in Sy1.0 and 1.2 is blended Balmer lines and continuum from the BLR. The NL gas reddening increases as the BLR strength decreases, from Sy1.0 (0.13 mag), to Sy1.9 (0.40 mag), to Sy2s and LINERs both with 0.50 mag. Our data do not support the simplest version of Seyfert 1 and 2 unification, where both AGN classes have identical NL.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ExoMol line lists – LXIII: ExoMol line lists for 12 isotopologues of CO$_2$</a><span class="id">[2512.13889]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Extensive rovibrational line lists are constructed for 12 isotopologues of carbon dioxide: $^{12}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{16}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{17}$O$_2$, $^{12}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{13}$C$^{18}$O$_2$, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{17}$O, $^{16}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O, $^{17}$O$^{12}$C$^{18}$O, and $^{17}$O$^{13}$C$^{18}$O.

We tested whether OI 8446, attributed to Bowen fluorescence driven by Ly$\beta$ pumping, varied on short (day- to week-long) timescales during a 2016 HST/STIS campaign of NGC 4593, and examined how it relates to other emission lines and the ionizing UV continuum. We quantified the variability of OI 8446 by calculating its rms amplitude. We then extracted integrated light curves of OI 8446 and other UV and optical emission lines, and compared them with each other and with the UV continuum light curve using correlation analyses. In addition, we used archival near-infrared spectra to assess the dominant excitation mechanism of OI 8446. We detect, for the first time, variability in OI 8446 on day timescales. The fractional rms amplitude is $\sim 4$% over the 4-week campaign. The OI 8446 light curve reverberates with a delay of $\sim 2.5$ days relative to Ly$\alpha$, used as a proxy for Ly$\beta$, detected at a false-alarm probability of 0.6% (significance of $\sim 2.8\sigma$) under our adopted null hypothesis. It closely tracks H$\alpha$ with only a minor additional delay of $\sim0.3$ days, placing its emission region at essentially the same distance as the Balmer-line weighted BLR. Line ratios indicate that Ly$\beta$ pumping is the dominant excitation mechanism for O I 8446. Our results establish OI 8446 as the first Bowen-fluorescence line reverberation-mapped, responding directly to variations in Ly$\beta$ flux. We propose that in future campaigns targeting AGN with larger BLRs, O I could enable dual-driver RM using both the continuum and the pumping line as drivers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">66.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03080" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Long Tidal Feature Extending from a Low-Redshift Galaxy Revealed in Rubin Data Preview 1 Imaging</a><span class="id">[2601.03080]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the Vera C.

However, true solar system analog planets remain inaccessible. A major goal for exoplanet science over the coming decades is to observe, and characterize, temperate rocky planets and cool gas giants in orbit around solar-type stars, with the prospect of detecting signs of habitability or even life. Characterization and categorization of these planets relies on direct spectroscopic observations capable of identifying molecular species in their atmospheres; however, these observations represent a substantial engineering challenge due to the extreme contrast between a temperate, Earth-sized exoplanet and its parent star. NASA's next flagship mission, the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) - planned for launch in the mid-2040s - will boast a coronagraphic instrument capable of reaching the needed 10$^{-10}$ contrast, on an ultrastable platform enabling long integration times to achieve the required signal to noise. HWO will cover near-ultraviolet to the near-infrared wavelengths, enabling detections of key biosignature molecules and habitability indicators such as ocean glint and a vegetation `red edge'. Via early involvement in this groundbreaking observatory, including a potential UK instrument contribution, the UK exoplanet community now has an important opportunity to influence the telescope's design. To maintain our international competitiveness, we must be at the forefront of observational campaigns with HWO when it eventually launches, and this comes with the need for parallel development in laboratory astrophysics and computational modelling. Maximising our exploitation of this transformative NASA mission requires consistent financial support in these areas across the next two decades.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transiting exoplanets as the immediate future for population-level atmospheric science</a><span class="id">[2601.06236]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The transit method, during which a planet's presence is inferred by measuring the reduction in flux as it passes in front of its parent star, is a highly successful exoplanet detection and characterization technique. During transit, the small fraction of starlight that passes through a planet's atmosphere emerges with the fingerprints of atmospheric gases, aerosols and structure. During eclipse, the relatively small contribution of light from the planet itself may be observed as the planet is occulted by the star. For planets in near-edge-on, short-period orbits, observing the system throughout an entire orbit allows the varying flux from the planet to be extracted as the illuminated `dayside' rotates in and out of view. With spectroscopic observations, we can characterize not only the overall composition of the atmosphere, but also glean insights into atmospheric structure and dynamics. With over 6,000 transiting planets now discovered, such observations are currently our only window into a consistent sample of planetary atmospheres large enough to attempt a population-level study, a critical next step for our understanding of atmospheric science. The vast exoplanet population provides a laboratory for atmospheric physics, including chemistry, dynamics, cloud processes and evolution; extending these results to a larger number of targets will allow us to explore the effects of equilibrium temperature, gravity, mass and parent star type on atmospheric properties, as well as map observable trends to formation scenarios.

We advocate the development of a UV spectrograph that is capable of moderate- to high-resolution spectroscopy of point sources, access to key spectral features between 1000 and 3000 Angstrom, and UV detectors that are resilient to high count rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">70.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06342" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incorporating Wavefront Error, Wavefront Sensing and Control, and Sensitivities into Exposure Time Calculations for Future Space Missions with the Error Budget Software (EBS)</a><span class="id">[2601.06342]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A primary goal of NASA's Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) mission concept is to explore the Habitable Zones (HZ) of  100 stellar systems and acquire spectra of  25 terrestrial-type planets (with planet/star flux ratios on the order of 1E-10) which places tight constraints on the performance of observatory systems. In particular, coronagraph instrumentation needs to be matured for higher throughput, deeper contrasts, and better broadband performance, while also considering their sensitivity and ability to mitigate the impact of telescope instability and wavefront error (WFE), which can have a profound impact on exo-Earth imaging. The success of various proposed HWO mission architectures is often represented by the estimated exo-Earth candidate yield. Computation of the minimum exposure time to achieve the required signal-to-noise on a given target, using an exposure time calculator (ETC), is a key part of yield estimation. The impacts of coronagraph sensitivity, WFE, and wavefront sensing and control (WFS&amp;C) have been well studied in the context of developing error budgets for missions and instruments such as the Roman Coronagraph Instrument, but there is currently no easily accessible way to incorporate the effects of these key parameters into calculating exposure times for HWO. To address this, we developed the Error Budget Software (EBS) - an open-source tool that synthesizes sensitivity, WFE, and WFS&amp;C information for a variety of temporal and spatial scales and directly interfaces with the open-source yield code EXOSIMS to produce exposure times. We demonstrate how EBS can be used for mission error budgeting using the example of the Ultrastable Observatory Roadmap Team (USORT) observatory design. This includes both single and multi-variate parameter explorations using EBS where we identify trends between raw contrast and wavefront error, and detector noise and energy resolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">71.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06386" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA Decadal Astrobiology Research and Exploration Strategy (NASA-DARES 2025) White Paper – Habitable Worlds Observatory Living Worlds Science Cases: Research Gaps and Needs</a><span class="id">[2601.06386]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Executive Summary: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is the first astrophysics flagship mission with a key cross-divisional astrobiology science goal of searching for signs of life on rocky planets beyond our solar system. The Living Worlds Working Group under the Science, Technology, and Architecture Review Team (START) was charged with investigating how HWO could characterize potentially habitable exoplanets orbiting stars in the solar neighborhood, search for signs of life, and interpret potential biosignatures within a false positive and false negative framework. In particular, we focused on (1) identifying biosignatures that have spectral features in the UV-Vis-NIR wavelength range and defining their measurement requirements, (2) determining additional information needed from the planet and planet system to interpret biosignatures and assess the likelihood of false positives, and (3) assembling current knowledge of likely HWO target stars and identify which properties of host stars and systems are most critical to know in advance of HWO. The Living Worlds atmospheric biosignatures science case is considered one of the key drivers in the design of the observatory. An additional 10 astrobiology science cases were developed that collectively revealed key research gaps and needs required to fully explore the observatory parameter space and perform science return analyses. Investment in these research gaps will require coordination across the Science Mission Directorate and fall under the purview of the new Division-spanning astrobiology strategy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In-ice Radio Signatures of Cosmic Ray Particle Cascades</a><span class="id">[2601.06417]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>To detect ultra-high-energy neutrinos, experiments such as the Askaryan Radio Array and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland target the radio emission induced by these particles as they cascade in the ice, using deep in-ice antennas at the South Pole or in Greenland. A crucial step toward this goal is the characterization of the in-ice radio emission from cosmic-ray-induced particle showers. These showers form a primary background for neutrino searches, but can also be used to validate the detection principle and provide calibration signals for in-ice radio detectors. In this work, we use the Monte-Carlo framework FAERIE to perform the first characterization of cosmic ray signals with simulations that incorporate both their in-air and in-ice emissions. We investigate cosmic ray signatures such as their radiation energy, timing, polarization and frequency spectrum and quantify how they depend on shower properties.

Accurate photometric calibration of astronomical photographic plates remains a fundamental challenge in astronomy, especially when bridging historical photographic data with modern observations due to the mismatch of spectral sensitivities of photographic plates and passbands of modern calibration catalogs. Aims. We intend to derive consistent natural magnitudes for celestial sources within the intrinsic photometric systems of astronomical photographic plates by using Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) blue photometer (BP) and red photometer (RP) low-resolution spectral data and to show its superiority to former methods. Methods. We compiled spectral characteristic data for emulsions and filters applied in photometric observations using glass plates. The collected color sensitivities, modified by atmospheric reddening depending on the air mass, are then used to compute accurate natural magnitudes and fluxes of objects in the photographic plates through synthetic photometry, utilizing a catalog of Gaia spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the wavelength range 330 nm to 1050 nm (XP spectra). This process uses GaiaXPy, a Python library designed to handle Gaia DR3 spectral data. These natural magnitudes are then compared with results from the color term method used to compile the data in existing photoplate archives. Results. Comparing the synthetic magnitudes with those existing in the Archives of Photographic PLates for Astronomical USE (APPLAUSE), we were able to reveal systematic errors of the existing data in the range of +/-0.3 mag and higher. In addition, the presented method allows for an accommodation of stars with similar color index but of different luminosity classes as well as an effective correction of atmospheric reddening at higher air masses, approximately 0.2 mag.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">76.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07130" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Potential Impact of Neuromorphic Computing on Radio Telescope Observatories</a><span class="id">[2601.07130]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio astronomy relies on bespoke, experimental and innovative computing solutions. This will continue as next-generation telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) and next-generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) take shape. Under increasingly demanding power consumption, and increasingly challenging radio environments, science goals may become intractable with conventional von Neumann computing due to related power requirements. Neuromorphic computing offers a compelling alternative, and combined with a desire for data-driven methods, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising real-time power-efficient alternative. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) detection is an attractive use-case for SNNs where recent exploration holds promise. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of the potential impact of deploying varying neuromorphic approaches across key stages in radio astronomy processing pipelines for several existing and near-term instruments. Our analysis paves a realistic path from near-term FPGA deployment of SNNs in existing instruments, allowing the addition of advanced data-driven RFI detection for no capital cost, to neuromorphic ASICs for future instruments, finding that commercially available solutions could reduce the power budget for key processing elements by up to three orders of magnitude, transforming the operational budget of the observatory. High-data-rate spectrographic processing could be a well-suited target for the neuromorphic computing industry, as we cast radio telescopes as the world's largest in-sensor compute challenge.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07425" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A free-fall-based switching criterion for P^3 T N-body methods in collisional stellar systems</a><span class="id">[2601.07425]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The P$^3$T scheme is a hybrid method for simulating gravitational $N$-body systems. It combines a fast particle-tree (PT) algorithm for long-range forces with a high-accuracy particle-particle (PP, direct $N$-body) solver for short-range interactions. Preserving both PT efficiency and PP accuracy requires a robust PT-PP switching criterion. We introduce a simple free-fall-based switching criterion for general stellar systems, alongside the commonly used velocity-dispersion-based ($\sigma$-based) criterion. Using the \textsc{petar} code with the P$^3$T scheme and slow-down algorithmic regularization for binaries and higher-order multiples, we perform extensive simulations of star clusters to evaluate how each criterion affects energy conservation and binary evolution. For systems in virial equilibrium, we find that the free-fall-based criterion is generally more accurate for low-$\sigma$ or loose clusters containing binaries, whereas the $\sigma$-based criterion is better suited for high-$\sigma$ systems. Under subvirial or fractal initial conditions, both criteria struggle to maintain high energy conservation; however, the free-fall-based criterion improves as the tree timestep is reduced, whereas the $\sigma$-based degrades due to its low-accuracy treatment of two-body encounters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07439" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Advanced computing for reproducibility of astronomy Big Data Science, with a showcase of AMIGA and the SKA Science prototype</a><span class="id">[2601.07439]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) faces un- precedented technological challenges due to the vast scale and complexity of its data.

In particular, oxygen-bearing monosubstituted aromatics, likely including phenol, have been identified in the coma of comet 67P. This suggests that, earlier in the star and planet formation evolution, icy grains may act as both reservoirs and sites of functionalization for these small aromatics. We investigate the ice-phase reactivity of singlet oxygen atoms (O($^1$D)) with benzene, using ozone as a precursor that is readily photodissociated by relatively low-energy. Our experiments show that O($^1$D) efficiently reacts with benzene, forming phenol, benzene oxide, and oxepine as the main products. Phenol formation is temperature-independent, consistent with a barrierless insertion mechanism. In contrast, the formation of benzene oxide/oxepine shows a slight temperature dependence, suggesting that additional reaction pathways involving either ground-state or excited-state oxygen atoms may contribute. In H$_2$O and \COO ice matrices we find that dilution does not suppress formation of phenol. We extrapolate an experimental upper limit for the benzene-to-phenol conversion fraction of 27-44$\%$ during the lifetime of an interstellar cloud, assuming O($^1$D) production rates based on CO$_2$ ice abundances and a cosmic-ray induced UV field. We compare these estimates with a new analysis of data from the comet 67P, where the C$_6$H$_6$O/C$_6$H$_6$ ratio is 20$\pm$6$\%$. This value lies within our estimated range, suggesting that O($^1$D)-mediated chemistry is a viable pathway for producing oxygenated aromatics in cold astrophysical ices, potentially enriching icy planetesimals with phenol and other biorelevant compounds.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07708" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brightness Characterization and Modeling for Amazon Leo Satellites</a><span class="id">[2601.07708]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The mean apparent magnitude of Amazon Leo satellites is 6.28 based on 1,938 observations.

This work processes in-phase and quadrature (IQ) snapshots collected by the LuGRE receiver in cis-lunar space and on the lunar surface to assess multi-frequency, multi-constellation signal availability. Signals from additional systems beyond GPS and Galileo, including RNSS and SBAS constellations, are observable and successfully acquired exclusively in the recorded IQ snapshots. These observations provide the first experimental evidence that signals from multiple constellations, including systems not supported by LuGRE realtime operations, are detectable at unprecedented distances from Earth. Useful observables can be extracted from the IQ snapshots, despite minimal sampling rates, 4-bit quantization, and short durations (200 ms-2 s), through a hybrid coherent/non-coherent acquisition stage compensating for code Doppler. These observations are exploited to tune simulation tools and to perform extended simulation campaigns, showing that the inclusion of additional constellations significantly improves availability; for a 26 dB-Hz acquisition threshold, the fraction of epochs with at least four visible satellites increases from 11% to 46% of the total epoch count.

In this process, astronomers leverage specialized tools to analyze spectra and construct reliable catalogs. However, this practice has become the primary bottleneck, as it is fundamentally incapable of scaling with the data deluge from modern spectroscopic surveys. To bridge this gap, we propose Spec-o3, a tool-augmented vision-language agent that performs astronomer-aligned spectral inspection via interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning. Spec-o3 is trained with a two-stage post-training recipe: cold-start supervised fine-tuning on expert inspection trajectories followed by outcome-based reinforcement learning on rare-type verification tasks. Evaluated on five rare-object identification tasks from LAMOST, Spec-o3 establishes a new State-of-the-Art, boosting the macro-F1 score from 28.3 to 76.5 with a 7B parameter base model and outperforming both proprietary VLMs and specialized deep models. Crucially, the agent demonstrates strong generalization to unseen inspection tasks across survey shifts (from LAMOST to SDSS/DESI). Expert evaluations confirm that its reasoning traces are coherent and physically consistent, supporting transparent and trustworthy decision-making.

A core model within this paradigm is Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), where lightweight functions are deployed and triggered on demand, scaling seamlessly with workload. FaaS offers flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and fine-grained scalability, qualities particularly relevant for large-scale scientific infrastructures where data volumes are too large to centralise and computation must increasingly occur close to the data. The Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO) exemplifies this challenge. Once operational, it will generate about 700 PB of data products annually, distributed across the SKA Regional Centre Network (SRCNet), a federation of international centres providing storage, computing, and analysis services. In such a context, FaaS offers a mechanism to bring computation to the data. We studied the principles of serverless and FaaS computing and explored their application to radio astronomy workflows. Representative functions for astrophysical data analysis were developed and deployed, including micro-functions derived from existing libraries and wrappers around domain-specific applications. In particular, a Gaussian convolution function was implemented and integrated within the SRCNet ecosystem. The use case demonstrates that FaaS can be embedded into the existing SRCNet ecosystem of services, allowing functions to run directly at sites where data replicas are stored. This reduces latency, minimises transfers, and improves efficiency, aligning with federated, data-proximate computation. The results show that serverless models provide a scalable and efficient pathway to address the data volumes of the SKA era.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">85.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07605" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coordinate Systems and Transforms in Space Physics: Terms, Definitions, Implementations, and Recommendations for Reproducibility</a><span class="id">[2601.07605]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In space physics, acronyms for coordinate systems (e.g., \texttt{GEI}, \texttt{GSM}) are commonly used; however, differences in their definitions and implementations can prevent reproducibility.

In this work, we systematically investigate the parameter-estimation biases induced by neglecting orbital eccentricity when analyzing eccentric compact-binary coalescences with quasi-circular waveform templates. Focusing on the deci-Hertz detector B-DECIGO and the milli-Hertz detector LISA, we model eccentric inspiral signals using a frequency-domain waveform that incorporates eccentricity-induced higher harmonics and the time-dependent response of spaceborne detectors. We quantify systematic biases in the chirp mass, symmetric mass ratio, and luminosity distance using both Bayesian inference and the Fisher-Cutler-Vallisneri (FCV) formalism, and assess their significance relative to statistical uncertainties. By constructing mock gravitational-wave catalogs spanning stellar-mass and massive black-hole binaries, we identify critical initial eccentricities at which systematic errors become comparable to statistical errors. We find that for B-DECIGO, even very small eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$ at 0.1 Hz, can lead to significant biases, whereas for LISA such effects typically arise at larger eccentricities, $e_0\sim 10^{-2}-10^{-1}$ at $10^{-4}$ Hz, due to the smaller number of in-band cycles. Comparisons between FCV predictions and full Bayesian analyses demonstrate good agreement within the regime where waveform mismatches remain small, especially when extrinsic parameters are pre-aligned to minimize mismatches. Our results highlight the necessity of incorporating eccentricity in waveform models for future space-based gravitational-wave observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">87.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02644" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Needlets and foreground removal for SKAO hydrogen intensity maps</a><span class="id">[2509.02644]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Intensity Mapping (IM) of the 21-cm line of the neutral hydrogen (\textsc{Hi}) has become a compelling new technique to map the large-scale structure of the Universe.

Here, we implement a version of the Principal Component Analysis, a blind component-separation technique, based on a kind of spherical wavelets called needlets. These functions exploit double localization both in real and in harmonic space. We test Need-PCA performances on a set of maps that simulates the SKA MID radio telescope in the AA4 configuration. We compare our results with other component separation methods such as Generalised Morphological Component Analysis (GMCA) and Generalized Needlet Internal Linear Combination (GNILC). All the methods have comparable results, recovering the \textsc{Hi} signal within 10\% accuracy across the frequency channels, in the multipole range 30 $\lesssim \ell \lesssim$ 136. We also test our pipeline in the presence of systematics such as polarization leakage. We find that the cleaning methods are insensitive to the presence of such systematic, yielding the same results as in the leakage-free case. Finally, under the assumption of a realistic telescope beam with sidelobes, we find that standard PCA and GMCA fails to recover the \textsc{Hi} signal at larger scales, while the Need-PCA and Need-GMCA are less affected.

As observational data become increasingly precise, the limitations of this computationally expensive approach grow more acute, creating a pressing need for more efficient methods. In this work, we present $\texttt{Jipole}$, an automatically differentiable (AD), $\texttt{ipole}$-based code for radiative transfer in curved spacetimes, designed to compute image gradients with respect to underlying model parameters. These gradients quantify how parameter changes-such as the black hole's spin or the observer's inclination-affect the image, enabling more efficient parameter estimation and reducing the number of required images. We validate $\texttt{Jipole}$ against $\texttt{ipole}$ in two analytical tests and then compare pixel-wise intensity derivatives from AD with those from finite-difference methods. We then demonstrate the utility of these gradients by performing parameter recovery for an analytical model using a conjugate gradient optimizer in three increasingly complex cases for the injected image: ideal, blurred, and blurred with added noise. In most cases, high-accuracy fits are obtained in only a few optimization steps, failing only in cases with extremely low signal-to-noise ratios and large blurring size kernels. These results highlight the potential of AD-based methods to accelerate robust, high-fidelity model-data comparisons in current and future black hole imaging efforts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">89.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24740" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SymBoltz.jl: a symbolic-numeric, approximation-free and differentiable linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver</a><span class="id">[2509.24740]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>SymBoltz is a new Julia package that solves the linear Einstein-Boltzmann equations. It features a symbolic-numeric interface for specifying equations, is free of approximation switching schemes and is compatible with automatic differentiation. Cosmological models are built from replaceable physical components in a way that scales well in model space, or alternatively written as one compact system of equations. The modeler should simply write down their equations, and SymBoltz solves them and eliminates friction in the modeling process. Symbolic knowledge enables powerful automation of tasks, such as separating computational stages like the background and perturbations, generating the analytical Jacobian matrix and its sparsity pattern, and interpolating arbitrary variables from the solution. Implicit solvers integrate the full stiff equations at all times without approximations, which greatly simplifies the code. Performance remains as good as in existing approximation-based codes due to high-order implicit methods that take long time steps, fast generated code, optimal handling of the Jacobian and efficient sparse matrix methods. Automatic differentiation gives exact derivatives of any output with respect to any input, which is important for gradient-based Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in large parameter spaces, training of emulators, Fisher forecasting and sensitivity analysis. The main features form a synergy that reinforces the design of the code. Results agree with established codes to 0.1% with standard precision.

Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW – a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo – to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">91.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Implications of Joint Spectral Analysis of Gamma-Ray Bursts detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on Phenomenological Correlations</a><span class="id">[2510.16475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes for exploring the distant Universe, owing to their immense luminosities and detectability at high redshifts. Several empirical correlations have been established, particularly involving their energy properties. This work aims to enhance the precision of these correlations through joint spectral analysis, focusing on reducing uncertainties in both the spectral indices and the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) derived from spectral fitting. We extend previous studies using both traditional and novel spectral models, utilizing a sample of 37 GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT), incorporating the LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique, over the period 2008-2024. Our analysis compares results from joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) against those from GBM-only fits. The study focuses on fitting time-integrated ${\rm T}_{90}$ and peak flux in the rest frame. Among the observable phenomenological correlations, we revisit the Amati and Yonetoku relations: the Amati relation links the intrinsic peak energy ($E_{i,\rm p}$) to the total isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) emitted during ${\rm T}_{90}$, while the Yonetoku relation connects $E_{i,\rm p}$ to the isotropic luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$). Refining these correlations aims to deepen our understanding of GRB energetics and improve the precision of cosmological parameter estimates derived from GRB observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">92.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Large Language Models for Limited Noisy Data: A Gravitational Wave Identification Study</a><span class="id">[2512.04031]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates whether large language models (LLMs) offer advantages over traditional neural networks for astronomical data processing, in regimes with non-Gaussian, non-stationary noise and limited labeled samples. Gravitational wave observations provide an suitable test case, using only 90 LIGO events, finetuned LLMs achieve 97.4\% accuracy for identifying signals. Further experiments show that, in contrast to traditional networks that rely on large simulated datasets, additional simulated samples do not improve LLM performance, while scaling studies reveal predictable gains with increasing model size and dataset size. These results indicate that LLMs can extract discriminative structure directly from observational data and provide an efficient assessment for gravitational wave identification. The same strategy may extend to other astronomical domains with similar noise properties, such as radio or pulsar observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">93.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03341" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavity Multimodes as an Array for High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</a><span class="id">[2601.03341]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Microwave cavities operated in the presence of a background magnetic field provide a promising avenue for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs). We demonstrate for the first time that the distinct antenna patterns of multiple electromagnetic modes within a single cavity enable localization and reconstruction of key properties of an incoming HFGW signal, including its polarization ratio and frequency drift rate. Using a 9-cell cavity commonly employed in particle accelerators as a representative example, we analyze the time-domain response of 18 nearly degenerate modes, which can be sequentially excited by a frequency-drifting signal. The sensitivity is further enhanced by the number of available modes, in close analogy to the scaling achieved by a network of independent detectors, enabling sensitivity to astrophysically plausible binary sources.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">94.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine learning for radiative hydrodynamics in astrophysics</a><span class="id">[2601.05155]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radiation hydrodynamics describes the interaction between high-temperature hypersonic plasmas and the radiation they emit or absorb, a coupling that plays a central role in many astrophysical phenomena related to accretion and ejection processes. The HADES code was developed to model such systems by coupling hydrodynamics with M1-gray or M1-multigroup radiative transfer models, which are well suited to optically intermediate media. Despite its accuracy, radiation hydrodynamics simulations remain extremely demanding in terms of computational cost. Two main limitations are responsible for this. First, the M1-multigroup model relies on a closure relation with no analytic expression, requiring expensive numerical evaluations. Second, the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition strongly restricts the time step of the explicit schemes used in HADES. To overcome these difficulties, two complementary Artificial Intelligence based strategies were developed in this thesis. The first approach consists in training a Multi-Layer Perceptron to approximate the M1-multigroup closure relation. This method achieves excellent accuracy while reducing the computational cost by a factor of 3000, making it the most efficient approach currently available for this task. This performance gain enables high-fidelity simulations of radiative shocks, in which radiation directly influences the shock structure. In particular, increasing spectral resolution slows down the shock and enlarges the radiative precursor. The second approach explores the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to directly solve the radiation hydrodynamics equations and extrapolate simulations beyond their initial time range. Tests on purely hydrodynamic shocks show accurate handling of discontinuities, but application to radiative shocks remains challenging and requires further investigation.</p></div></details></article></body>
