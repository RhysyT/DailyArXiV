<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22726" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Comment on Galina Weinstein's article entitled &quot;Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincaré and Special Relativity&quot;</a><span class="id">[2509.22726]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In 2024, after thirty years of research on this subject, I published a book entitled: Poincaré, Einstein and the discovery of special relativity. An end to the controversy (Ginoux2024). In September 2025, Galina Weinstein published a review of this book entitled: Convergences and Divergences: Einstein Poincaré and Special Relativity ( arXiv:2509.09361 ) in which she aimed &quot;to show how Einstein's ether-free, principle-based kinematics marked out a path that, unlike its contemporaries, became the canonical form of special relativity.” To this end, she claimed to reconstruct &quot;in a novel way, the 1905 derivations of Einstein and Poincaré, highlighting their contrasting paths”. In her paper, she proposed a mathematical presentation of &quot;the 1905 derivations of Poincaré and Einstein”. And then, she pretended to trace &quot;their similarities and, more importantly, their differences.” Unfortunately, Weinstein's review of my book contains a number of mistakes, falsehoods and misleading criticisms that I would like to point out here. To this aim, I will follow the structure of Weinstein's paper and show section by section all the erroneous historical facts she has reported.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23047" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">From statistical dependence to the space of possible superdeterministic theories</a><span class="id">[2509.23047]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Bell's theorem demonstrates that any physical theory that is consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, and which satisfies some apparently innocuous assumptions, must violate the principle of local causality. It may therefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these other assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received significant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical independence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of SI, which states that $\rho(\lambda) \approx \rho(\lambda | Z)$, where $\rho(\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in the state $\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into apparently randomly selected sub-ensembles. SI is violated when the sub-ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda | Z)$ fails to be representative of the ensemble frequency $\rho(\lambda)$. We argue that physical theories that systematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This perspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in the superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and philosophical consequences. Regarding scope, we argue that superdeterministic theories fall into three categories, deterministic theories with fine-tuned initial conditions, fluke theories, and nomic exclusion theories. We also argue that retrocausal and invariant set theories need not violate SI, which is contrary to how they are normally presented. Regarding philosophical implications, we argue that superdeterminism is incompatible with free will according to some prominent compatibilist accounts. We also argue that although superdeterminism is conspiratorial, it is not unscientific, but pre-scientific.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22929" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leveraging generative artificial intelligence for simulation-based physics experiments: A new approach to virtual learning about the real world</a><span class="id">[2509.22929]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the impact of a novel application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in physics instruction: engaging students in prompting, refining, and validating AI-constructed simulations of physical phenomena. In a second-semester physics course for life science majors, we conducted a comparative study of three instructional approaches in a laboratory focused on electric potentials: (i) students using physical equipment, (ii) students using a prebuilt simulator, and (iii) students using AI to generate a simulation. We found significant group differences in performance on conceptual assessments of the laboratory content ({\eta}^2 = 0.359). Post-hoc analysis showed that students in both the AI-generated and prebuilt simulation conditions scored significantly higher on the conceptual assessments than students in the physical equipment condition. Students in these groups also reported more favorable perceptions of the learning experience. Finally, this preliminary study highlights opportunities for developing students' modeling skills through the processes of designing, refining, and validating AI-generated simulations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Physics Teachers' Views on Physics Education Research: A Case of Science Scepticism?</a><span class="id">[2509.24743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gap between theory and practice is well-documented in educational research. Physics teachers' willingness to apply research findings in practice may be influenced by a sceptical attitude towards science education research. This study explores physics teachers' perspectives on science education research, with a particular focus on potential scepticism towards the discipline. A two-step mixed-methods approach was employed: (1) Interviews with a purposeful sample of 13 experienced physics teachers for a first exploration of attitudes towards physics education research, and (2) a quantitative survey of 174 physics teachers to examine, among other aspects, the previously observed attitudes in a larger sample and to identify teacher profiles using latent profile analysis. The interview study revealed both sceptical and non-sceptical attitudes towards physics education research, including some that fundamentally questioned its practical value. Based on the survey data and latent profile analysis, four distinct teacher profiles differing in their level of scepticism towards science education research were identified. While one profile is highly sceptical, the other three exhibit a mix of sceptical and supportive attitudes. Thus, physics teachers are not generally sceptical. However, the cooperation between research and practice is perceived as unproductive by most teachers.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Case study examining graduate student sensemaking using the epistemic game framework for Laplace's equation in upper-level electrostatics</a><span class="id">[2509.12487]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This case study used individual interviews to investigate graduate student sense-making in upper-level electrostatics in the context of problems that can be efficiently solved for the electric potential using Laplace's equation. Although there are many technical mathematical issues involved in solving Laplace's equation, the focus of this research is not on those issues. Instead, the focus is on structural issues such as whether students recognize when solving Laplace's equation would be an effective approach to finding the potential and set up the problems correctly, and whether they can draw the electric field lines and equipotential surfaces in a given situation. Although many prior investigations have shed light on student sensemaking in the introductory physics contexts, very few investigations have focused on graduate student sensemaking while solving advanced physics problems. We present the findings of our research which was conducted through the lens of the epistemic game framework proposed by Tuminaro and Redish. We observe different nested epistemic games played by students.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23632" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blink and you'll miss it - How Technological Acceleration Shrinks SETI's Narrow Detection Window</a><span class="id">[2509.23632]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) has historically focused on detecting electromagnetic technosignatures, implicitly assuming that alien civilisations are biological and technologically analogous to ourselves. This paper challenges that paradigm, arguing that highly advanced, potentially post-biological civilisations may undergo rapid technological acceleration, quickly progressing beyond recognisable or detectable phases. We introduce a simple model showing that the technological acceleration rate of such civilisations can compress their detectable phase to mere decades, dramatically narrowing the temporal &quot;detection window&quot; in which their technosignatures overlap with our current capabilities. This framework offers a plausible resolution to the &quot;Great Silence&quot;: advanced civilisations may be abundant and long-lived, but effectively invisible to present-day SETI methods. Consequently, our efforts must include but also evolve beyond the search for narrow-band communication signals in the radio and optical domains. Instead, we require an expanded, technology-agnostic strategy focused on persistent, large-scale manifestations of intelligence, such as broadband electromagnetic leakage, waste heat from megastructures, and multi-dimensional anomaly detection across extensive, multi-wavelength and multi-messenger datasets. Leveraging advanced artificial intelligence for unsupervised anomaly discovery, recursive algorithm optimisation, and predictive modelling will be essential to uncover the subtle, non-anthropocentric traces of advanced civilisations whose technosignatures lie beyond our current technological and cognitive frameworks.</p></div></details></article></body>
