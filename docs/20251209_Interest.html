<h2>History &amp; Philosophy of Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 1.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05997" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kirchhoff`s Forgotten Contributions to Electromagnetism: Continuity Equation versus Displacement Currents</a><span class="id">[2512.05997]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In 1857, Kirchhoff published two seminal papers on the motion of electricity in wires. In that work, he was the first to derive what we now call the telegrapher`s equations, which describes the propagation of electromagnetic signals along a cable at the speed of light, in some conditions. How was Kirchhoff able to describe electromagnetic propagation as early as 1857, when the notion of displacement current which is believed to be the essential ingredient for the propagation of electric and magnetic fields was not introduced by Maxwell until 1861 and fully explained later in 1865? In this paper, we show that Kirchhoff was the first, in his 1857 paper, to introduce the continuity equation when discussing electromagnetic propagation. We argue that the continuity equation used by Kirchhoff is a more fundamental concept now as it was in 1865 than displacement current. In our view, the dynamics of charged particles can be formulated without invoking fields, but the dynamics of fields cannot be formulated without a continuity equation describing the properties of matter.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07027" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Fine-Structure Constant as a Scaled Quantity</a><span class="id">[2512.07027]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The fine-structure constant alpha approximately 1/137 is traditionally regarded as a fundamental dimensionless parameter. I argue instead that alpha is a scaled quantity that arises only where the structural scales contributed by classical electromagnetism (e), quantum mechanics (h-bar), and special relativity (c) intersect. None of these theories, taken individually, supplies the independent scales required to define alpha. The constant first appears when relativistic corrections are added to the Schrodinger-Bohr description of hydrogen (Sommerfeld), and it becomes the structural coupling in quantum electrodynamics, where quantum and relativistic effects modify the classical electromagnetic interaction. Expressing the governing laws in canonical form reveals this dependence and eliminates representational artifacts that make alpha appear fundamental. The running of alpha in QED further demonstrates its status as a scale-dependent coupling rather than a universal constant. I conclude that alpha is a domain-specific structural ratio reflecting contingent relationships among independent physical scales.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06034" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tractatus Quanticum</a><span class="id">[2512.06034]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This is a re-editing, which takes quantum mechanics into account, of Wittgenstein's famous Tractatus. The operation has a playful side in the form, but is a serious attempt to capture possible philosophical implications of the Relational Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and formalize the naturalistic third-way between realism and instrumentalism explored by this interpretation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07101" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wigner's Frame</a><span class="id">[2512.07101]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This article suggests that thinking about the role of reference frames can provide new insight into Extended Wigner's Friend scenarios. This involves appealing to symmetries to make a principled distinction between properties of a system which are meaningful only relative to an external reference system and properties which are meaningful without further relativization. Thus we may propose that there are always well-defined facts about what observers have observed, but there are not necessarily well-defined facts about the relations between their reference frames, so there will not always exist a joint distribution over their outcomes which can meaningfully be compared to the predictions of quantum mechanics. In addition, this approach also offers a general argument against the idea that there should be a regress of relativization.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Physics Education</h2><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06001" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Language Models Reshape Higher Education: Courses, Textbooks, and Teaching</a><span class="id">[2512.06001]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>While large language models (LLMs) have introduced novel paradigms in science and education, their adoption in higher education is constrained by inherent limitations. These include a tendency to produce inaccuracies and high computational requirements, which compromise the strict demands for accurate and reliable knowledge essential in higher education. Small language models (MiniLMs), by contrast, offer distinct advantages in professional education due to their lightweight nature and precise retrieval capabilities. This research takes &quot;Atmospheric Physics&quot; as an example. We established a specialized corpus and image repository by gathering over 550,000 full-text PDFs from over 130 international well-respected journals in Earth and environmental science. From this collection, we extracted over 100 million high-quality sentence-level corpus and more than 3 million high-resolution academic images. Using MiniLMs, these resources were organized into a high-dimensional vector library for precise retrieval and efficient utilization of extensive educational content. Consequently, we systematically redesigned the courses, textbooks, and teaching strategies for &quot;Atmospheric Physics&quot; based on MiniLMs. The course is designed as a &quot;interdisciplinary-frontier&quot; system, breaking down traditional boundaries between atmospheric science, space science, hydrology, and remote sensing. Teaching materials are transformed from static, lagging text formats into a dynamic digital resource library powered by MiniLM. For teaching methods, we have designed a question-based learning pathway. This paradigm promotes a shift from passive knowledge transfer to active cognitive development. Consequently, this MiniLM-driven &quot;Atmospheric Physics&quot; course demonstrates a specific avenue for &quot;AI for education&quot;.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06474" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earth radius from a single sunrise image: a classroom-ready activity</a><span class="id">[2512.06474]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using a photograph of the shadow of Mont Blanc taken from Geneva at sunrise, we derive an upper limit for the Earth radius. After presenting the observational context and the model underlying assumptions, we determine the direction of the solar rays relative to the local vertical. This direction constrains the Earth maximum diameter which – once corrected for atmospheric refraction – amounts to roughly 1.7 times its presently accepted value. This work illustrates a pedagogical approach to scientific inquiry, showing how simple observations, combined with reasoning and elementary mathematical and geometrical tools, can yield meaningful physical estimates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06923" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;Be Better Than You Need to Be&quot;: A-Level Physics Students' Rants, Resilience and Peer Pedagogy on TikTok</a><span class="id">[2512.06923]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Amid the growth of social media, students increasingly turn to short-form platforms for study support and advice. This study examines how A-level Physics is portrayed by student creators on TikTok, a popular platform amongst students for peer-to-peer educational guidance, information sharing, and collective knowledge building. Using reflexive thematic analysis of 57 TikTok videos via #alevelphysics, we explore how A-level Physics is characterised and what pathways to success are constructed within these informal discourses. The findings show that the subject is depicted as both intellectually demanding and emotionally taxing, with the examination system perceived as a flawed gatekeeper. Creators narrate their experiences through a blend of hyperboles, frustration, and resilience, offering sophisticated peer-generated pedagogies alongside cautionary tales. Recommendations emphasise strategic resource curation, sustained practice, systematic memorisation, and a mindset of deliberate over-preparation. These portrayals of subject demands and agentic responses resonate with prior research on the cultural construction of physics as hard and exclusionary, while also illustrating how affinity spaces on social media enable students to reframe difficulty through shared feelings and tactics. We discuss the value of student-led online discourses about high-stakes examinations for educators in supporting prospective and current physics students.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The use of a simple digital weather station (not only) in teaching physics</a><span class="id">[2512.07513]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>One of key goals of contemporary physics (and, realistically, STEM) education is to develop students' science literacy and critical thinking skills. In this paper, we present the construction and use of several versions of a simple school-based digital weather station that students can use to measure fundamental physical quantities (temperature, pressure, air humidity, light intensity) as part of school activities. The weather stations were constructed at our workplace using an Arduino microcontroller, BBC micro: bit, and the school measurement system Coach. This paper proposes not only the design and related programming of the weather stations but also how students can collect, analyse, and interpret measured data, thereby learning scientific methods and developing science literacy and critical thinking. This hands-on approach also develops students' experimental skills, emphasizes the cross-curricular relationships between physics, computer science and geography, and teaches them to work with accurate data in the context of real environmental problems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A few ideas to promote inclusion</a><span class="id">[2512.06011]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Promoting diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) is both a legal and professional responsibility in French research institutions. This paper presents practical strategies to foster inclusive work environments within French research units. We summarize the regulatory context, key findings from the INSU-AA prospective on discrimination, and fundamental principles for promoting equity. We discuss approaches to mitigate implicit biases across all career stages, from early education to retirement, and outline strategies for equitable recruitment and career advancement. Concrete initiatives in one of our units (LESIA/LIRA) are described, including internal communications, exhibitions, and accessible pedagogical activities. The creation of a dedicated commission within the unit council ensures coordinated DEIA efforts, legitimized by institutional support and methodical planning. By sharing these experiences, we provide actionable guidance for research units seeking to advance DEIA in science.</p></div></details></article>
<h2>Popular Physics</h2><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20329" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Strategies for Observing Technosignatures on Terrestrial Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2511.20329]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The search for technosignatures–remotely detectable evidence of extraterrestrial technology–draws upon examples from the recent history of Earth as well as projections of Earth's technosphere. Facilities like the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will significantly advance the feasibility of characterizing the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets at visible and near-infrared wavelengths, while other future mission concepts could extend this search to mid-infrared wavelengths. We draw upon a recently developed set of 10 self-consistent scenarios for future Earth technospheres as analogs for extraterrestrial technospheres, which we use to outline a stepwise technosignature search strategy, beginning with HWO and followed by other missions. We find that HWO could reveal elevated abundances of a CO$_2$ + NO$_2$ pair on planets with combustion and other large-scale industry, which could be observable in up to eight of the 10 scenarios. Follow-up radio observations could reveal narrowband directed transmissions, as occur in two of the scenarios. Further study involving direct detections at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Large Interferometer for Exoplanets could reveal spectral features from industry, such as the combinations of CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 in four scenarios and CO$_2$ + CFC-11/12 + CF$_4$ in one scenario; two of these also include the N$_2$O + CH$_4$ + NH$_3$ triple from large-scale agriculture. Other mission concepts, such as a solar-gravitational-lens mission, could reveal large-scale surface features in two scenarios that would otherwise show no detectable technosignatures, while an interplanetary flyby or probe mission would be the most conclusive way to reveal the presence of technology on terrestrial exoplanets.</p></div></details></article></body>
