For planets orbiting rapidly rotating, and consequently oblate, host stars, photometric light curves provide a unique opportunity to measure the spin-orbit angle. Moreover, in systems with significant spin-orbit misalignment, the stellar oblateness can induce observable orbital precession. We wish to study the atmosphere and orbital architecture of an ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189 b, orbiting around a hot A-type star. We use the photometric phase curves and gravity-darkened transits of WASP-189 b observed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), complemented with the archival observations from CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS). We detected a phase curve signal with significant occultation depth of 203.4 (+16.2) (-16.3) ppm, while the nightside flux, -71.8 (+36.4) (-36.0) ppm, is consistent with zero at 2-sigma. We invert the phase curve signal to construct the temperature map of the planet. The map was subsequently used to estimate the Bond albedo and heat redistribution efficiency, the expected median ranges of which are found to be 0.19-0.35 and 0.09-0.41, respectively. Finally, we analysed gravity-darkened transits to find that the planet is in polar orbit with the spin-orbit angle of 89.46 (+1.08) (-1.08) deg. We found no hint of orbital precession while comparing our results with those from the literature. Our observations, together with atmospheric modelling, suggest that the dayside emission of WASP-189 b in TESS and CHEOPS bandpasses is dominated by thermal emission from an atmosphere with extremely inefficient heat transport and negligible contribution from reflected light.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 2.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05191" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $ρ$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU) I: A Planetary-Mass Companion and a Disk-Obscured Stellar Companion Discovered in Taurus</a><span class="id">[2512.05191]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present the first discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics imaging survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor (PyWFS). We have found two faint ($\Delta$K 7 mag), wide-separation companions to two  3-Myr-old Taurus members. Relative astrometry for these systems show that both companions are bound to their host stars. We obtained near-infrared spectra of these companions using IRTF/SpeX (R 100) and Gemini/GNIRS (R 1000-2000), and combine these with photometry from our NIRC2 imaging, the Pan-STARRS survey, and Spitzer/IRAC archival imaging to constrain their properties. One companion, KOINTREAU-1b (at a projected separation of 690 au), has an average near-IR spectral type of M9$\pm$2, a gravity classification of VL-G, and a changing spectral type between the SpeX (M7) and GNIRS (L1) observations. We estimate this object's mass to be $10.6^{+2.5}_{-2.3}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, making KOINTREAU-1b the fifth planetary-mass companion found in Taurus. The other companion, KOINTREAU-2b (projected separation 560 au), has a spectral type of M4.5$\pm$1 but is  4 magnitudes underluminous relative to other Taurus stars of the same spectral type. We detect exceptionally strong He I 1.083 micron emission from this object, indicative of outflows driven by ongoing accretion, but with a conspicuous lack of accompanying H emission. We conclude that KOINTREAU-2b is a young star obscured by an edge-on disk and observed in scattered light. Finally, we derive a distortion solution for NIRC2 imaging which shows a 0.118° difference in position angle from the previous distortion solution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05218" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Step Localization Method for Electromagnetic Followup of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Gravitational-Wave Triggers</a><span class="id">[2512.05218]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Rapid detection and follow-up of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to gravitational wave (GW) signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers are essential for constraining source properties and probing the physics of relativistic transients. Observational strategies for these early EM searches are therefore critical, yet current practice remains suboptimal, motivating improved, coordination-aware approaches. We propose and evaluate the Two-Step Localization strategy, a coordinated observational protocol in which one wide-field auxiliary telescope and one narrow-field main telescope monitor the evolving GW sky localization in real time. The auxiliary telescope, by virtue of its large field of view, has a higher probability of detecting early EM emission. Upon registering a candidate signal, it triggers the main telescope to slew to the inferred location for prompt, high-resolution follow-up. We assess the performance of Two-Step Localization using large-scale simulations that incorporate dynamic sky-map updates, realistic telescope parameters, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-weighted localization contours. For context, we compare Two-Step Localization to two benchmark strategies lacking coordination. Our results demonstrate that Two-Step Localization significantly reduces the median detection latency, highlighting the effectiveness of targeted cooperation in the early-time discovery of EM counterparts. Our results point to the most impactful next step: next-generation faster telescopes that deliver drastically higher slew rates and shorter scan times, reducing the number of required tiles; a deeper, truly wide-field auxiliary improves coverage more than simply adding more telescopes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05220" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Multiple outflows and delayed ejections revealed by early imaging of novae</a><span class="id">[2512.05220]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Novae are thermonuclear eruptions on accreting white dwarfs in interacting binaries. Although most of the accreted envelope is expelled, the mechanism – impulsive ejection, multiple outflows or prolonged winds, or a common-envelope interaction – remains uncertain. GeV $\gamma$-ray detections from $&gt;20$ Galactic novae establish these eruptions as nearby laboratories for shock physics and particle acceleration, underscoring the need to determine how novae eject their envelopes. Here we report on near-infrared interferometry, supported with multiwavelength observations, of two $\gamma$-ray detected novae. The images of the very fast 2021 nova V1674 Her, taken just 2–3 days after discovery, reveal the presence of two perpendicular outflows. The interaction between these outflows likely drives the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Conversely, the images of the very slow 2021 nova V1405 Cas suggest a delay in the ejection of the bulk of the accreted envelope of more than 50 days after the start of eruption, as the nova slowly rises to visible peak and during which the envelope engulfed the system in a common envelope phase. These unprecedented images offer direct observational evidence that the mechanisms driving mass ejection from the surfaces of accreting white dwarfs are not as simple as previously thought, revealing multiple outflows and delayed ejections.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05281" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Absorption of strong electromagnetic waves in magnetized pair plasmas</a><span class="id">[2512.05281]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We discuss synchrotron absorption of a short electromagnetic pulse that propagates in a cold magnetized pair plasma. We show that the pulse can be absorbed when $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0&lt; \omega&lt; a_0\omega_{\rm B}$, where $a_0&gt;1$ is the strength parameter of the pulse, and $\omega$ and $\omega_{\rm B}$ respectively are the frequency of the wave and the cyclotron frequency in the background magnetic field (all quantities are defined in the reference frame where the particles are at rest before being illuminated by the pulse). The condition $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0&lt; \omega&lt; a_0\omega_{\rm B}$ is essentially a generalization of the cyclotron resonance to strong electromagnetic pulses with $a_0&gt;1$. When $\omega_{\rm B}/a_0&lt; \omega&lt; a_0\omega_{\rm B}$, the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a plasma can be very different with respect to the propagation in vacuum because the wave equation is strongly non-linear. Then it is unclear whether the particles are heated stochastically due to synchrotron absorption, as found by studying the motion of a test particle in the field of a vacuum electromagnetic wave. We discuss implications of our results for constraining emission models of fast radio bursts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuclear parameter inference with semi-agnostic priors</a><span class="id">[2512.05315]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio pulsar timing, X-ray pulse profile modeling or gravitational-wave detections of binary mergers involving at least one neutron star offer the opportunity to elucidate the properties of dense and neutron rich matter in thermodynamic regimes inaccessible to nuclear laboratories. Such inference relies on building appropriate equation-of-state priors, such as the recently introduced semi-agnostic constructions that incorporate nuclear theory and experimental information available in low to intermediate density regimes, while offering the necessary flexibility at high density. In this paper, we assess how detections of mass, radius, and tidal deformability for low-mass ($\sim 1$M$_{\odot}$) or high-mass ($\sim 1.9$M$_{\odot}$) neutron stars would contribute to constraining nuclear empirical parameters in an inference based on semi-agnostic equation-of-state priors. We first assessed the correlation factors between nuclear empirical parameters and the zero-temperature and $\beta$-equilibrated pressure in different regimes of density. We then simulate observations for three nucleonic equations of state to test the recovery of the corresponding nuclear empirical parameters. We show that not all nuclear empirical parameters significantly correlate with the pressure and find a competition between them in the high-density regime that challenges their inference. We also find that using semi-agnostic constructions instead of assuming a nucleonic content up to the highest densities in the neutron-star core can help recover more accurately the true nuclear empirical parameters. Parameterizing the high-density regime of the equation of state with the nucleonic meta-model can pollute the inference of nuclear empirical parameters; semi-agnostic constructions are a solution to that. However, many nuclear matter empirical parameters contribute in a similar way to the building of baryonic pressure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Glow of Axion Quark Nugget Dark Matter: (IV) CMB Spectral and Anisotropy Signatures</a><span class="id">[2512.05401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Axion quark nuggets (AQNs) are macroscopic dark-matter candidates, with masses of the order of a few grams to a kilogram and sub-micron radius, thought to form at the Quantum Chromo Dynamic era through axion-induced charge separation. This framework naturally links the dark and visible matter abundances ($\Omega_{\rm DM} \sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$) and provides a mechanism for generating the baryon-antibaryon asymmetry where dark matter is composed of matter AQNs and antimatter AQNs. Although behaving as cold dark matter on cosmological scales, baryons annihilate with antimatter AQNs, producing ionizing high-energy photons. The resulting energy injection may imprint spectral distortions on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and modify the reionization history. Using a modified version of the \texttt{CLASS} Boltzmann code we compute the impact of this energy injection on the $\mu$ and $y$ spectral distortion parameters as well as on the optical depth. We find that (1) the CMB anisotropies remain essentially unaffected by baryon annihilation, and (2) the associated spectral distortion signatures lie within the sensitivity reach of proposed CMB spectral distortion missions. Finally, we discuss the similarities and differences between the AQN scenario and annihilating or decaying dark matter models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05435" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spinning Primordial Black Holes and Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves from Single Field Inflation</a><span class="id">[2512.05435]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs), their spin and abundance, in a single-field inflationary model based on a mutated hilltop potential inserted with a small step-like feature. This step induces a brief phase of ultra-slow-roll inflation, producing the large enhancement of the scalar power spectrum required for an appreciable amount of PBH abundance. Instead of the commonly used analytical power spectra, we compute the primordial power spectrum accurately by numerically solving the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation. Using the obtained power spectrum, we apply peak theory with $\nabla^2 \zeta$ treated as a Gaussian random field and parametrize the curvature profile by its amplitude $\mu$ and characteristic width $K$. Confining the study to Type-I PBH, the threshold value is calculated using two robust methods: the average of the compaction function and the q-function method. Using the result, the dimensionless spin parameter of the resulting PBHs is calculated at linear order and found to be $\sqrt{\langle a_\star^2 \rangle} \sim 10^{-3}$; however, it can be higher for smaller masses. We present detailed predictions for two representative parameter sets, calculate the present-day PBH mass function $f_{\rm PBH}(M)$ and the associated scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGW). The first produces PBHs of mass $M \simeq 10^{-13}\,M_\odot$ that can account for $100\%$ of dark matter, while the second yields $M \simeq 10^{-2}\,M_\odot$ PBHs contributing approximately $2.4\%$ of the dark matter density. The predicted signals of SIGWs lie within the sensitivity bands of future experiments such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, and SKA. In particular, the second parameter set produces a SIGWs compatible with the recent NANOGrav evidence for a low-frequency gravitational-wave signal.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Persistently Active Fast Radio Burst source Embedded in an Expanding Supernova Remnant</a><span class="id">[2512.05448]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast radio bursts (FRBs) remain one of the most puzzling astrophysical phenomena. While most FRBs are detected only once or sporadically, we present the identification of FRB 20190520B as the first persistently active source over a continuous span of   four years. This rare long-term activity enabled a detailed investigation of its dispersion measure (DM) evolution. We also report that FRB 20190520B exhibits a substantial decrease in DM at a global rate of minus 12.4 plus or minus 0.3 pc cm^-3 yr^-1, exceeding previous FRB DM variation measurements by a factor of three and surpassing those observed in pulsars by orders of magnitude. The magnitude and consistency of the DM evolution, along with a high host DM contribution, strongly indicate that the source resides in a dense, expanding ionized medium, likely a young supernova remnant (SNR).</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05493" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Search for UHE gamma photons in cosmic rays by studying the geomagnetic influence on air-shower muons</a><span class="id">[2512.05493]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>A major challenge in ground-based ultra-high-energy gamma-ray observations remains in discriminating sporadic gamma-ray signals from a huge background of cosmic-ray events. To achieve good discrimination power of gamma rays against protons, an unconventional approach is presented that exploits the geomagnetic influence on air shower muons in Monte Carlo shower events. A recognizable polar asymmetry in the positive and negative muon distributions is noticed after transforming the impact coordinates of each muon from the observer plane onto the shower front plane, plus a judicious ignoring of the minimal attenuation of muons in the space between the two planes. A couple of observables, $d_{\text{max}}$ and $N_{\mu; \text{IQS}}^{\text{tr.}}$, can be extracted from the formation of two densely populated positive and negative muon zones in each shower. Both observables demonstrate excellent gamma/proton discrimination power, with efficiencies of $93.2\%$ and $98.6\%$. This analysis permitted the usage of muon detectors just covering a small area of $\simeq{1.4}\%$ of a square-km array for ultra-high-energy gamma-ray observations. It is expected that the present and future gamma-ray observatories will implement the current approach.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05503" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Absorption in the 21 cm Hydrogen Line at $z&gt;10$ as a Sensitive Tool for the Construction of a Cosmological Model on Small Scales</a><span class="id">[2512.05503]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The cosmic microwave background absorption intensity in the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen in the presence of additional power in the form of a &quot;bump&quot; in the spectrum of cosmological density perturbations is calculated. The main absorption-amplifying effect is the earlier birth of the first stars forming an ultraviolet radiation background. This radiation reduces the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen and, thus, amplifies the absorption in the 21 cm line. A comparison of various cosmological models (with and without a bump in the density perturbation spectrum) shows that it is possible to determine the probable position of the bump in the perturbation spectrum and, thus, to reconstruct the spectrum of cosmological perturbations on scales $k&gt;1$ Mpc${}^{-1}$ from the position of the absorption frequency profile.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution of the Inner Accretion Flow in Swift J1727.8$-$1613 across Intermediate States: Insights from Broadband Spectral and Timing Analysis</a><span class="id">[2512.05544]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a comprehensive broadband spectral and variability study of the newly detected black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8–1613 in the intermediate states during its 2023 outburst, using multi-mission observations from NICER, NuSTAR, AstroSat, and Insight-HXMT. The spectral data up to $78$ keV in the hard-intermediate state (HIMS) requires models with two Comptonizing regions. In contrast, models with a single Comptonizing region adequately describe the soft-intermediate states (SIMS), implying a significant evolution in the disk-corona geometry between the states. The hard X-ray tail above $100$ keV in the HIMS, detected with both AstroSat/CZTI and Insight-HXMT/HE, indicates that the electron population in the corona is not purely thermal but rather hybrid, with a power-law distribution above the thermal cutoff. While both the reflection modeling and disk continuum fitting favor a truncated disk geometry in the HIMS, the disk substantially moves close to the innermost stable circular orbit in the SIMS, accompanied by a significant rise in the disk temperature. This interpretation is further supported by the increase in the QPO frequency from $\sim1.3$ to $\sim6.6$ Hz. From joint modeling of the disk continuum and reflection component, we estimate a black hole mass of $10.5^{+7.7}_{-3.0}$, spin of $0.79^{+0.03}_{-0.13}$, and disk inclination angle of $42^\circ$-$50^\circ$, which match well with the previously reported spectro-polarimetric measurements. The inferred source distance of $\sim3.5$ kpc is consistent with the recent estimate based on optical spectroscopy. We find a weakly variable or stable disk and a highly variable Comptonized component.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Dark Sector Equations of State Govern Interaction Signatures</a><span class="id">[2512.05548]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using late-Universe observations, we demonstrate that freeing dark energy and dark matter equations of state (EoS) dramatically alters the inferred strength and direction of their interactions. When dark sector EoS are fixed to $w_{\mathrm{de}}=-1$ and $w_{\mathrm{dm}}=0$, the data consistently favor an energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter across various interaction forms. This apparent evidence, however, proves highly sensitive to the EoS assumptions: treating $w_{\mathrm{de}}$ as a free parameter substantially weakens the evidence for interaction, with its value converging to the quintessence regime ($w_{\mathrm{de}}&gt;-1$). In contrast, freeing $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ maintains a preference for interaction, revealing a correlation where positive $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ is associated with energy transfer from dark energy to dark matter, and negative $w_{\mathrm{dm}}$ with energy transfer from dark matter to dark energy. These findings caution against the simplistic assumption of $\Lambda$CDM EoS values when attempting to detect a possible interaction. Despite these fundamental degeneracies, model comparison using the Akaike and Deviance information criteria shows that all of the tested interacting dark energy scenarios receive substantial support over the $\Lambda$CDM model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">14.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Growth rate measurements from a joint analysis of the large-scale galaxy clustering in Fourier and configuration space</a><span class="id">[2512.05581]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In this work, we test a framework to perform the analysis of redshift-space distortions simultaneously in configuration and Fourier space.

The 21-cm intensity field has a non-vanishing cross-correlation with the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect that traces the velocity and density perturbations of free electrons. By using the linear perturbation theory, in this paper we calculate analytically, for the first time, the cross-correlation between the squared kSZ field and the projection of the squared HI intensity mapping field with the flat-sky approximation. This statistic remains non-vanishing even after the long-wavelength line-of-sight modes ($k_{\parallel}$) are removed due to foreground contamination. We further forecast for the prospects of detection with the SKA-MID 21-cm intensity mapping experiments (redshifts in range of $0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1$), and the kSZ maps measured by Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and Simons Observatory (SO). The predicted cumulative signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is $1.92$ for SKA-ACT and $3.99$ for SKA-SO. These results show a possible on-the-edge detection on the cross-correlation signal at low redshifts, which in turn could serve as a validation step towards using it for the Epoch of Reionization studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05634" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CTAO LST-1 observations of magnetar SGR 1935+2154: Deep limits on sub-second bursts and persistent tera-electronvolt emission</a><span class="id">[2512.05634]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 has exhibited prolific high-energy (HE) bursting activity in recent years. Investigating its potential tera-electronvolt counterpart could provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of magnetar emission and very high-energy (VHE) processes in extreme astrophysical environments. We aim to search for a possible tera-electronvolt counterpart to both its persistent and sub-second-scale burst emission. We analysed over 25 h of observations from the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) during periods of HE activity from SGR 1935+2154 in 2021 and 2022 to search for persistent emission. For bursting emission, we selected and analysed nine 0.1 s time windows centred around known short X-ray bursts, targeting potential sub-second-scale tera-electronvolt counterparts in a low-photon-statistics regime. While no persistent or bursting emission was detected in our search, we establish upper limits for the tera-electronvolt emission of a short magnetar burst simultaneous to its soft gamma-ray flux. Specifically, for the brightest burst in our sample, the ratio between tera-electronvolt and X-ray flux is less than $10^{-3}$. The non-detection of either persistent or bursting tera-electronvolt emission from SGR 1935+2154 suggests that if such components exist, they may occur under specific conditions not covered by our observations. This aligns with theoretical predictions of VHE components in magnetar-powered fast radio bursts and the detection of MeV - GeV emission in giant magnetar flares. These findings underscore the potential of magnetars, fast radio bursts, and other fast transients as promising candidates for future observations in the low-photon-statistics regime with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes, particularly with the CTAO.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">17.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05737" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Radial modes of pressure bumps and dips in astrophysical discs</a><span class="id">[2512.05737]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This study investigates the signatures of pressure extrema on global oscillations in discs.

We highlight the influence of a previously unrecognized epicyclic-acoustic frequency and derive an analytical criterion for the existence of a branch of modes transiting between the inertial and the pressure bands. We find that pressure extrema consist of wave guides in which such topological modes propagate. The fundamental mode trapped at a pressure bump can propagate at all frequencies, allowing it to resonate with any temporal forcing, while the mode associated with a pressure gap propagates at a fixed frequency, propagates with arbitrary vertical phase velocity. These specific features make them attractive candidates for future discoseismology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">18.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05751" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exoplanet formation inference using conditional invertible neural networks</a><span class="id">[2512.05751]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The interpretation of the origin of observed exoplanets is usually done only qualitatively due to uncertainties of key parameters in planet formation models.

In addition to deterministic single planet formation runs, we also include gravitationally interacting planets in multiplanetary systems, which include some measure of chaos. For the latter case, we treat them as individual planets or choose the two or three planets most likely to be discovered by telescopes. We find that training on multiplanetary data, each planet treated as individual point, is promising. The single-planet data only covers a small range of planets and does not extrapolate well to planet properties not included in the training data. Extension to planetary systems will require more training data due to the higher dimensionality of the problem.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05816" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Most Rocky Sub-Neptunes are Molten: Mapping the Solidification Shoreline for Gas Dwarf Exoplanets</a><span class="id">[2512.05816]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Sub-Neptunes are the most common type of detected exoplanet, yet their observed masses and radii are degenerate with several interior structures. One possibility is that sub-Neptunes have silicate/iron interiors and H$_2$-dominated atmospheres, i.e., they are `gas dwarfs'. If gas dwarfs have molten interiors, interactions between their magma oceans and atmospheres will produce distinct observational signatures. These signatures may break the degeneracy in interior structure, while providing insight into their interior processes, history, and population trends. We expect all such planets are born molten, but under what conditions do they remain molten today? We use the coupled interior-climate evolution model, PROTEUS, to estimate the `solidification shoreline': the instellation flux boundary (as a function of stellar $T_{\rm eff}$) that separates molten gas dwarfs from solidified ones. Our results show that 98\% of detected sub-Neptunes occupy a region of parameter space consistent with their having permanent magma oceans, if they are gas dwarfs. While mantle $f{\rm O}_2$ and bulk volatile C/H ratio both influence magma ocean lifetimes, planets with oxidising mantles and carbon-rich atmospheres are unlikely to have radii consistent with the sub-Neptune classification. Therefore, most detected sub-Neptunes (if they are gas dwarfs) have permanent magma oceans. This result motivates further research into the interactions between molten interiors and overlying atmospheres, and campaigns to identify unambiguous signatures of these interactions.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05819" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraints on nDGP gravity from SPT galaxy clusters with DES and HST weak-lensing mass calibration and from Planck PR4 CMB anisotropies</a><span class="id">[2512.05819]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present constraints on the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati (nDGP) braneworld gravity model from the abundance of massive galaxy clusters. On scales below the nDGP crossover scale $r_{\rm c}$, the nDGP model features an effective gravity-like fifth force that alters the growth of structure, leading to an enhancement of the halo mass function (HMF) on cluster scales. The enhanced cluster abundance allows for constraints on the nDGP model using cluster samples. We employ the SPT cluster sample, selected through the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (tSZE) with the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and with mass calibration using weak-lensing data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The cluster sample contains 1,005 clusters with redshifts $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 1.78$, which are confirmed with the Multi-Component Matched Filter (MCMF) algorithm using optical and near-infrared data. Weak-lensing data from DES and HST enable a robust mass measurement of the cluster sample. We use DES Year 3 data for 688 clusters with redshifts $z &lt; 0.95$, and HST data for 39 clusters with redshifts $ 0.6 &lt; z &lt;1.7$. We account for the enhancement in the HMF through a semi-analytic correction factor to the $\nu\Lambda$CDM HMF derived from the spherical collapse model in the nDGP model. We then further calibrate this model using $N$-body simulations. In addition, for the first time, we analyze the primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements from Planck PR4 within the nDGP model. We obtain a competitive constraint from the joint analysis of the SPT cluster abundance with the Planck PR4 data, and report an upper bound of $1/\sqrt{H_0r_{\rm c}}&lt; 1.41$ at $95\%$ when assuming a cosmology with massive neutrinos.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05839" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hadronic Emissions from the Microquasar V4641 Sgr, SS433, and its implications in the Diffuse Galactic Emission</a><span class="id">[2512.05839]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Microquasars (MQs) are Galactic binary systems, consisting of a star and a compact object, a neutron star or a stellar mass black hole, which accretes matter from its companion star and gives rise to relativistic jets. Recent detection of very-high-energy (VHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{GeV}$) and ultra-high-energy (UHE; $E \gtrsim 100,\text{TeV}$) gamma-rays by LHAASO, HAWC and HESS from the MQ V4641 Sgr and SS 433 suggests them as Galactic PeVatrons. In this work, we studied a hadronic origin of the observed TeV-PeV gamma-ray emission from these MQs. We considered the hadronic scenario where the gamma-rays are produced by the interaction of relativistic protons in the MQ jet with the stellar wind. We fitted our model with observed data and constrained physical parameters like the hadronic jet power fraction, the proton spectral index, the maximum proton energy and the jet bulk Lorentz factor. Our best-fit model shows hard proton spectra ($1.84-2.44$) and maximum proton energies between 1 and 5 PeV. We also estimated the all-flavor neutrino fluxes corresponding to the gamma-ray fluxes from the hadronic model and found that V4641 sgr can be detected by next-generation neutrino telescopes like KM3NeT-ARCA and TRIDENT. Furthermore, we modeled a synthetic population of Galactic MQs and estimated their contribution to the diffuse TeV-PeV gamma-ray flux. For the inner Galaxy PSR contribution dominates in the range 10-100 TeV, and above 100 TeV diffused cosmic ray interactions with the molecular clouds is most dominant. We find that a population $\sim 14$ MQs is required to explain the LHAASO data above 100 TeV. For the outer Galaxy, we show that MQs are the dominant class of sources, and we constrain their population $\sim$14. Our findings strongly suggest that MQs are efficient particle accelerators, contributing to Galactic PeVatrons and potential multimessenger sources in our Galaxy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05847" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A redshift-independent theoretical halo mass function validated with the Uchuu simulations</a><span class="id">[2512.05847]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a new theoretical framework for the halo mass function (HMF) that accurately predicts the abundance of dark matter haloes across an exceptionally wide range in mass and redshift.

The GPS+ model naturally provides the correct normalization and high-mass behaviour without requiring empirical fitting. We calibrate and validate the GPS+ model using the Uchuu N-body simulation suite, which combines large cosmological volume and high mass resolution under Planck cosmology. Using six simulations with up to 300 realizations, we obtain precision HMF measurements spanning halo masses in the range 6.5 &lt; log($M_{\rm 200m}$/[h$^{-1}$ $M_{\odot}$]) &lt;16 over 0 &lt; z &lt; 20, with reduced cosmic variance. Across this full domain, the GPS+ model reproduces the simulated HMF with deviations typically below 10-20%. Comparison with the Sheth-Tormen (ST) model shows similar performance at z &lt; 2, but markedly improved agreement at higher redshifts, where ST can deviate by 70-80% while our model remains within  20%. Finally, we assess the impact of the halo mass definition: adopting the evolving virial overdensity of Bryan &amp; Norman (1998) worsens agreement at low redshift and high masses, whereas M200m yields a more universal, nearly redshift-independent HMF.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05860" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-contrast L-band Integral Field Spectroscopy of HD 33632 Ab</a><span class="id">[2512.05860]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present LBTI/ALES 3.07-4.08 micron spectroscopic observations of HD 33632 Ab, a  53 M_Jup directly imaged companion to an F8 star.

The data are compared to isolated brown dwarf template spectra, indicating that HD 33632 Ab is similar to L8/9 field brown dwarfs. Synthetic atmosphere model spectra from multiple model families are fit, with cloudy models providing the best fits, consistent with expectations for an L-dwarf. Evolutionary model predictions for the bulk properties of HD 33632 Ab are highly constrained by the precise dynamical mass found for the object. In particular, predictions for surface gravity are narrowly peaked, log(g)=5.21+/-0.05, and not dependent on the effects of clouds or cloud dispersion. We find significant tension between the surface gravities and object radii inferred from atmosphere model fits and those predicted by evolutionary models.

Their gravity-mode pulsation frequencies are sensitive to the near-core structure, which makes them useful probes of rotation and mixing in the deep stellar interior. Time series photometry, such as from the Kepler and TESS space telescopes, allows the extraction of their pulsation frequencies and construction of period spacing patterns. Previously, samples of slowly pulsating B stars were observed by the Kepler mission and underwent forward asteroseismic modelling to retrieve stellar parameters such as mass, age and core mass. However, all of these stars have since been re-observed by the ongoing TESS mission with light curves that are usually shorter and non-continuous, resulting in more difficult frequency extraction and interpretation in terms of constructing period spacing patterns. In this paper we compare the results of forward asteroseismic modelling of a sample of SPB stars using intermittent TESS light curve data to those based on long-duration Kepler light curves. We show how in some cases that the masses and core masses derived from only a few sectors of TESS data agree well with the 4-yr Kepler mission results, despite the stars having far fewer significant pulsation frequencies in their TESS light curves. However, some stars yield incompatible results, emphasising the complexities in forward asteroseismic modelling of gravity-mode pulsators with sparsely sampled or short duration TESS light curves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Differentially rotating neutron stars with dark matter cores</a><span class="id">[2512.05898]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Dark matter is expected to accumulate inside neutron stars, modifying the structure of isolated stars and influencing both the dynamics of binary mergers and the evolution of the resulting hypermassive remnants.

We extend previous results to cover cases of particular phenomenological interest where the scalar background oscillates sinusoidally but not necessarily slowly compared to the thermalization rates of the primordial bath.

The quasi–normal–mode frequencies encode the mass and spin of the Kerr black-hole remnant, while the mode excitation depends on the progenitor binary. In this paper, we implement a recently developed amplitude model that captures spin precession in a simulation-based inference pipeline that specifically targets ringdown signals. We present a critical re-analysis of GW190521 – a short-duration, merger-dominated event with conflicting interpretations. Spin-aligned and precessing analyses at two ringdown start times show that precession induces modest but systematic shifts in inferred parameters and subdominant mode amplitudes, although such ringdown-only analyses provide no strong evidence for precession. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of physics-informed precessing ringdown modelling, paving the way for the identification of spin precession in gravitational-wave events using solely their ringdown stages, where waveform systematics are expected to be substantially less prominent.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05380" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Illuminating sequential freeze-in dark matter with dark photon signal at the CERN SHiP experiment</a><span class="id">[2512.05380]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves observable footprints in dark matter direct detection, collider or fixed-target experiments, which can be altered in the two-field context.

Recent developments, however, have introduced complementary analytical strategies that merge theoretical modeling with advanced data driven methodologies. In particular, Bayesian inference, machine learning, and deep learning have emerged as powerful tools for constraining the EoS and extracting physical insight from complex observational datasets. In this work, we employ state of the art machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze mass radius relations of compact objects with the aim of reconstructing or inferring their underlying equations of state. The analysis is based on an extensive library of physically consistent, multimodal EoSs for neutron stars and a corresponding set for quark stars, each constructed to satisfy established theoretical and observational constraints. By leveraging the predictive capacity of these computational frameworks, we demonstrate the potential of data-driven approaches to provide refined insights into the behavior of matter at supranuclear densities and to contribute to a more unified understanding of the dense matter EoS.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Constraining r-process nucleosynthesis via enhanced accuracy neutron-capture experiments</a><span class="id">[2512.05944]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The isotopic abundances of r-process elements in the solar system are traditionally derived as residuals from the subtraction of s-process contributions from total solar abundances.

Building upon the seminal work of Goriely (1999), who introduced a multi-event s-process model to quantify these uncertainties, we revisit the problem using a simplified yet effective approach. By assuming that the relative uncertainty in s-process isotopic abundances scales linearly with the MACS uncertainties from data libraries (KADoNiS), we identify a subset of isotopes for which the r-process residuals remain significantly uncertain. Using updated solar abundances (Lodders 2025) and s-process contributions from Bisterzo et al.

Our analysis provides a practical framework for prioritizing future experimental efforts that will profit from upgrades and enhancements of the n_TOF facility.

The non-Gaussianities of $\zeta$ can be shown to arise from its non-linear relation to the inflaton fluctuations and from the intrinsic non-Gaussianities of the latter, which stem from its self interactions. We find that intrinsic non-Gaussianities, which have often been ignored to estimate the abundance of primordial black holes in this kind of scenario, are important.

Our results differ noticeably from those of the DESI Collaboration, in which they used the same DESI DR2 data combined with Planck data and found a 3.1$\sigma$ deviation from a cosmological constant, which is primarily the consequence of their assuming parametrization w_X(z)=w_0+w_a(1-a). Our results indicate that assuming a linear w_X(z) could be misleading and precludes discovering how dark energy actually varies with time at higher redshifts. In our quest to discover the physical nature of dark energy, the most urgent goal at present is to determine definitively whether dark energy density varies with time. It is of critical importance to measure dark energy density as a free function of redshift from data. Future galaxy redshift surveys by Euclid and Roman at higher redshifts will significantly advance our understanding of dark energy.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">35.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Kinetic Simulations of Monster Shocks and Their Emission</a><span class="id">[2506.04175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Fast magnetosonic waves are one of the two low-frequency plasma modes that can exist in a neutron star magnetosphere.

We use in-transit, highly precise radial velocity measurements with the Keck Planet Finder (KPF) to characterize the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect and measure the projected spin-orbit obliquity $|\lambda|=1.4\pm2.5^\circ$ and the full 3D spin-orbit obliquity of the brown dwarf to be $\psi=15.1^{+15.0^\circ}_{-10.9}$. This value of $\lambda$ implies that the brown dwarf's orbit is prograde and well-aligned with the equator of the host star, continuing the trend of transiting brown dwarfs showing a preference for alignment ($\lambda \approx 0^\circ$) regardless of the stellar effective temperature. We find that this contrast with the transiting giant planet population, whose spin-orbit alignments depend on host $T_{\rm eff}$, shows an increasingly clear distinction in the formation and orbital migration mechanisms between transiting giant planets and transiting brown dwarfs like CWW 89Ab.

Microquasars – compact jet-emitting sources – have emerged as possible PeV CR accelerators, especially after detections of ultrahigh-energy gamma rays from these systems. We propose that the observed proton spectrum (hard below a few PeV, steep beyond) arises from the reacceleration of sub-TeV Galactic CRs via shear acceleration in large-scale microquasar jet-cocoon structures. Our model also naturally explains the observed spectrum of energies around a few tens of PeV by summing up heavier nuclei contributions. Additionally, similar reacceleration processes in radio galaxies can contribute to ultrahigh-energy CRs, bridging Galactic and extragalactic origins. Combined with low-energy CRs from supernova remnants and galaxy clusters around the second knee region, this scenario could provide a unified explanation for CRs across the entire energy spectrum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08931" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmic Dipoles from Large-Scale Structure Surveys</a><span class="id">[2507.08931]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Large-scale structure surveys can be used to measure the dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), in the luminosity distances inferred from type-Ia supernova observations, and in the spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars. The measurements of these cosmic dipoles appear to be mutually inconsistent, even though they are expected to indicate the common observer velocity. This observational tension may represent a significant challenge to the standard model of cosmology. Here we study in detail what contributes to the cosmic dipoles from CMB, supernova, and galaxy survey in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, though our theoretical model can be applied beyond the standard model. While measurements of the cosmic dipoles yield the relative velocities between the source samples and the observer velocity, the motion of the observer is the dominant contribution in the conformal Newtonian gauge, and the intrinsic velocities of the samples fall steeply with increasing redshift of the sources. Hence the cosmic dipoles of CMB, type-Ia supernovae, and galaxies should be aligned but can have different amplitudes. We also clarify several misconceptions that are commonly found in the literature.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22812" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Biased Domain Walls and the Origin of Early Massive Structures</a><span class="id">[2507.22812]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Discrete symmetry-breaking phase transitions in the early universe may have caused the formation of networks of sheet-like topological defects, usually referred to as domain walls, which separate regions that have settled into different vacuum states. Field theory simulations predict the successive collapse of increasingly larger domains, which could potentially leave observable imprints in present-day large-scale structures. We use a non-parametric analytical model to provide an estimate of the final decay energy of these walls and their associated collapse rate, as a function of redshift. The energy released by collapsing walls can act as a seed for density perturbations in the background matter field, influencing structure formation. We estimate the dependence of the current mass of the resulting non-linear objects on the collapse redshift and wall tension, showing that domain walls can contribute to the formation of objects as massive as present-day galaxy clusters. Still, we confirm that the contribution of standard domain walls to structure formation is subdominant. In contrast, biased domain walls - originating in models with an approximate (or biased) discrete symmetry breaking - generally face much less stringent constraints on their tension, which allows for significantly higher collapse energies. Based on our analysis, we are able to show that the collapse of such biased wall networks can provide a significant contribution to structure formation, and, in particular, a mass excess at $z \gtrsim 7$ as suggested by JWST data.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20125" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation</a><span class="id">[2509.20125]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In recent years, many wide orbit circumbinary giant planets have been discovered; some of these may have formed by gravitational fragmentation of circumbinary discs. The aim of this work is to investigate the lower mass limit for circumbinary disc fragmentation. We use the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, which employs an approximate method for the radiative transfer, to perform 3 sets of simulations of gravitationally unstable discs. The first set of simulations covers circumstellar discs heated by a single 0.7M$_{\odot}$ star (circumstellar model), the second set covers binaries with the same total stellar mass as the circumstellar model, attended by circumbinary discs with the same temperature profile (circumbinary fiducial model), and the third set covers circumbinary discs heated by each individual star (circumbinary realistic model). We vary the binary separation, mass ratio and eccentricity to see their effect on disc fragmentation. For the circumstellar disc model, we find a lower disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation of $\sim\,$0.31. For the circumbinary fiducial disc model we find the same disc-to-star mass ratio for fragmentation (but slightly lower for more eccentric, equal-mass binaries; 0.26). On the other hand, realistic circumbinary discs fragment at a lower mass limit (disc-to-star mass ratio of 0.17-0.26), depending on the binary properties. We conclude that circumbinary discs fragment at a lower disc mass (by $\sim 45\%$) than circumstellar discs. Therefore, gas giant planet around binaries may be able to form by gravitational instability easier than around single stars.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02061" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strong-lensing rates of massive black hole binaries in LISA</a><span class="id">[2510.02061]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Similarly to electromagnetic (EM) signals, gravitational lensing by intervening galaxies can also affect gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we estimate the strong-lensing rate of massive black hole mergers observed with LISA. Given the uncertainties in the source populations as well as in the population of galaxies at high redshift, we consider: six different source population models, including light and heavy seeds, as well as three lens population models, including redshift-independent and redshift-dependent evolution properties. Among all the scenarios explored, the expected number of strong lensed events detected in a 4-year observation time in LISA ranges between 0.13-231 with most of them having two (one) images detectable in the heavy (light) seed scenarios. The event numbers obtained correspond to 0.2%-0.9% of all detected unlensed events. Out of all the detectable strong-lensed events, up to 61% (in the light-seed scenario) and 1% (in the heavy-seed scenario) of them are above the detectability threshold solely due to strong lensing effects and would otherwise be undetectable. For detectable pairs of strong-lensed events by galaxy lenses, we also find between 72%-81% of them to have time delays from 1 week to 1 year.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The demographics of core-collapse supernovae.

In massive binary systems, mass-transfer alters the pre-SN structures compared to single stars, leading to a diversity in SN explosions. Aims. We compute the distribution of CC-SN properties based on comprehensive detailed grids of single and binary stellar evolution models. We conduct a grid-based population synthesis to produce a synthetic population of CC-SNe, and compare it to observed SN samples. We also apply various explodability and merger criteria to our models. In line with earlier results, we identify interacting SN progenitors as those stars that undergo CC during or shortly after a Roche-lobe overflow phase. With an interacting binary fraction of 68%, our models predict two-thirds of all CC-SNe to be of Type IIP/L, and one third of Type Ibc, in agreement with recent volume-limited SN surveys. We find that 76% of the Type Ibc SN progenitors took part in a previous binary mass transfer (mostly as mass donor), but also 63% of the Type IIP/L SN progenitors (mostly as mass gainers), yielding a much broader envelope mass distribution than expected from single stars. We find that mass-transfer induced interacting SNe make up  5% of all CC-SNe, which is close to the observed fractions of Type IIn and Type Ibn SNe. When assuming a disk or toroidal CSM geometry for Type IIn SNe, our models predict a bimodal distribution of the radiated energies, similar to that deduced from observations. While we find the effect of binary evolution on the relative number of Type Ibc and Type IIP/L SNe to be moderate, it leads to lower average ejecta masses in Type Ibc and Type IIb SNe, and can lead to higher pre-SN masses in Type IIP/L SNe than single stars. Binary models are also able to reproduce the number and properties of interacting SNe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">43.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14464" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Built-in precision: Improving cluster cosmology through the self-calibration of a galaxy cluster sample</a><span class="id">[2510.14464]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We examine the potential improvements in constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ and matter density $\Omega_M$ from using clustering information along with number counts for future samples of thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich selected galaxy clusters. We quantify the relative improvement from including the clustering power spectrum information for three cluster sample sizes from 33,000 to 140,000 clusters and for three assumed priors on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relation. As expected, clustering information has the largest impact when (i) there are more clusters and (ii) the mass-observable priors are weaker. For current knowledge of the cluster mass-observable relationship, we find the addition of clustering information reduces the uncertainty on the dark energy equation of state, $\sigma(w)$, by factors of $1.023\pm 0.007$ to $1.0790\pm 0.011$, with larger improvements observed with more clusters. Clustering information is more important for the matter density, with $\sigma(\Omega_M)$ reduced by factors of $1.068 \pm 007$ to $1.145 \pm 0.012$. The improvement in $w$ constraints from adding clustering information largely vanishes after tightening priors on the mass-observable relationship by a factor of two. For weaker priors, we find clustering information improves the determination of the cluster mass slope and redshift evolution by factors of $1.389 \pm 0.041$ and $1.340 \pm 0.039$ respectively. These findings highlight that, with the anticipated surge in cluster detections from next generation surveys, self-calibration through clustering information will provide an independent cross-check on the mass slope and redshift evolution of the mass-observable relationship as well as enhancing the precision achievable from cluster cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25636" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mode Composition Shapes Magnetic Anisotropy in Solar Wind Turbulence</a><span class="id">[2510.25636]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Turbulence is a ubiquitous process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales, thereby influencing particle transport and heating. Recent progress has improved our understanding of the anisotropy of turbulence with respect to the mean magnetic field; however, its exact form and implications for magnetic topology and energy transfer remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the nature of magnetic anisotropy in compressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence within low-$\beta$ solar wind using measurements from the Cluster spacecraft. By decomposing small-amplitude fluctuations into Alfvén and compressible modes, we reveal that magnetic anisotropy is largely mode dependent: Alfvenic fluctuations are broadly distributed in propagation angle, whereas compressible fluctuations are concentrated near the quasi-parallel (slab) direction, a feature closely linked to collisionless damping of compressible modes. For $\beta\rightarrow0$, compressible modes become dominant within the slab component at smaller scales. These findings advance our understanding of magnetic anisotropy in solar wind turbulence and offer a new perspective on the three-dimensional turbulence cascade, with broad implications for particle transport, acceleration, and magnetic reconnection.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08481" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stellar cycle variability in Mount Wilson stars and dynamo models: Rotation rate and dynamo number dependency</a><span class="id">[2511.08481]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Similar to the solar cycle, the magnetic cycles of other solar-type stars are also variable. How the variability of the stellar cycle changes with the rotation rate or the dynamo number is a valuable information for understanding the stellar dynamo process. We examine the variability in the stellar magnetic cycles by studying 81 stars from the data of the Mount Wilson Observatory, which started observations in 1966. For 28 stars, we have time series data available till 2003, while for others, the data are limited till 1995. We specifically explore how the variability changes with respect to three rotation-related parameters. We find a modest positive correlation between the variability and the stellar rotation period. In addition, we find suggestive negative correlations between the variability and the inverse squared Rossby number ($Ro^{-2}$), and the ratio of the mean cycle duration and rotation period ($\log \, (\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle / P_{\rm rot})^2$). Variability computed from the magnetic field of stellar dynamo models also show similar trends. Finally, inspired by previous studies, we examine dynamo number scaling in our model data and find that $Ro^{-0.6}$ (instead of $Ro^{-2}$ as suggested in the linear $\alpha \Omega$ dynamo theory) and $(\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle /P_{\rm rot})^{0.6}$ (instead of $\log \, (\langle P_{\rm cyc} \rangle / P_{\rm rot})^2$ as predicted in previous observations) are a good measure of the dynamo number. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the stellar magnetic cycle variability decreases with the increase of the rotation rate or the dynamo number.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">46.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DESI-Like Hubble Expansion From Staged Symmetry Breaking</a><span class="id">[2511.15851]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release shows a moderate preference for dark energy with a time-varying equation of state parameter, suggesting that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model may need to be revised. In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a realization of that idea which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $\Lambda$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interferometric view into RT Pav's long secondary period. binary vs oscillatory convective modes</a><span class="id">[2511.21987]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Long secondary periods (LSPs) occur in about one-third of evolved stars, yet their origin remains unclear. The leading explanations are oscillatory convective modes and a binary companion embedded in dust. We investigate the LSP of the red giant RT Pav using multi-wavelength VLTI interferometry (PIONIER, GRAVITY, MATISSE; 1.5-5.0 microns), obtained near the phase where a companion would appear most separated. These data, combined with photometry and Gaia DR3 astrometry, constrain possible companion masses, orbits, and photometric effects. We model the interferometric observables using uniform-disk, limb-darkened, ellipse, binary, and oscillatory convective dipole representations, supported by Monte Carlo simulations. Gaia limits any companion to a mass whose Roche-lobe volume is too small to hold the obscuring or scattering material required to reproduce the observed LSP modulation. While binary fits can yield low chi-squared values, the inferred positions are inconsistent across wavelength, closure phases do not increase with wavelength as dusty companions predict, and significant detections occur in only two of four bands. Theoretical estimates show that a roughly 1 percent flux companion at LSP-like separations should be consistently detectable for typical O-rich AGB dust, but is not consistently observed. In contrast, an oscillatory convective dipole with a temperature contrast of about 200 K reproduces the H-band morphology and visible-light amplitude without violating Gaia or photometric constraints, and binary-like residuals vanish when dipole models are fitted. Our results therefore favor oscillatory convective modes over a binary origin for the LSP in RT Pav. Time-resolved spectro-interferometry across the LSP cycle is a natural next step.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">48.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08114" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black-hole evaporation for cosmological observers</a><span class="id">[2411.08114]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This work investigates the evaporation of black holes immersed in a de Sitter environment, using the Vaidya-de Sitter spacetime.

In patches where the Higgs mass parameter takes a natural value, the Higgs potential only admits a minimum with a large and negative energy density. This causes a cosmological crunch, removing such patches from the landscape. Conversely, in patches where the Higgs mass parameter is smaller than a critical value, the Higgs potential admits a metastable minimum with the standard cosmological history. This critical value is determined by the instability scale, where the quartic coupling turns negative due to its running. The ability of this mechanism to explain the observed Higgs mass hinges on new physics at the TeV scale, such as vector-like fermions. We study two simple realizations of this scenario in a heavy neutral lepton model and in the singlet-doublet model, the latter mimicking a Higgsino-bino system.

The deformed relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov theory in continuum (DRHBc) is capable of providing proper descriptions for exotic nuclei by simultaneously including deformation, pairing correlation and continuum effects, and a mass table of even-$Z$ nuclei with $8 \leqslant Z \leqslant 120$ has been developed based on the DRHBc theory. This work employs a methodology to estimate the masses of odd nuclei using neighboring even nuclei's masses and microscopic pairing gaps, and the performance of microscopic pairing gaps are validated by comparing with empirical ones. Combining the DRHBc masses of even-$Z$ nuclei and the estimated masses of odd-$Z$ nuclei, a pseudo DRHBc mass table is developed, with the root-mean-square (rms) deviation from available mass data $\sigma=1.47$ MeV. Then this mass table is employed in the $r$-process simulation; results show that the differences in the details of pairing gaps do not yield qualitative discrepancy in $r$-process abundances, while the deformation effects can influence the $r$-process path and thus affect the $r$-process abundance. In particular, the nuclear shape transitions can even lead to the discontinuity of the $r$-process path, suggesting that incorporating triaxiality or beyond-mean-field effects would be valuable for further improvement.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Null energy condition violation and beyond Horndeski physics in light of DESI DR2 data</a><span class="id">[2503.22515]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Inflation and dark energy (DE), both featuring accelerated expansion, are crucial components of modern cosmology.

Specific to observed non-equilibrium plasmas are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, most often described by Kappa (power-law) distributions. In this paper, we introduce an alternative modeling for linear waves in plasmas described by the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution model. This model can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons in interplanetary shocks and the solar transition region. The wave dispersion relation of longitudinal waves is derived in terms of the newly introduced Druyvesteyn dispersion function. The dispersion curves as well as damping rates of high-frequency Langmuir waves are numerically computed for the isotropic case, and their analytical approximations are provided in the limit of weak damping.
