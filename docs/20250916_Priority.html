Forming  10^9 Msun SMBHs by z   6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model (Sassano et al. 2021) by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli et al. 2007; Lousto et al. 2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Pop III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by  20-30% by z = 6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (&quot;wandering&quot;) BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets  0.1 arcsec and line-of-sight velocity shifts  10^2-10^3 km/s in a few percent of high-z quasars.

Recently, 181 candidate SMBH binaries were identified in Gaia DR3 based on periodicity in their $\sim$1000-day light curves. By supplementing Gaia photometry with longer-baseline light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Catalina Real Time Transient Survey (CRTS), we test whether the reported periodic signals persist beyond the Gaia DR3 time window. We find that in all 116 cases with available ZTF data, the Gaia-inferred periodic model fails to predict subsequent variability, which appears stochastic rather than periodic. The periodic candidates thus overwhelmingly appear to be false positives; red noise contamination appears to be the primary source of false detections. We conclude that truly periodic AGN are exceedingly rare, with at most a few in $10^6$ AGN exhibiting stable periodicity on 100 to 1000 day timescales. Models predict that the Gaia AGN light curve sample should contain dozens of true SMBH binaries with periods within the observational baseline, so the lack of strictly periodic light curves in the sample suggests that most short-period binary AGN do not have light curves dominated by simple periodicity.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 3.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assembling GW231123 in star clusters through the combination of stellar binary evolution and hierarchical mergers</a><span class="id">[2509.10609]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>GW231123 is the most massive binary black hole (BBH) merger detected to date by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. With at least one black hole (BH) in the upper-mass gap and both BHs exhibiting high spins ($\chi_{1,2} \gtrsim 0.8$), this event challenges standard isolated binary evolution models. A compelling alternative is a dynamical origin in star clusters, where stellar binaries and hierarchical mergers may both contribute to the formation of similar BBHs. In this work, we investigate the formation of GW231123-like events in different cluster environments using the B-POP semi-analytic population synthesis code. We find that low-metallicity environments ($Z \lesssim 0.002$) are ideal for producing BBH mergers similar to GW231123. In young and globular clusters, these BBHs have components formed in stellar binaries, whilst in nuclear clusters there is also a significant contribution from BHs built-up via hierarchical mergers. Natal spins of BHs formed in stellar binaries are crucial to find GW231123 analogs. In particular, our models suggest that BHs from stellar binaries are likely characterized by high-spins. Simulated GW231123-like systems exhibit short delay times, $t_\mathrm{del} \sim 0.1 - 1$ Gyr, which suggests their progenitors formed close to the inferred merger redshift ($z = 0.39^{+0.27}_{-0.24}$). We argue that star clusters in metal-poor dwarf galaxies or Milky Way-like galaxies are ideal nurseries, inferring an upper limit to the local merger rate of $\mathcal{R} \sim 1.6\times10^{-3} - 0.16$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for nuclear clusters, $\sim 0.036 - 0.72$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for globular clusters, and $4\times10^{-4}-0.041$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for young clusters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 4.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10612" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GLACE survey: OSIRIS/GTC multi-object spectroscopy of the rich galaxy cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 at z 0.4. III. The mass-SFR relation and the quenching of cluster galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.10612]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy clusters are among the largest and densest structures in the Universe. Their high density generally increases the suppression of star formation, known as quenching, altering galaxy properties. We study the quenching of emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the rich cluster ZwCl 0024.0+1652 (Cl0024) at redshift $z\sim0.4$, aiming to determine if and how star formation is suppressed. Using multi-object spectroscopy from the GLACE survey, we extracted fluxes and redshifts of [O II]$\lambda\lambda3727,3729$, $\mathrm{H\beta}$, and [O III]$\lambda5007$ emission lines to derive star formation rates (SFRs) for 173 ELGs. We also performed spectral energy distribution fitting to obtain key evolutionary parameters such as stellar masses ($M_\star$) and the 4000 Å break ($D4000$) index. We derived the $M_\star-\mathrm{SFR}$ relation for 98 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), finding 34.7% exhibit suppressed SFRs in the cluster, compared to 11.0% in the field. While the SFRs show no significant variation with local density, the fraction of SFGs is 1.55 times higher in the cluster outskirts than in intermediate-density regions. The specific SFR decreases strongly with $D4000$ for active SFGs but remains constant for suppressed galaxies. The fraction of suppressed galaxies in the infall region is 2.6 times higher than in the core, especially in the infalling structure B of the cluster. The cluster's total mass does not appear to be a key factor in SFG quenching. Star formation in Cl0024 galaxies is suppressed by the dense cluster environment. This suppression is evident in SFG fractions and parameters tracing long-term evolution, indicating prolonged quenching. The SFGs preferentially reside in low-density regions, while suppressed galaxies dominate the infall region, supporting a 'delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 5.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10615" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Discovery of a Large Active Wind from the Milky Way's Central Black Hole</a><span class="id">[2509.10615]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Every large galaxy has a black hole in its center. The interaction between the black hole and their host profoundly shapes galactic evolution and the Universe as a whole. The key feature of this interaction are black hole jets - or more generally winds - which every black hole must have. Despite our Galaxy's central black hole, Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), proximity and importance, the active wind from it has eluded scientists for over half a century. Here we report the discovery of a large active wind from Sgr A* using unprecedentedly deep observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). We detect a large conical clearing in the cold molecular gas surrounding Sgr A* that is at least 1 parsec in length and has a 45-degree opening angle. The morphology and energetics of this structure are consistent with active clearing by a hot wind from Sgr A*. This finding resolves the long-standing mystery of the missing wind from Sgr A*, and delivers the most detailed look yet of black hole feeding and feedback processes in our Galactic center.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 6.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10621" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Central-star extinctions towards planetary nebulae</a><span class="id">[2509.10621]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Planetary nebulae trace the hottest and most luminous phase of evolution of solar-type stars. We use these hot, bright stars to investigate extinctions towards a complete sample of 262 confirmed PNe with large angular diameters, which have the most reliable photometry and hottest central stars. For 162 of these PNe, we identify central stars, produce spectral energy distributions from survey data using PySSED, then fit reddened model spectra to the observed photometry to obtain extinctions accurate down to $E(B-V)$ of $\pm 0.02$ mag. The fitting is performed by Nelder-Mead $\chi^2$ minimisation, with uncertainties evaluated through MCMC. The catalogue of stellar temperatures is updated for our sample for the calculation of luminosities. The extinctions agree well with interstellar extinction. We find evidence of circumnebular extinction for one PN, and evaluate its effect on the planetary nebulae luminosity function. Four new close binaries are identified from the spectral energy distributions. The binary fraction in the full sample is between 23% and 36%. We use our compiled data to evaluate the quality of the central star identifications in the literature. Three objects in our sample have previously been classified as post-RGB systems but we find that their parameters may also be consistent with post-AGB evolution.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 7.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10654" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterizing the interplay between Galactic star formation and ionization feedback with PRIMA</a><span class="id">[2509.10654]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope show that nearby spiral galaxies are dominated by the presence of H I and H II bubbles that strongly shape their surrounding medium. These bubbles result from the feedback of high-mass stars at different stages of their life cycle. However, early (pre-supernova) feedback from high-mass stars is still poorly quantified. Recent results from numerical simulations suggest that the impact of high-mass star early feedback (photoionization, wind) on star formation properties is complex, time-dependent, and strongly depends on physical conditions, including the magnetic field properties. In our Galaxy, ionized (H II) regions observed in different evolution stages show a high diversity of star formation in their associated photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). However, the way in which the low- to high-density interstellar medium evolves to this situation remains elusive. Quantifying the impact of early feedback from high-mass stars on star formation properties and star formation laws (star formation rate, star formation efficiency versus gas surface density, {\Sigma}gas) will allow for a better understanding of the evolution of star formation laws in external galaxies, the laws that are key ingredients of galaxy evolution models. PRIMA, with its high sensitivity, large mapping efficiency, and polarimetric capabilities, offers a unique opportunity to address the way radiative feedback and magnetic field control star formation in the Milky Way.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 8.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10665" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM): Revealing the Structure of the Rosette Nebula</a><span class="id">[2509.10665]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Rosette Nebula is a well-known H II region shaped by the interaction of gas with the OB stars of the NGC 2244 stellar association. Located within the remnant of a giant molecular cloud, it exhibits a complex structure of ionized gas, molecular material, dust, and embedded clusters. In October 2023, the region was observed as part of the SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper (LVM) integral field spectroscopy survey. Covering a radius of approximately 1 degree, the dataset comprises 33,326 spectra with spatially resolved information spanning 390 - 980 nm. We present a structural analysis of the ionized, molecular, and dusty components using multi-wavelength observations: optical spectroscopy from SDSS-V LVM, 12CO emission from PMO/MWISP (sub-millimeter), and dust emission from WISE (12 micron) and Herschel (far-infrared). These datasets were complemented with the positions of ionizing stars to study emission structures traced by H alpha, H beta, [O III], [N II], and [S II], as well as the spatial distribution of line ratios (H alpha/H beta, [O III]/H beta, [N II]/H alpha, and [S II]/H alpha) relative to the surrounding molecular cloud. Our analysis reveals interaction zones between ionized and neutral gas, including filaments, globules, and dense regions with or without ongoing star formation. Radial and quadrant-based flux profiles further highlight morphological and ionization variations, supporting the scenario in which the Rosette Nebula evolved from a non-homogeneous molecular cloud with a thin, sheet-like structure.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num"> 9.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10670" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Formation of Cosmic Noon Protogalaxies via Quasar-Induced Fragmentation of a Cosmic Filament</a><span class="id">[2509.10670]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When black hole jets encounter ambient medium, they can compress the gas, trigger star formation, and create stellar clusters containing tens of thousands of stars. Here, we report a remarkable discovery of such a phenomenon that happened just 2.2 billion years after the Big Bang, during the Cosmic Noon era. Quasar SDSSJ141924.44+532315.5, powered by a one-billion-solar-mass black hole, is seen blasting a powerful jet that interacts with a hypermassive gas reservoir, creating a fascinating, clumpy, arc- like structure spanning over 250 kiloparsecs in projected length, consisting of at least eight clumps. Each clump contains billions of stars, is as massive as the Milky Way, and exhibits extreme levels of star formation. We interpret these findings as fragmentation of a cosmic filament triggered by a jet overpressurized expanding cocoon, which leads to the birth of protogalaxies, a process observed at scales never seen before. We find that the physical conditions within the filament are favorable for a fragmentation scenario to occur. We also discuss the survivability and evolution of individual clumps in the context of unsolved galaxy formation theory problems.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">10.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10674" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using white dwarf lensing to resolve accretion flows</a><span class="id">[2509.10674]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Microlensing is one of the most powerful tools for probing the nature of dark halo objects and the sources they lens. As our nearest massive galaxy, M31 provides a rich source population with many potential lenses in its halo crossing our field of view at any one time. In this paper we explore the probability that X-ray sources in M31 will be lensed by white dwarfs in M31's halo. We find an expected lensing rate of 2.6/year within the mean archival Swift XRT field-of-view, and 6.3/year for the whole galaxy. For X-ray emitting sources harboring accreting neutron stars and black holes, we find that microlensing offers a unique opportunity to constrain the properties of the inner accretion flow. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to recover both the spin of the black hole and the temperature profile of the accretion disk by discerning their effects upon the profile of the microlensing magnification. We show that these parameters have a significant effect on the shape of the light curve, with the effect of spin being more pronounced at smaller impact parameters and higher energies, while the effect of the temperature profile is larger at lower energies and larger impact parameters. This suggests that multi-band observations of a single lensing event could be used to robustly constrain both parameters.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">11.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10832" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orbit-based structural decomposition and stellar population recovery for edge-on barred galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.10832]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>In our previous paper, we developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies, and constructed dynamical models based on different mock observations of three galaxies from the Auriga simulations. In this study, we adopt 12 cases with side-on bars (three simulated galaxies, each with four different projections). We decompose these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits, and compare the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin disks, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and disks are well constrained with absolute biases $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.15$. The mass fractions of halos are recovered with $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 of 12 cases have $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.05$, while the other two cases have $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.10$. Then, by tagging the stellar orbits with ages and metallicities, we derive the chemical properties of each structure. For stellar ages, our models recover the negative gradients in the bars and disks, but exhibit relatively larger uncertainties for age gradients in the bulges and halos. The mean stellar ages of all components are constrained with absolute biases $|t_{\rm model}-t_{\rm true}|\rm\lesssim1\,Gyr$. For stellar metallicities, our models reproduce the steep negative gradients of the bars and bulges, and all different kinds of metallicity gradients in the disks and halos. Except for the bulge in the simulated galaxy Au-18, the mean stellar metallicities of all other components are constrained with absolute biases $|Z_{\rm model}-Z_{\rm true}|\rm\le0.5\,Z_{\odot}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">12.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10856" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evidence of Galactic Center Expansion from Gaia DR3 Stars along the South North Axis: Implications for the JWST Early Galaxy Problem</a><span class="id">[2509.10856]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have revealed massive, evolved galaxies only a few hundred million years after the Big Bang, challenging standard cosmological models. To test the hypothesis that the Galactic nucleus may act as a source of matter and energy capable of accelerating galaxy formation, we examined whether the Milky Way itself shows signs of central activity. Expansion of the Galactic center would imply such activity in its nuclear region. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed stellar motions along the south north axis of the Galaxy using Gaia DR3 data. Average Galactocentric radial velocities were computed in 50 control points, spaced by 0.1 kpc with a sampling radius of 0.05 kpc, up to 5 kpc from the Galactic center. The results show a strong symmetry: in the northern region, 36 of 50 points have positive velocities, with an average of 19.15 +/- 10.80 km/s (N = 50), while in the southern region, 37 of 50 points have negative velocities, with an average of - 19.24 +/- 8.22 km/s (N = 50). A Students t test confirms that the two distributions differ significantly (0.003). The combination of positive average velocities in the north and negative average velocities in the south indicates a symmetric outflow of stars away from the Galactic center, consistent with expansion in its central region. These Galactocentric radial velocities are consistent with the formation of massive, evolved galaxies within 300 My, as observed by JWST. If extended to other galaxies, the results (together with earlier findings on globular cluster motions) suggest that aspects of standard galaxy formation models may require refinement. This interpretation, however, remains preliminary and requires further study.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">13.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10883" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Space Astrometry with Gaia: Advances in Understanding our Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2509.10883]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Gaia is a satellite mission of the European Space Agency which is creating a catalogue of extremely accurate positions, distances and space motions of two billion stars in our Galaxy, along with more than one hundred thousand solar system asteroids, and several million distant quasars, all on the same extragalactic reference system.

Although single-epoch observations are more practical and require significantly less observational effort, they inherently introduce greater photometric scatter, leading to an increased dispersion in the derived Period-Luminosity relations. In this paper, we explore, in detail, a method that transforms single random-phase data to their mean-light values, using information obtained in other bands for the same Cepheid. This approach enables the accurate re-construction of mean-light PL relations for wavelengths observed with space-based facilities, for instance, where the number of epochs per star makes simple averaging or template fitting less than optimal, with the latter requiring very high-precision periods for predictive phasing. While applying this technique across multiple bands, from optical to mid-IR, we focus particularly on widely separated bands covering the mid-IR to the optical. We showcase this method using the J band (as being observed by JWST) as the random-phase component. Our results show that this correction reduces the scatter of the PL relation in the J band by a factor of approximately $0.7\times$, equivalent to increasing the number of random-phase observations by a factor of 10, needed to obtain the same increase in precision as delivered here.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">15.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11042" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST/NIRCam imaging of the Bipolar Planetary Nebula NGC 6537: the (Infra)red Spider, Revealed</a><span class="id">[2509.11042]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) near-infrared (NIRCam) Br$\alpha$, H$_2$, [Fe II], and PAH imaging of the molecule-rich, high-excitation bipolar planetary nebula (PN) NGC 6537 (the Red Spider), complemented by new ALMA and Chandra observations and archival HST images. The resulting multiwavelength view of the Red Spider establishes the detailed lobe/torus structure of the nebula and the mass-loss history of its progenitor star. The extinction-penetrating JWST/NIRCam Br$\alpha$ and PAH and ALMA 3 mm continuum imaging exposes the complexity of the ionized inner nebula. JWST/NIRCam H$_2$ imaging traces the full, $\sim$1.1 pc extent of the bubble-like lobes formed by fast ($\sim$300-400 km s$^{-1}$) polar outflows, while ALMA $^{13}$CO(1-0) mapping reveals a point-symmetric, slowly ($\sim$10 km s$^{-1}$) expanding equatorial torus of radius $\sim$0.13 pc. In striking contrast, the [Fe II] image displays an extended S-shaped emission morphology that traces collisions between an active, collimated wind and slower-moving material along the lobe rims. No X-rays are detected from the nebula or its central star in deep Chandra/HRC-I imaging. However, the combined HST and JWST imaging reveals a near-IR excess at the central star indicative of emission from hot ($\sim$1000 K) circumstellar dust. We propose that interactions between the nebular progenitor star and a close companion are responsible for the ejection of NGC 6537's molecular torus, the formation of a circumbinary dust disk, and the launching of fast, wandering, collimated outflows that have inflated the polar lobe bubbles traced by near-IR H$_2$ emission and are presently generating the [Fe II]-emitting shocks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">16.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust Attenuation of Lyman-Werner Feedback: Reassessing Early Super Massive Black Holes Seed Formation</a><span class="id">[2509.11111]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We investigate the impact of dust shielding on Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation fields and its implications for supermassive black hole (SMBH) seed formation at high redshift.

We find that even modest dust enrichment can significantly reduce the effective LW radiation field, allowing H2 cooling to persist in regions previously thought to be affected by LW feedback. This changes the conditions for seed formation, particularly for heavy seeds which require suppression of H2 cooling. Our results suggest that dust shielding extends the redshift range and volume where heavy seeds can form, and significantly alters the relative importance of different seed populations.

We propose that tidal disruption of a supernova (TDS) by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) can produce nuclear transients that are even more luminous than typical TDEs and are not limited by the SMBH mass. In this scenario, the SMBH can capture the supernova ejecta, which subsequently self-intersects and circularizes into an accretion disk. Based on hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the accretion rate of the TDS disk exhibits a slow decline that can last for months to decades. The peak accretion rate of a typical core-collapse SN scenario can exceed the Eddington limit for SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{7.5}\,M_\odot$, while it remains sub-Eddington for more massive SMBHs. This model provides a mechanism for triggering an energetic TDE-like flare with luminosity \(\gtrsim10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}\) in galaxies with $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{8}\,M_\odot$ or triggering turn-on changing-look AGNs.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">19.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Investigating Phosphorus Abundances in a Sample of APOGEE-2 Bulge Globular Clusters</a><span class="id">[2509.11207]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Phosphorus enhanced (P-rich; [P/Fe] &gt; 0.8) giants have been found among mildly metal-poor fiels stars, but in only one star in a globular cluster (GC), M4 (NGC 6121). Also, in a sample of bulge spheroid stars, some of them showed a moderate P-enhancement in the range +0.5 &lt; [P/Fe] &lt; +1.0. In this paper we derive the P abundance of moderately metal-poor ([Fe/H]  -1) GC stars, aiming to check if the phenomenon could be related to the unusual multiple stellar populations found in most GCs. Here we present the detection of P-moderately enhanced stars among two out of seven bulge GCs (Tonantzintla 1, and NGC 6316_, with metallicities similar to those of the bulge field P-rich stars. Using H-band high-resolution (R 22,500) spectra from the APOGEE-2 survey, we present the first high-resolution abundance analysis of [P/Fe] from the PI 16482.932 A line in a sample of selected bulge GCs. We find that all P-rich stars tend to also be N-rich, that hints at the origin of P-rich stars as second-generation stars in GCs. However no other correlations of P and other elements are found, that are usually indicators of second-generation stars. Further studies with larger samples and comparisons with field stars will be needed before any firm conclusions are drawn.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">20.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11245" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Probing Hernquist dark matter with black hole shadows: A comprehensive study of various accretions</a><span class="id">[2509.11245]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The appearance of a black hole shadow, in both astronomical observations and theoretical analysis, depends critically on the properties of the surrounding accretion. In this study, we analyse the emission and observational properties of a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Hernquist dark matter (DM) halo by considering three simplified accretion models, which have not been previously explored in such detail. Based on our findings, direct emission contributes markedly to the whole observed intensity for a Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole encircled by a geometrically thin accretion disk. The corresponding regions and measured intensities of the lensing ring, the photon ring, and direct emission are sensitive to the parameters of the Hernquist DM halo. Apart from disk accretion, we also study two spherical accretion models: static and infalling. With increasing Hernquist DM parameters, both models exhibit a significant decrease in the measured intensity, yet the photon spheres are enlarged by an increase of $\sim2\%$ to $\sim30\%$. Furthermore, Doppler de-boosting due to the infalling accretion results in darker shadow images compared to static cases. By precising visualisations of the shadows, our results suggest that the observational characteristics of black hole shadows can serve as a powerful probe for distinguishing between different DM distributions around supermassive black holes.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">21.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11299" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Orbits of Isolated Dwarfs in the Local Group from New 3D Kinematics: Constraints on First Infall, Backsplash, and Quenching Mechanisms</a><span class="id">[2509.11299]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>It is commonly supposed that quenched field dwarfs near the edge of the Local Group (LG) are backsplash galaxies, having previously orbited within the Milky Way (MW) or M31's virial radius, whereas galaxies on first infall should still have gas and star formation. We measured proper motions (PMs) for six dwarf galaxies located 400-1000 kpc from the MW using the Hubble Space Telescope. For four galaxies (Aquarius, Cetus, Pisces, Tucana), we report the first PMs. For the remaining two (Leo T and Pegasus), we measure PMs with order-of-magnitude improvement. We compute orbital histories to assess whether any of the six are backsplash galaxies. While some have non-zero likelihoods of past interaction with the MW or M31, these are weak and typically occur at large distances (e.g., $&gt;$ 2Rvir). The properties of Aquarius, Leo T, Pisces, and Pegasus are consistent with first passage through a massive halo. Cetus, which shows a low probability ( 4-6%) of interacting with the MW or M31 in the last 6 Gyr, is more likely a backsplash galaxy resulting from an interaction with M31 over 6 Gyr ago, in the same regime where rigid orbital models become less reliable. Tucana has been thought to be a backsplash galaxy, but our orbits indicate it cannot have interacted with a massive LG host. Our results highlight the diversity of evolutionary pathways for isolated, intermediate-mass dwarfs ($M_* \approx 10^5-10^7 M_{\odot}$) and the need to reassess quenching mechanisms beyond environmental interactions with massive hosts.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">22.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11351" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Demystifying Strange O VI Line Widths with Hydrodynamic Simulations</a><span class="id">[2509.11351]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a survey of O VI line widths obtained from hydrodynamic simulations that model the mixing between High Velocity Clouds and the circumgalactic medium and track the non-equilibrium ionization populations of the ions. We run 10 simulations with various physical conditions of the clouds and ambient environments, so that our results can be compared to observations of various cloud environments. Synthetic spectra are created for the simulated sight lines that contain O VI. The range of our Doppler broadening parameter, $b$, is from $\sim$6 km s$^{-1}$ to $\sim$107 km s$^{-1}$. We calculate the thermal and non-thermal contributions to the $b$ values. Both $b$ and the thermal contribution to $b$ can be substantially less than the CIE value. These narrow line widths are due to the time delay in recombination from O VI to O V in mixing regions, which results in substantial amounts of O VI at temperatures below the 2.9 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ K CIE temperature. Our results show that non equilibrium collisional ionization and mixing can produce the narrow line widths that are seen in multiple observations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">23.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11475" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dense Molecular Ring-like structure in gaseous CO depletion region G34.74-0.12</a><span class="id">[2509.11475]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report the discovery of a dense molecular ring-like structure in a dense (10$^5$ cm$^{-3}$), cold (pc-scale CO depletion at a factor of 5), and young (10$^4$ year) star-forming region G34.74-0.12, revealed by C$^{18}$O (2-1), HNC (1-0), and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). The ring-like structure is redshifted with respect to the clump, spanning from $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 0.9$ to $V_{\rm sys,lsr} + 2.9$ km s$^{-1}$, with a total mass of 109 $M_{\odot}$. It is spatially coincident with 1.3 mm and 3.0 mm dust continuum emission from cores, and several protostellar outflows. However, no free-free emission or H\textsc{ii} region is detected in association with this structure. With a slow expansion speed indicated by the position-velocity diagram, this ring structure differs from rings previously identified in more evolved star-forming regions. Possible explanations for the ring-like structure include a relic wind-blown bubble produced by a deeply embedded young stellar object, a hollow cavity formed by cloud-cloud interactions, a gas ring resulting from a temperature gradient, or a line-of-sight superposition of multiple outflows or dense clouds. This discovery offers a rare observational glimpse into the earliest dynamical processes involved in massive star formation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">24.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scaling relations at the central regions of nearby galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.11563]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Scaling relations between galactic parameters represent key pieces of evidence for investigating the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. In most studies, these relations have been obtained for large portions of the galaxies (i.e., on kpc scales), but it is also important to evaluate these relations in smaller scales. In this work, we used optical data cubes of a subsample of nearby galaxies of the DIVING 3D survey. These allowed us to analyze the scaling relations involving stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, and stellar population metallicity at the nuclear and circumnuclear regions of galaxies. We detected correlations between the stellar velocity dispersion and the age, metallicity, and total stellar mass. These correlations are independent of galaxy inclinations, considering all morphological types, nuclear activity, and the presence or absence of galactic bars. We detected, for the first time, a correlation between the stellar velocity dispersion and stellar metallicity in the nuclear regions of galaxies. It is found to be qualitatively consistent with the well-known stellar mass-metallicity relation. We also noted that barred galaxies tend to show younger and less metal-rich stellar populations than unbarred galaxies in the central regions, which may be a consequence of the bar triggering star formation in the nuclear regions of these objects. Some active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in our sample are positioned above the observed correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and stellar population age, suggesting that their nuclear stellar populations are younger than expected. This may be a consequence of positive AGN feedback, triggering star formation. Conversely, starburst galaxies do not show nuclear stellar populations at ages over one billion years.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">25.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11641" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular Jets from an Evolved Protostar: Insights from JWST-ALMA Synergy</a><span class="id">[2509.11641]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The combination of ALMA submillimeter and JWST/MIRI mid-infrared observations offers a transformative view of protostellar jets and outflows by probing cold and warm gas components across diverse physical conditions. We present a detailed comparison of gas distribution in these regimes for the jet/outflow system associated with G205.46$-$14.56S3 (HOPS 315), focusing on the inner $\sim$800 AU along the jet. ALMA CO and SiO trace both lobes of the bipolar jet, revealing high-velocity collimated jets and wider outflow components. JWST/MIRI detects mainly the blueshifted lobe; the redshifted side is likely obscured by strong mid-infrared extinction. Shorter-wavelength MIRI H$_2$ rotational lines (S(7)-S(4)) trace compact jet structures resembling SiO emission, while longer-wavelength lines (S(3)-S(1)) reveal more extended emission akin to low-velocity CO. From H$_2$ rotational emission, we identify two molecular gas temperature components: warm $(\sim 773 \pm 44 K)$ and hot $(\sim 2499\pm720 K)$. Using the ortho-to-para ratio, we estimate visual extinction $A_V \approx 23.3 \pm 2.5$ mag. JWST/MIRI emission imply a jet mass-loss rate of $\dot{M}_{J, blue, jwst} \approx (0.27 \pm 0.1) \times 10^{-6}M_\odot {yr}^{-1}$. The combination of ALMA and JWST reveals stratified layers within the outflow and jet, as well as shock structures, providing a comprehensive view of their physical conditions.

Using the $\mathtt{startrack}$ and COSMIC population synthesis codes, we investigate how different supernova mechanisms affect the observable population of SL systems, with particular attention to the mass gap (2$\mathrm{-}$5 M$_\odot$) in compact object distributions. We test three supernova remnant formation models with different convective growth timescales ($f_{\rm mix}$ = 0.5, 1.0, and 4.0), simulating SL binary systems across the Galactic disk and bulge. We identify distinct groupings of SL sources based on lens mass and Einstein crossing time, clearly differentiating neutron star from black hole systems and close from wide orbits. Notably, the delayed $f_{\rm mix} = 0.5$ model predicts a significantly higher fraction of systems with lens masses in the mass gap region (up to $\sim10$ times more for certain surveys), suggesting that SL observations could help constrain this controversial population. Our analysis reveals a strong preference for systems with low centre-of-mass velocities ($v_{\rm cm}\leq20$ km/s) across all models, resulting primarily from physical processes governing compact object formation and binary survival. While many potential detections will have limited observational coverage, ZTF is predicted to yield several dozen well-covered systems that should enable detailed characterization. When applying simple detection criteria including photometric precision and signal-to-noise requirements, predicted rates decrease by approximately two orders of magnitude, but still yield up to a few tens of expected detections for LSST and ZTF in the Galactic disk population.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">27.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11770" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dense gas properties and star formation in M 82</a><span class="id">[2509.11770]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>High-density molecular gas plays a vital role in supporting star formation within galaxies. However, traditional tracers of dense gas, such as the low-$J$ transitions of HCN and HCO$^+$, are predominantly optically thick. This characteristic presents a significant challenge in accurately estimating the column density of dense gas and mapping its spatial distribution. Optically-thin tracers, including HC$_3$N (10-9) and isotopologues of HCN, HCO$^+$, HNC (1-0), among others, emerge as better tracers, by enabling more precise measurements and analyses of the dense gas in galaxies. Here, we present the first high-resolution ($\sim$3.8$''$, corresponding to $\sim$65 pc) molecular line observations of the nearby starburst galaxy M 82 with IRAM Northern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Notably, HC$_3$N (10-9) and H$^{13}$CN (1-0) emission lines are brighter at the northeast part (NE lobe) than those at the southwest part (SW lobe) of M 82, suggesting a higher accumulation of dense gas at the NE lobe. The spatial distributions of H41$\alpha$ and 3-mm continuum emission indicate that starburst activity varies across the central starburst disk, with more intense star formation occurring at the SW lobe compared to the NE lobe. The average optical depths of HCN and HCO$^+$ (1-0) across the triple-peaked regions exhibit significant variation, with the highest values observed at the NE lobe. Our results suggest a potential evolutionary sequence in M 82, where the distributions of star formation and dense gas appear to be partially decoupled – a phenomenon that classical dense gas tracers cannot adequately probe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">28.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11771" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JWST's first view of the most vigorously star-forming cloud in the Galactic center – Sagittarius B2</a><span class="id">[2509.11771]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report JWST NIRCAM and MIRI observations of Sgr B2, the most active site of star formation in the Galaxy.

JWST has detected new candidate HII regions around massive stars previously missed by radio telescopes. MIRI has detected radiation escaping from the forming massive cluster Sgr B2 N along its outflow cavities, demonstrating that infrared radiation finds geometric escape routes even in the densest, most heavily embedded regions in the universe. JWST further highlights the gas asymmetry in the cloud, showing a sharp, straight cutoff along the eastern cloud edge. Despite the great sensitivity of these observations, no extended population of YSOs has been detected, placing a limit on their minimum extinction; this result hints that star formation has only just begun in the cloud. Together, these results suggest that, despite already holding the crown for most actively star-forming cloud, we have underestimated the total star formation in Sgr B2.

The light curves show significant variability, with fractional variability peaking at 0.75 in X-rays, 0.4 in the optical/UV, and 0.65 in $\gamma$-ray band-consistent with expectations for HSPs. Segmenting the $\gamma$-ray light curve with Bayesian blocks, we defined 253 time-resolved epochs with adequate multi-band coverage and categorized them into quiescent states (QS), multiwavelength flares (MWF), $\gamma$-ray flares ($\gamma$F), X-ray flares (XF), and optical/UV flares (OUF). Each SED is modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) framework that self-consistently evolves particle injection and cooling; a neural-network surrogate is used to accelerate parameter inference. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests reveal state-dependent parameter variations relative to QS: (i) during MWF, the magnetic field B, electron luminosity $L_{e}$, maximum electron Lorentz factor $\gamma_{max}$, and Doppler factor $\delta$ differ significantly; (ii) during $\gamma$F, a harder electron index p is estimated; (iii) XF shows higher B and $\gamma_{max}$ with a more compact emitting region; and (IV) during OUF, changes in B, $L_{e}$, $\gamma_{max}$, $\delta$, and p are found while the emitting-zone size remains approximately constant. The jet power is electron-dominated (magnetic-to-electron power ratio $\eta_{B}\simeq0.09-0.17$), with $\eta_{B}$ rising during XF.

The foreground radio brightness must also be accurately accounted for when measuring the cosmic background radiation and departures from its Planck spectrum that trace astrophysical processes in the early Universe, cosmic dark ages, cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionisation. Here we report a new, precision measurement of the sky spectral brightness over radio frequencies from 60 MHz to 350 MHz. Our measurement motivates a significant correction to previous all-sky images made in this band and the Global Sky Model (GSM) that is constructed from these and other sky images made at radio wavelengths. We find that the GSM requires subtraction of an offset exceeding 100K below 100 MHz and scaling up by a factor of approximately 1.2 below 200 MHz rising to a factor of 1.5 at 350 MHz, thus significantly enhancing previous estimates of unaccounted excess in radio sky brightness. Our measurements were made with a new receiver architecture that dynamically self-calibrates for receiver noise and bandpass in situ, while connected to an antenna. We used a single, accurately modelled, wideband logperiodic antenna placed on a 40m diameter ground mesh. Our accurate measurement requires upward revision of sky brightness and motivates revisiting models for source populations and dark matter decay. Additionally, sky models scaled to our measurements serve as a stable reference in calibrating the absolute flux density scale for low-frequency radio telescopes. This will be important for calibration accuracy of the SKA-Low telescope, that will operate at the frequencies of our measurements.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">31.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of external gas accretion on the distribution of HI gas in galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.11891]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the data from Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) and HI-MaNGA surveys, we build a sample of 37 gas-star misaligned galaxies with robust HI detections, which are believed to have undergone external gas accretion processes. Both star-forming (SF) and quiescent (QS) misaligned galaxies exhibit narrower HI linewidths compared to their gas-star aligned controls. The HI profiles of SF misaligned galaxies tend to be single-peaked, displaying a slightly higher fraction of single-peaked shape compared to their aligned controls. The QS misaligned galaxies exhibit prominently single-peaked HI profiles, while their aligned controls show distinct double-horned profiles. The shape of HI profiles is expected to change with the HI surface density radial gradients through external gas accretion – the interaction between the accreted gas and the pre-existing gas leads to the re-distribution of angular momentum and induces gas inflow. It suggests that the progenitors of SF misaligned galaxies are central HI-enriched, in this case, the shape of HI profiles is insensitive to the further increase of central HI surface density. The progenitors of QS misaligned galaxies are central HI-deficient, hence the transition from central HI-deficient to HI-enriched surface density leads to significantly more single-peaked HI profiles.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">32.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11896" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Testing CCC+TL Cosmology with Galaxy Rotation Curves</a><span class="id">[2509.11896]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>This paper aims to explore whether astrophysical observations, primarily galaxy rotation curves, result from covarying coupling constants (CCC) rather than from dark matter. We have shown in earlier papers that cosmological observations, such as supernovae type 1a (Pantheon+), the small size of galaxies at cosmic dawn, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), the sound horizon in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and time dilation effect, can be easily accounted for without requiring dark energy and dark matter when coupling constants are permitted to evolve in an expanding Universe, as predicted by Dirac, and the redshift is considered jointly due to the Universe's expansion and Zwicky's tired light (TL) effect. Here, we show that the CCC parameter {\alpha} is responsible for generating the illusion of dark matter and dark energy, which we call {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy, and is influenced by the baryonic matter density distribution. While cosmologically {\alpha} is a constant determined for the homogenous and isotropic Universe, e.g., by fitting Pantheon+ data, it can vary locally due to the extreme anisotropy of the matter distribution. Thus, in high baryonic density regions, one expects {\alpha}-matter and {\alpha}-energy densities to be relatively low and vice versa. We present its application to a few galaxy rotation curves from the SPARC database and find the results promising.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">33.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11909" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dust trapping in protoplanetary discs after stellar flybys</a><span class="id">[2509.11909]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar flybys are likely to be common in young star-forming regions and could be responsible for substructures observed in protoplanetary discs.

We present an analysis of these predicted radio galaxy morphologies for the RGZ catalogue, classified using a pre-trained radio galaxy foundation model that has been fine-tuned to predict Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphology. As seen in previous studies, our results show overlap between morphologically classified FRI and FRII luminosity-size distributions and we find that the model's confidence in its predictions is lowest in this overlap region, suggesting that source morphologies are more ambiguous. We identify the presence of low-luminosity FRII sources, the proportion of which, with respect to the total number of FRIIs, is consistent with previous studies. However, a comparison of the low-luminosity FRII sources found in this work with those identified by previous studies reveals differences that may indicate their selection is influenced by the choice of classification methodology. We investigate the impacts of both pre-training and fine-tuning data selection on model performance for the downstream classification task, and show that while different pre-training data choices affect model confidence they do not appear to cause systematic generalisation biases for the range of physical and observational characteristics considered in this work; however, we note that the same is not necessarily true for fine-tuning. As automated approaches to astronomical source identification and classification become increasingly prevalent, we highlight training data choices that can affect the model outputs and propagate into downstream analyses.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">36.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12035" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The dependence of the Type Ia Supernova colour-luminosity relation on their host galaxy properties</a><span class="id">[2509.12035]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Using the Dark Energy Survey 5-year sample, we determine the properties of type Ia supernova (SN Ia) host galaxies across a wide multi-wavelength range - from the optical to far-infrared - including data from the $Herschel$ and $Spitzer$ space telescopes. We categorise the SNe Ia into three distinct groups according to the distribution of their host galaxies on the star-formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_\star$) plane. Each region comprises host galaxies at distinct stages in their evolutionary pathways: Region 1 - low-mass hosts; Region 2 - high-mass, star-forming hosts and Region 3 - high-mass, passive hosts. We find SNe Ia in host galaxies located in Region 1 have the steepest slope (quantified by $\beta$) between their colours and luminosities, with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_1}} = 3.51 \pm 0.16$. This differs at the ${\sim}6\sigma$ significance level to SNe Ia in Region 3, which have the shallowest colour-luminosity slope with $\beta_{\mathrm{R_3}} = 2.12 \pm 0.16$. After correcting SNe Ia in each subsample by their respective $\beta$, events in Region 3 (high-mass, passive hosts) are $0.07 - 0.12$ mag ($&gt;3\sigma$) brighter, post-standardisation. We conclude that future cosmological analyses should apply standardisation relations to SNe Ia based upon the region in which the SN host galaxy lies in the SFR-$M_\star$ plane. Alternatively, cosmological analyses should restrict the SN Ia sample to events whose host galaxies occupy a single region of this plane.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">37.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12058" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Characterization of Two Cool Galaxy Outflow Candidates Using Mid-Infrared Emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</a><span class="id">[2509.12058]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We characterize two candidate cool galactic outflows in two relatively low mass, highly inclined Virgo cluster galaxies: NGC4424 and NGC4694. Previous analyses of observations using the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) carbon monoxide (CO) line emission maps did not classify these sources as cool outflow hosts. Using new high sensitivity, high spatial resolution, JWST mid-infrared photometry in the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)-tracing F770W band, we identify extended structures present off of the stellar disk. The identified structures are bright in the MIRI F770W and F2100W bands, suggesting they include PAHs as well as other dust grains. As PAHs have been shown to be destroyed in hot, ionized gas, these structures are likely to be outflows of cool (T$\leq 10^4$K) gas. This work represents an exciting possibility for using mid infrared observations to identify and measure outflows in lower mass, lower star formation galaxies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">38.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12067" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observational Evidence of Dust Evolution in Supernova Remnants: Size Redistribution Toward Larger Grains in Early Sedov Phase</a><span class="id">[2509.12067]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Recent observations have revealed that dust is widespread and abundant in galaxies up to $z\,{\backsimeq}\,8$, significantly influencing their appearance and spectral properties. In the early Universe, dust is thought to form primarily in supernova (SN) ejecta, but also undergoes destruction by the reverse shock. Studying dust in local supernova remnants (SNRs) of different sizes and ages thus provides key constraints on dust formation and evolution during cosmic dawn. Using the newly released 3D $R_{\rm V}$ map, we derived local $R_{\rm V} \equiv A_{\rm V}/E(B-V)$ values for dust in 14 Galactic SNRs in the early Sedov phase and their surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). For the first time, we detect a moderately strong positive correlation between the difference in SNR and ISM $R_{\rm V}$ ($\Delta R_{\rm V}$) and SNR radius ($R_{\rm SNR}$), with a Spearman coefficient of $r_{\rm s}\,{=}\,0.62\,{\pm}\,0.14$. This trend offers direct observational evidence for a redistribution of dust grain sizes toward larger grains during SN shock processing, consistent with theoretical models. Our findings provide essential observational constraints on dust size evolution in SNRs and important implications for understanding the rapid enrichment and survival of dust in the early Universe.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">39.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12082" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YOLO-CIANNA: Galaxy detection with deep learning in radio data: II.

In this study, we aim to generalize the YOLO-CIANNA deep learning source detection and characterization method for 3D hyperspectral HI emission cubes. We present the adaptations we made to the regression-based detection formalism and the construction of an end-to-end 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) backbone. We then describe a processing pipeline for applying the method to simulated 3D HI cubes from the SKA Observatory Science Data Challenge 2 (SDC2) dataset. The YOLO-CIANNA method was originally developed and used by the MINERVA team that won the official SDC2 competition. Despite the public release of the full SDC2 dataset, no published result has yet surpassed MINERVA's top score. In this paper, we present an updated version of our method that improves our challenge score by 9.5%. The resulting catalog exhibits a high detection purity of 92.3%, best-in-class characterization accuracy, and contains 45% more confirmed sources than concurrent classical detection tools. The method is also computationally efficient, processing the full  1TB SDC2 data cube in 30 min on a single GPU. These state-of-the-art results highlight the effectiveness of 3D CNN-based detectors for processing large hyperspectral data cubes and represent a promising step toward applying YOLO-CIANNA to observational data from SKA and its precursors.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">40.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-energy interstellar isomers: cis-N-methylformamide in the G+0.693-0.027 molecular cloud</a><span class="id">[2509.12097]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Isomerism in complex organic molecules provides key insights into the formation mechanisms and physical conditions of the interstellar medium (ISM). Among the C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers, only acetamide and trans-N-methylformamide (trans-NMF) have been detected in space. The recent detection of higher-energy isomers in other chemical families raises questions about the formation and abundance of less stable isomers. We used ultra-sensitive wide-band spectral surveys obtained with the Yebes 40 m and IRAM 30 m telescopes to search for cis-NMF towards the Galactic Centre molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. We present the first detection of cis-NMF in the ISM, with 55 unblended or slightly blended transitions, 44 of which were new transitions identified based on extrapolated spectroscopic data. Due to the lack of collisional rate coefficients, a quasi-non-LTE analysis, which separated the transitions into different K$_a$ ladders, was used to determine the excitation conditions. The resulting trans/cis-NMF isomeric ratio of 2.9$\pm$0.6 deviates significantly from thermodynamic expectations, suggesting that kinetic non-equilibrium processes and stereospecific chemical pathways are responsible for the formation of cis-NMF in this environment. The detection of cis-NMF expands the known inventory of interstellar C$_2$H$_5$NO isomers and challenges the assumption that isomer abundances strictly correlate with thermodynamic stability. Laboratory and theoretical studies propose formation via CH$_3$NCO hydrogenation or spin-forbidden reactions involving CH$_2$ and NH$_2$CHO, though these may not reflect typical ISM conditions. This finding highlights the need for further investigation into isomerisation mechanisms and constrains astrochemical models of complex organic molecules.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">41.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12128" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pressure Regulated Formation of Molecular Clouds and Stars: The case of the Milky Way</a><span class="id">[2509.12128]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a steady-state analytical model for pressure-regulated formation of molecular clouds (MC) and stars (SF) in gaseous galactic disks and apply it to the Milky Way (MW). MC formation depends on midplane interstellar pressure $P_{\text{ISM}}$ and metallicity $Z$, and for galactocentric distances $R\gtrsim5$ kpc, $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ scales approximately linearly with molecular gas surface density $\Sigma_{\rm mol}(R)$. The molecularization of the cold neutral medium (CNM) is due to the opacity of small dust grains that protect the center of the cloud from dissociating radiation when the column density is $\Sigma_d\geq 5\ (Z/Z_\odot)M_\odot\text{ pc}^{-2}$. The H$_2$ formation rate per hydrogen atom is $F\sim10^{-15}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)T_{100}^{-1/2}\text{s}^{-1}$, and the corresponding formation rate per unit area is $\dot{\Sigma}^{+}_{\rm mol}\sim 5\times10^{-2}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/{P_\odot}\right)T_{100}^{-1/2}M_\odot~\text{kpc}^{-2}~\text{yr}^{-1}$, where $P_\odot$ is the pressure at the solar circle and $T_{100}=T/100\text{ K}$ is the temperature of the cloud. In equilibrium, this equals the molecular gas destruction rate $\dot{\Sigma}^{-}_{\rm mol}$ due to SF. Self-gravity sets in when the column density of a cloud reaches $\Sigma_{\rm sg}=\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot)^{1/2}$, with $\Sigma_{\rm sg,\odot}\sim30\ M_\odot\ \text{pc}^{-2}$. Given the distribution of $P_{\text{ISM}}(R)$ and $Z(R)$ in the MW, the SF process at $5\lesssim R\lesssim11$ kpc follows a two-step track: first, MCs form from CNM gas and then they form stars when self-gravity sets in. The resulting SFR surface density is $\Sigma_\text{SFR}(R)\approx (1.6-4)\times10^{-3}\left(P_{\text{ISM}}/P_\odot\right)\ \text{M}_\odot~\text {kpc}^{-2}\text{yr}^{-1}$ with an average final SF efficiency of $\epsilon_{\rm sf}\sim (3-8)\times 10^{-2}$.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">42.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12156" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Negative gas-phase metallicity gradients in the narrow line region and galactic disc of local AGN-host galaxies</a><span class="id">[2509.12156]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The gas-phase metallicity distribution in galaxies provides significant information on their evolution.

Our sample includes nine objects found in three JWST wide survey fields, which have z=3.624 to 5.378 and M_B   -18.3 to -21.4 mag. Their light distributions follow gaussian profiles, with the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) values only 3.7%–34.6% larger than those of the point spread functions. Their sharpest FWHM sizes correspond to only 0.49 to 0.96 kpc. They have very strong [O III] and Halpha lines (median rest-frame equivalent widths of 1610.6 and 1374.0 A, respectively), and the line widths of the latter are only 150–360 km/s. Due to the limitation of the current data, the exact nature of this new population is still uncertain. The emission line diagnostics shows that at least one object is consistent with being AGN. On the other hand, the spectral energy distributions of most of the nine objects can be fitted reasonably by normal galaxy templates, which suggest that they could also be very young (median age of 120 Myrs), star-forming (median star formation rate of 1.8 Msun/yr) galaxies in the early formation stage (having acquired a median stellar mass of only 10^{8.4} Msun). If they are indeed star-forming galaxies, their gas-phase metallicities range from 12+log(O/H) = 7.8 to 8.3. It will be critical to understand this population by deeper medium-resolution spectroscopy in the future. If they are AGNs, they constitute a new kind of type 2 AGNs that are low-luminosity and almost &quot;hostless&quot;. If they are star-forming galaxies, they also constitute a new kind whose early formation is likely a secular process starting from a very compact core, which is in line with the picture of a monolithic collapse.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">44.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exploring Multi-view Symbolic Regression methods in physical sciences</a><span class="id">[2509.10500]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Describing the world behavior through mathematical functions help scientists to achieve a better understanding of the inner mechanisms of different phenomena. Traditionally, this is done by deriving new equations from first principles and careful observations. A modern alternative is to automate part of this process with symbolic regression (SR). The SR algorithms search for a function that adequately fits the observed data while trying to enforce sparsity, in the hopes of generating an interpretable equation. A particularly interesting extension to these algorithms is the Multi-view Symbolic Regression (MvSR). It searches for a parametric function capable of describing multiple datasets generated by the same phenomena, which helps to mitigate the common problems of overfitting and data scarcity. Recently, multiple implementations added support to MvSR with small differences between them. In this paper, we test and compare MvSR as supported in Operon, PySR, phy-SO, and eggp, in different real-world datasets. We show that they all often achieve good accuracy while proposing solutions with only few free parameters. However, we find that certain features enable a more frequent generation of better models. We conclude by providing guidelines for future MvSR developments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">45.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gravitational wave energy spectral density properties from BPASS Galactic binary population in the Milky Way galaxy</a><span class="id">[2411.02563]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We analyse the energy spectral density properties of Gravitational waves from Galactic binary populations in the \text{mHz} band targeted by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna mission.

In this study, we use high-resolution simulations of a hydrodynamical, gravitationally stratified, supernova (SNe)-driven, multiphase ISM to probe the nature of a galactic turbulence cascade. Through the use of velocity flux transfer functions split into interactions between compressible $\mathbf{u}_c$ and incompressible $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes, we show that there exists a large-to-small-scale cascade in both $\mathbf{u}_c$ and $\mathbf{u}_s$ when mediated by an additional $\mathbf{u}_s$ mode. But the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade is highly non-local. Moreover, there is a $\mathbf{u}_c$ mediated component of the $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascade that proceeds in the opposite direction – an inverse cascade from small-to-large scales. The cascade feeds flux into scales well beyond the scale height, energizing the winds and fueling the direct cascades. Both the strongly non-local and the inverse $\mathbf{u}_s$ cascades happen on scales that have a power law $\mathbf{u}_s$ energy spectrum, highlighting how degenerate the spectrum is to the true underlying physical processes. We directly show that the inverse cascade comes from $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes interacting with expanding SNe remnants (SNRs) and that $\mathbf{u}_s$ modes are generated to leading order via baroclinic, highly corrugated cooling layers between warm $(T\lesssim 10^4\,\rm{K})$ and hot $(T\gg10^4\,\rm{K})$ gas in these SNRs. Finally, we outline a complete phenomenology for SNe-driven turbulence in a galactic disk, estimate a $10^{-16}\,\rm{G}$ Biermann field generated from SNR cooling layers, and highlight the strong deviations that SNe-driven turbulence has from the conventional Kolmogorov model.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">47.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16603" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaxy mergers classification using CNNs trained on Sérsic models, residuals and raw images</a><span class="id">[2502.16603]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Galaxy mergers are crucial for understanding galaxy evolution, and with large upcoming datasets, automated methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are needed for efficient detection.

Using images from the IllustrisTNG simulations, we aim to check the importance of faint features, source position and shape information present in galaxy merger images on the performance of a CNN merger vs. non-merger classifier. We fit Sérsic profiles to each galaxy in mock images from the IllustrisTNG simulations.

We found that it is possible to conduct galaxy merger classification based only on faint features, source position and shape information present in residual images and model images, respectively. The results show that the CNN1 correctly classifies 74% of images, while CNN2 70%, and CNN3 68%.

Their structures are commonly attributed to planetary perturbations, serving as probes of as-yet-undetected planets. However, most studies of planet-debris disc interactions ignore the disc's gravity, treating it as a collection of massless planetesimals. Here, using an analytical model, we investigate how the vertical structure of a back-reacting debris disc responds to secular perturbations from an inner, inclined planet. Considering the disc's axisymmetric potential, we identify two dynamical regimes: planet-dominated and disc-dominated, which may coexist, separated by a secular-inclination resonance. In the planet-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\ll1$), we recover the classical result: a transient warp propagates outward until the disc settles into a box-like structure centered around the planetary orbit's initial inclination $I_p(0)$, with a distance-independent aspect ratio $\mathcal{H}(R)\approx I_p(0)$. In contrast, in the disc-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\gtrsim1$), the disc exhibits dynamical rigidity, remaining thin and misaligned, with significantly suppressed inclinations and a sharply declining aspect ratio, $\mathcal{H}(R)\propto I_p(0)R^{-7/2}$. In the intermediate regime ($M_d/m_p\lesssim1$), the system exhibits a secular-inclination resonance, leading to long-lived, warp-like structures and a bimodal inclination distribution, containing both dynamically hot and cold populations. We provide analytic formulae describing these effects as a function of system parameters. We also find that the vertical density profile is intrinsically non-Gaussian and recommend fitting observations with non-zero slopes of $\mathcal{H}(R)$. Our results may be used to infer planetary parameters and debris disc masses based on observed warps and scale heights, as demonstrated for HD 110058 and $\beta$ Pic.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">51.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13161" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Star Formation and Chemical Evolution Histories of Ursa Minor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</a><span class="id">[2505.13161]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We derive the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution history (CEH) of the Ursa Minor (UMi) dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). We detect two distinct stellar populations that exist over 6 times half-light radius from its center. The results are obtained by applying a newly developed algorithm to the deep and wide-field photometric dataset taken with Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. The algorithm employs the genetic algorithm and the simulated annealing to minimize a $\chi^{2}$ value between the observed color-magnitude diagram (CMD) and synthetic CMD generated from the stellar isochrones. The age and metallicity resolutions are set to $0.5$ Gyr and $0.1$ dex, respectively. The accuracy assessment with mock galaxies shows that it returns the peaks of metallicity distributions and star formation period within 1 $\sigma$ of input value in the case of a single population. In tests with two populations, two distinct metallicity peaks are identified without an offset from the input values, indicating the robustness of this algorithm. The detected two populations in the UMi dSph have the metallicity peaks of [Fe/H] = $-2.2$ and $-2.5$; the metal-rich population started its star formation about 1 Gyr later than the metal-poor one. The SFH of both metal-rich and metal-poor populations varies with distance from the center of the UMi dSph, without any age-gradients. These results suggest that the UMi dSph underwent a complex formation process, contrary to the simple formation history of dwarf galaxies previously thought.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">52.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18685" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The long-term stability of the Vast Polar Structure and its connection to a possible previous passage of the LMC</a><span class="id">[2507.18685]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Vast Polar Structure (VPOS) is a thin, planar arrangement of co-orbiting dwarf galaxies, nearly perpendicular to the Milky Way (MW) disc. In this work we investigate the persistence and stability of the VPOS over time. We identify VPOS member galaxies and integrate their orbits over the past 5 Gyr using time evolving gravitational potentials that account for the mutual interaction between the MW and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The reconstructed trajectories allow us to examine the long-term evolution of the VPOS. We identify 15 galaxies as members of the VPOS, including 9 MW and 6 LMC satellites. We find that the VPOS has remained a stable structure, maintaining a roughly constant thickness ($\sim$ 15 kpc), flattening ($c/a \sim$ 0.2), and orientation over time. While the LMC exerts a strong gravitational influence on the MW satellites, its impact on the VPOS is limited, leading only to mild perturbations. The structural properties of the VPOS remain almost unchanged, whether or not LMC satellites are included in the analysis, indicating a smooth dynamical integration with the rest of VPOS members upon entering the MW virial radius. This minimal dynamical impact on the VPOS results from the remarkable alignment between the LMC's orbit and the plane's orientation. We conclude that the VPOS is a stable, long-lived structure that predates the recent infall of the LMC and retains nearly constant structural properties over the last 5 Gyrs. Our findings suggest a strong connection between the VPOS and the LMC, consistent with a scenario in which the LMC is on its second pericentre and the VPOS originated primarily from satellites stripped during the first passage.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">53.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The IACOB project XV. Updated calibrations of fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars</a><span class="id">[2508.05233]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Modern spectroscopic surveys combined with Gaia distances are enabling reliable estimates of fundamental parameters for hundreds of Galactic O-type stars and the full range of spectral types and luminosity classes. Here we provide updated, statistically robust empirical calibrations of the fundamental parameters of Galactic O-type stars, as well as of their absolute visual magnitudes (Mv) and bolometric corrections (BC), based on high-quality observational data. We perform a homogeneous analysis of a sample of 358 Galactic O-type stars, combining high-resolution spectroscopy and Gaia distances. A subset of 234 stars meeting strict quality criteria involving parallax, extinction, and multi-band photometry was used to derive empirical calibrations of fundamental parameters. For those same stars, calibrated parameters were estimated from their measured Mv using the derived relations, allowing us to assess the internal consistency and predictive power of the calibrations. We present updated spectral-type-based calibrations of fundamental parameters for luminosity classes V, III, and I. Compared to previous works, we find systematic shifts, particularly in effective temperature for dwarfs and in Mv across all classes, which propagate into derived quantities. Applying the Mv calibrations to the full sample yields consistent estimates of radius and luminosity, while spectroscopic mass (Msp) shows significant scatter. We also evaluate the FW3414 parameter (from the Hbeta line) as a calibrator for Mv, useful in large surveys lacking reliable spectral classification. Excluding SB1 systems has a noticeable impact only on the Msp calibration for LC V. These updated empirical calibrations offer a robust reference for Galactic O-type stars and will support studies of massive star populations in both Galactic and extragalactic contexts, particularly in the era of large spectroscopic surveys.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">54.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</a><span class="id">[2508.11996]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian “outlier” is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">55.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03283" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos</a><span class="id">[2509.03283]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$–$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$–$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$–$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of 'little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">56.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A fast machine learning tool to predict the composition of astronomical ices from infrared absorption spectra</a><span class="id">[2509.04331]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Current observations taken by James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) allow us to observe the absorption features of icy mantles that cover interstellar dust grains, which are mainly composed of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO_2}$, along with other minor species. Thanks to its sensitivity and spectral resolution, JWST has the potential to observe ice features towards hundreds of sources at different stages along the process of star formation. However, identifying the spectral features of the different species and quantifying the ice composition is not trivial and requires complex spectroscopic analysis. We present Automatic Ice Composition Estimator (AICE), a new tool based on artificial neural networks. Based on the infrared (IR) ice absorption spectrum between 2.5 and 10 microns, AICE predicts the ice fractional composition in terms of $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{CO}$, $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{CH_3OH}$, $\mathrm{NH_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$. To train the model, we used hundreds of laboratory experiments of ice mixtures from different databases, which were reprocessed with baseline subtraction and normalisation. Once trained, AICE takes less than one second on a conventional computer to predict the ice composition associated with the observed IR absorption spectrum, with typical errors of $\sim$3 $\%$ in the species fraction. We tested its performance on two spectra reported towards the NIR38 and J110621 background stars observed within the JWST Ice Age program, demonstrating a good agreement with previous estimations of the ice composition. The fast and accurate performance of AICE enables the systematic analysis of hundreds of different ice spectra with a modest time investment. In addition, this model can be enhanced and re-trained with more laboratory data, improving the precision of the predictions and expanding the list of predicted species.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">57.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04562" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nuclear Stellar Discs</a><span class="id">[2509.04562]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We review our current understanding of nuclear stellar discs (NSDs), rotating, and flattened stellar structures found in the central regions of both early- and late-type galaxies. We examine their demographics, kinematics, stellar populations, metallicity gradients and star formation histories. We derive scaling relations linking NSDs to properties of their host galaxies, and compare them with analogous relations for nuclear star clusters. The relationship between NSDs and other central galactic components, including nuclear rings, nuclear bars, and nuclear star clusters, is explored. The role of NSDs as tracers of the secular evolution of barred galaxies is highlighted, emphasising how they can be used to constrain properties of galactic bars such as their ages. Special attention is given to the Milky Way's NSD, which serves as a unique case study thanks to its proximity and the ability to resolve individual stars. The review covers the Milky Way's NSD structure, kinematics, dynamics and stellar content, addressing ongoing debates about the presence of a nuclear bar and implications of the latter for central gas dynamics. We argue that NSDs form by in-situ star formation, most of them because of bar-driven gas inflow, but possibly in some cases because of external acquisition of gas during a gas-rich merger. The review concludes by outlining open questions, future research directions and the exciting prospects provided by upcoming observational facilities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">58.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation</a><span class="id">[2509.06787]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2–3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">59.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10387" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The large-scale kinematics of young stars in the Milky Way disc: first results from SDSS-V</a><span class="id">[2509.10387]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We present a first large-scale kinematic map of $\sim$50,000 young OB stars ($T_{\rm eff} \geq 10,000$ K), based on BOSS spectroscopy from the Milky Way Mapper OB program in the ongoing Sloan Digital Sky Survey V (SDSS-V). Using photogeometric distances, line-of-sight velocities and Gaia DR3 proper motions, we map 3D Galactocentric velocities across the Galactic plane to $\sim$5 kpc from the Sun, with a focus on radial motions ($v_R$). Our results reveal mean radial motion with amplitudes of $\pm 30$ km/s that are coherent on kiloparsec scales, alternating between inward and outward motions. These $\bar{v}_R$ amplitudes are considerably higher than those observed for older, red giant populations. These kinematic patterns show only a weak correlation with spiral arm over-densities. Age estimates, derived from MIST isochrones, indicate that 85% of the sample is younger than $\sim300$ Myr and that the youngest stars ($\le 30$ Myr) align well with density enhancements. The age-dependent $\bar{v}_R$ in Auriga makes it plausible that younger stars exhibits different velocity variations than older giants. The origin of the radial velocity features remains uncertain, and may result from a combination of factors, including spiral arm dynamics, the Galactic bar, resonant interactions, or phase mixing following a perturbation. The present analysis is based on approximately one-third of the full target sample. The completed survey will enable a more comprehensive investigation of these features and a detailed dynamical interpretation.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">60.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Euclid: Early Release Observations – The star cluster systems of the Local Group dwarf galaxies IC 10 and NGC 6822</a><span class="id">[2509.10440]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Star clusters are valuable indicators of galaxy evolution, offering insights into the buildup of stellar populations across cosmic time. Understanding intrinsic star cluster populations of dwarf galaxies is particularly important given their role in the hierarchical growth of larger systems. Using Euclid Early Release Observation data, we study star clusters in two star-forming dwarf irregulars in the Local Group, NGC 6822 and IC 10 [$M_\star \sim$ (1–4) $\times10^8 M_\odot$]. With Euclid, clusters are resolved into individual stars across the main bodies and haloes of both galaxies. Visual inspection of $I_E$ images uncovers 30 new cluster candidates in NGC 6822 and 16 in IC 10, from compact to extended clusters. We re-evaluate literature candidates, producing combined catalogues of 52 (NGC 6822) and 71 (IC 10) clusters with confidence-based classifications. We present homogeneous photometry in $I_E$, $Y_E$, $J_E$, $H_E$, and archival UBVRI data, alongside size measurements and properties from BAGPIPES SED fitting. Synthetic cluster injection shows our sample is $\sim 50$% complete to $M \lesssim 10^3 M_\odot$ for ages $\lesssim 100$ Myr, and to $M \lesssim 3\times10^4 M_\odot$ for $\sim 10$ Gyr. IC 10 has more young clusters than NGC 6822, extending to higher masses, consistent with its starburst nature. Both dwarfs host several old massive ($\gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$) clusters, including an exceptional $1.3 \times 10^6 M_\odot$ cluster in NGC 6822's outskirts. In NGC 6822, we identify a previously undetected, old, extended cluster ($R_h = 12.4 \pm 0.11$ pc). Using well-defined criteria, we identify 11 candidate GCs in NGC 6822 and eight in IC 10.

By harnessing diverse states of matter, contemporary tabletop setups now replicate strong-field phenomena typically confined to the enigmatic regions surrounding black holes. Through these modern gravity simulators, physical processes once considered elusive may finally be brought into experimental reach. In this work, we investigate the spectrum of massless scalar excitations propagating within the effective geometry of a rotating acoustic metric. Specifically, we build an analog vortex-like spacetime endowed with a tunable parameter that emulates the geometry of a rotating gravitational background. This model accommodates both the presence of a sonic horizon, characteristic of an acoustic black hole for non-zero tuning parameters, and its absence when the parameter vanishes, yielding a horizonless, purely rotational vortex flow devoid of radial inflow. We focus on the case where the vortex flow is purely rotational. The resulting spectral properties is found to be qualitatively consistent with that observed in recent experimental realizations of giant multiply quantum vortices featuring solid or hollow cores. This correspondence suggests that the analog spacetime used here holds significant potential to replicate, qualitatively, the phenomenology of cutting-edge laboratory experiments. In doing so, it offers new insight into the intricate landscape of analog black-hole spectroscopy and, potentially, the resonant topography of bounded, rotating astrophysical environments around black holes.</p></div></details></article>

Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning approach combining Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection in synthetic data. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. The LSTM autoencoder learns compressed representations while maintaining sensitivity to subtle signal features distinguishing true astrophysical events from noise artifacts. We generate realistic synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses, embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics: 92.3 percent precision, 67.6 percent recall, and 80.6 percent AUC-ROC, with an average precision score of 0.780. These results exceed LIGO's stringent detection thresholds for confident gravitational wave identification. Compared to traditional approaches, the CWT-LSTM autoencoder shows superior ability to maintain low false alarm rates while preserving sensitivity to weak signals. The method's end-to-end learning eliminates hand-crafted features and template banks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust gravitational wave detection systems. The unsupervised nature enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies, providing complementary &quot;blind search&quot; capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">64.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10619" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LEO-Vetter: Fully Automated Flux- and Pixel-Level Vetting of TESS Planet Candidates to Support Occurrence Rates</a><span class="id">[2509.10619]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has identified several thousand planet candidates orbiting a wide variety of stars, and has provided an exciting opportunity for demographic studies. However, current TESS planet searches require significant manual inspection efforts to identify planets among the enormous number of detected transit-like signatures, which limits the scope of such searches. Demographic studies also require a detailed understanding of the relationship between observed and true exoplanet populations; a task for which current TESS planet catalogs are rendered unsuitable by the subjectivity of vetting by eye. We present LEO-Vetter, a publicly available and fully automated exoplanet vetting system designed after the Kepler Robovetter, which is capable of efficiently producing catalogs of promising planet candidates and making statistically robust TESS demographic studies possible. LEO-Vetter implements flux- and pixel-level tests against noise/systematic false positives and astrophysical false positives. The vetter achieves high completeness (91%) and high reliability against noise/systematic false alarms (97%) based on its performance on simulated data. We demonstrate the usefulness of the vetter by searching  200,000 M dwarf light curves, and reducing  20,000 transit-like detections down to 172 uniformly vetted planet candidates. LEO-Vetter facilitates analyses that would otherwise be impractical to perform on all possible signals due to time constraints or computational limitations. Users will be able to efficiently produce their own TESS planet catalog starting with transit-like detections, as well as have the framework needed to characterize their catalog's completeness and reliability for occurrence rates.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">65.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10992" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joint Bayesian calibration and map-making for intensity mapping experiments</a><span class="id">[2509.10992]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Line intensity maps have high dynamic range, and demand careful spectral and spatial calibration.

Detecting this signal has been a challenge for astronomers since it was first postulated due to the presence of strong galactic foregrounds obfuscating the transition. Forward modelling techniques that aim to simulate and then remove these foregrounds have been suggested as a workaround to this problem. This technique, however, requires a precise and accurate understanding of the foregrounds in question. As we move into the next major lunar standstill, the moon will be able to occult high power areas of the sky in ways that are unaccounted for by maps used to simulate these foregrounds, and thereby disrupt signal recovery. We show that in toy cases an occultation from the moon, or other proximate object, leading to a mismatch in our expected and actual foregrounds of 15 parts per million increases the error in signal recovery of up to 20\%. We show that this level of disruption can happen when the moon is found towards the centre of the galaxy and is amplified when this alignment happens at high directivity regions of the antenna beam, causing a disruption of up to 180 parts per million, leading to a signal recovery error of 115\%. This allows us to identify lunar alignment scenarios that should be actively avoided to preserve signal fidelity. We also demonstrate that a body with a smaller apparent size than the moon, such as Venus, is unlikely to cause any signal disruption due to occultation, giving a base map error of &lt;2 parts per million.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">68.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11850" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Education and Outreach Across Seventeen Countries of the Pierre Auger Collaboration</a><span class="id">[2509.11850]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The Pierre Auger Observatory, dedicated to measuring ultra-high energy cosmic rays, has been promoting for more than two decades educational and scientific outreach activities to make its results known in an understandable language to diverse audiences.

We demonstrate that high-precision cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments like the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), though designed for cosmology, offer a unique capability for such time-domain science due to their high cadence and broad sky coverage in millimeter bands. While previous ACT searches have focused on transients lasting minutes or longer, we develop and validate analysis methods to search for periodic, millisecond-scale transients, a capability not typically associated with CMB experiments. We describe a phase-resolved mapmaking approach, which leverages the known periodicity of the signal to enhance sensitivity and offers advantages in diagnosing systematic errors. We also introduce a template-based fit to the raw data timestreams that independently validate our results. Applying these methods to estimate the millimeter flux of the Crab Pulsar (PSR B0531+21), we derive 95% confidence upper limits of 4.6 mJy, 4.4 mJy, and 20.7 mJy on the pulsar's period-averaged flux density at 96 GHz, 148 GHz, and 225 GHz, respectively. These constraints fill a gap in our knowledge of the Crab Pulsar's spectral energy distribution, suggesting that it does not significantly flatten or invert at millimeter wavelengths.

Here, we show that most of daily and hourly periodic variations in visible light brightness of the high corona (up to 15 Rs) are aligned to the tip of streamers and are consistent with the periodicity of plasma release from simulations of tearing-induced magnetic reconnection at the heliospheric current sheet. The areas in which we detect periodicities can be used as tracers of non-quiescent fine coronal rays. This also allows their distinction from coronal rays more likely to be real quiescent features or associated with smaller and/or faster unresolved brightness variations. In the low- and middle-corona (down to 1.4 Rs) similar brightness variations are observed along loop-like and cusp-like features marking boundaries of streamers which then connect to radial features in the high corona. This suggests the presence of additional mechanisms in the low- and middle-corona periodically releasing density structures in the solar wind. The periodicity distributions show a solar cycle modulation with shorter periods (smaller structures) during solar maximum. Periodicities are observed within streamers during solar minimum, but are visible at all latitudes, even extending radially from the poles, during solar maximum.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">72.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11743" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High-Precision Measurement of D($γ$, $n$)$p$ Photodisintegration Reaction and Implications for Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis</a><span class="id">[2509.11743]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We report on a high-precision measurement of the D($\gamma$, $n$)$p$ photodisintegration reaction at the newly commissioned Shanghai Laser Electron Gamma Source (SLEGS), employing a quasi-monochromatic $\gamma$-ray beam from Laser Compton Scattering. The cross sections were determined over $E_\gamma$=2.327-7.089 MeV, achieving up to a factor of 2.2 improvement in precision near the neutron separation threshold. Combined with previous data in a global Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using dibaryon effective field theory, we obtained the unprecedentedly precise $p$($n$, $\gamma$)D cross sections and thermonuclear rate, with a precision up to 3.8 times higher than previous evaluations. Implemented in a standard Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) framework, this new rate decreases uncertainty of the key cosmological parameter of baryon density $\Omega_b h^2$ by up to $\approx$16% relative to the LUNA result. A residual $\approx$1.2$\sigma$ tension between $\Omega_b h^2$ constrained from primordial D/H observations and CMB measurements persists, highlighting the need for improved $dd$ reaction rates and offering potential hints of new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">73.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can LIGO Detect Daylight Savings Time?</a><span class="id">[2509.11849]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Yes, it can.

This experiment would probe unexplored ranges of the possible couplings of bosonic ultralight dark matter (ULDM) to atomic constituents and undertake a pioneering search for gravitational waves (GWs) at frequencies intermediate between those to which existing and planned experiments are sensitive, among other fundamental physics studies. A conceptual feasibility study showed that this AI experiment could be isolated from the LHC by installing a shielding wall in the TX46 gallery, and surveyed issues related to the proximity of the LHC machine, finding no technical obstacles. A detailed technical implementation study has shown that the preparatory civil-engineering work, installation of bespoke radiation shielding, deployment of access-control systems and safety alarms, and installation of an elevator platform could be carried out during LS3, allowing installation and operation of the detector to proceed during Run 4 without impacting HL-LHC operation. These studies have established that PX46 is a uniquely promising location for an AI experiment. We foresee that, if the CERN management encourages this Letter of Intent, a significant fraction of the Terrestrial Very Long Baseline Atom Interferometer (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration may wish to contribute to such an AI experiment.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">75.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An Optomechanical Accelerometer Search for Ultralight Dark Matter</a><span class="id">[2509.12175]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>We use a cavity optomechanical accelerometer to perform a resonant search for ultralight dark matter at acoustic frequencies near 39 kHz (a particle mass of $0.16$ neV/$c^2$). The accelerometer is based on a Si$_3$N$_4$ membrane, cryogenically cooled to 4 K, with photothermal heating employed to scan the resonance frequency by $10^2$ detector linewidths. Leveraging shot-noise-limited displacement readout and radiation pressure feedback cooling, we realize an acceleration resolution of $\sim 10\;\text{n}g_0/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ over a bandwidth of $30$ Hz near the fundamental test mass resonance. We find no evidence of a dark matter signal and infer an upper bound on the coupling to normal matter that is several orders of magnitude above the stringent bounds set by equivalence principle experiments.

This wind can interact with Earth's magnetic field. For this reason, developing an accurate understanding of CH regions is vital for understanding space weather and its effects on Earth. The process of identifying CH regions typically relies on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) imagery, leveraging the fact that CHs appear dark at these wavelengths. Accurate identification of CHs in EUV, however, can be difficult due to a variety of factors, including stray light from nearby regions, limb brightening, and the presence of filaments (which also appear dark, but are not sources of solar wind). In order to overcome these issues, this work incorporates photospheric magnetic field data into a classical EUV-based segmentation algorithm based on the active contours without edges (ACWE) segmentation method. In this work magnetic field data are incorporated directly into the segmentation process, serving both as a method for removing non-CH regions in advance, and as a method to constrain evolution of the segmented CH boundary. This reduces the presence of filaments while allowing the segmentation to include CH regions that may be difficult to identify due to inconsistent intensities.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">77.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19401" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Using the antenna impedance to estimate soil electrical parameters for the MIST global 21-cm experiment</a><span class="id">[2503.19401]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Radio experiments trying to detect the global $21$ cm signal from the early Universe are very sensitive to the electrical properties of their environment. For ground-based experiments with the antenna above the soil it is critical to characterize the effect from the soil on the sky observations. This characterization requires estimating the soil's electrical conductivity and relative permittivity in the same frequency range as the observations. Here we present our initial effort to estimate the conductivity and relative permittivity of the soil using the impedance of an antenna mounted at a distance above the surface. In this technique, the antenna used for soil characterization is the same as the antenna used for sky observations. To demonstrate the technique we use the antenna of the MIST global $21$ cm experiment. We measured the antenna impedance at three sites in the Greater Concepción area, Chile. The measurements were done between $25$ and $125$ MHz, matching the range used by MIST for sky observations. The soil parameters were estimated by fitting the impedance measurements with electromagnetic simulations of the antenna and soil. In this initial effort the soil was modeled as homogeneous. The conductivity at the three sites was found to be between $0.007$ and $0.049$ Sm$^{-1}$, and the relative permittivity between $1.6$ and $12.7$. The percent precision of the estimates at $68\%$ probability is, with one exception, better (lower) than $33\%$. The best-fit simulations have a better than $10\%$ agreement with the measurements relative to the peak values of the resistance and reactance across our frequency range. For MIST, these results represent a successful proof of concept of the use of the antenna impedance for soil characterization, and are expected to significantly improve in future implementations.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">78.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Luminis Stellarum et Machina: Applications of Machine Learning in Light Curve Analysis</a><span class="id">[2504.10038]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>The rapid advancement of observational capabilities in astronomy has led to an exponential growth in the volume of light curve (LC) data, creating both opportunities and challenges for time-domain astronomy. Traditional analytical methods often struggle to fully extract the scientific value of these large and complex datasets. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used for LC analysis, enabling classification, prediction, pattern discovery and anomaly detection. However, research in this area remains fragmented, with no comprehensive synthesis of how ML methods address the specific challenges of LC data. Key difficulties include class imbalance, noisy or sparse measurements, effective feature extraction, and limited interpretability of models. This lack of a unified overview makes it difficult for researchers to identify suitable approaches or recognize unresolved problems that require methodological advances. To address this gap, this survey systematically reviews ML techniques applied to LC analysis, outlining their principles and applications in tasks such as exoplanet detection, variable star classification and supernova identification. By clarifying the current state of the field and highlighting open challenges, this work provides guidance for future research and supports the effective integration of ML into astronomical big data studies.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">79.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20712" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">High Dimensional Beam Inference II: Inference of a Perturbed HERA Beam from Simulated Visibility Data</a><span class="id">[2506.20712]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>Accurate beam modeling is important in many radio astronomy applications. In this paper, we focus on beam modeling for 21-cm intensity mapping experiments using radio interferometers, though the techniques also apply to single dish experiments with small modifications. In 21-cm intensity mapping, beam models are usually determined from highly detailed electromagnetic simulations of the receiver system. However, these simulations are expensive, and therefore have limited ability to describe practical imperfections in the beam pattern. We present a fully analytic Bayesian inference framework to infer a beam pattern from the interferometric visibilities assuming a particular sky model and that the beam pattern for all elements is identical, allowing one to capture deviations from the ideal beam for relatively low computational cost. We represent the beam using a sparse Fourier-Bessel basis on a projection of the hemisphere to the unit disc, but the framework applies to any linear basis expansion of the primary beam. We test the framework on simulated visibilities from an unpolarized sky, ignoring mutual coupling of array elements. We successfully recover the simulated, perturbed power beam when the sky model is perfect. Briefly exploring sky model inaccuracies, we find that beam inferences are sensitive to them, so we suggest jointly modeling uncertainties in the sky and beam in related inference tasks.</p></div></details></article><article><div><span class="num">80.</span> <a class="title" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04918" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Simulation Framework for the LiteBIRD Instruments</a><span class="id">[2507.04918]</span></div><details><summary>Abstract</summary><div><p>LiteBIRD, the Lite (Light) satellite for the study of $B$-mode polarization and Inflation from cosmic background Radiation Detection, is a space mission focused on primordial cosmology and fundamental physics.

LBS provides several modules to simulate the scanning strategy of the telescopes, the measurement of realistic polarized radiation coming from the sky (including the Cosmic Microwave Background itself, the Solar and Kinematic dipole, and the diffuse foregrounds emitted by the Galaxy), the generation of instrumental noise and the effect of systematic errors, like pointing wobbling, non-idealities in the Half-Wave Plate, et cetera. Additionally, we present the implementation of a simple but complete pipeline that showcases the main features of LBS. We also discuss how we ensured that LBS lets people develop pipelines whose results are accurate and reproducible. A full end-to-end pipeline has been developed using LBS to characterize the scientific performance of the LiteBIRD experiment.

In its planned 2027 launch, PBR will study Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays, Neutrinos, and High-Altitude Horizontal Airshowers from 33 km above the Earth. By operating at balloon altitudes, PBR will provide a novel vantage point to study air-shower physics while offering competitive instantaneous exposure to neutrinos from transient astrophysical phenomena. The payload's optical instrument is a 0.95 m$^2$ aperture hybrid Schmidt telescope with a 3.81 m$^2$ segmented mirror focusing light onto a Fluorescence Camera and a bi-focalized Cherenkov Camera. The payload will also feature a Radio Instrument consisting of two sinuous antennas based on the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO) low-frequency instrument. A combined gamma ray/x-ray detector and IR cloud camera round out the instrumentation package, meaning PBR will be the first multi-hybrid balloon-borne multi-messenger observatory flown. This extensive instrumentation must be combined into a radio quiet payload that satisfies the scientific needs and can operate in near vacuum at extreme temperatures, all while meeting NASA safety requirements and weighing no more than 3000 lbs (1361 kg). Accomplishing these tasks together will mark a significant step toward establishing technological readiness for the POEMMA satellite mission.
